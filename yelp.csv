"I'm a ramen fanatic. A ramen enthusiast. A ramen disciple. But, until recently I had never yet made a pilgrimage to what many consider the Mecca of LA ramen: Daikokuya. I'd been past it many, many times. But today was the day. I was off so I drove downtown and arrived just a few minutes before they opened. There was only one other family waiting. So, I took their family photo in front of the Daikokuya storefront and secretly cut off their heads in the frame. (Just kidding.)I ordered the classic combo of Daikokuya ramen, a small pork cutlet bowl and of course a beer. In this case a Japanese IPA that was hopppy but rather mild. My pork cutlet bowl arrived first. I was immediately impressed. Crisp pork nestled atop soft gently scrambled eggs with savory onion slices on top of perfectly prepared rice. Wonderful! I added a tiny bit of soy sauce &amp; ginger and then savored every single bite. My ramen arrived soon after. This was the solid savory broth I had hoped it might be. There's not much else to add. It was clear to me why this place is legendary. Go there and experience this authentic Japanese ramen spot for yourself and I'm certain you'll be happy you did.",5
"I'd say this is a hidden gem in Little Tokyo, but the line suggests it's not so hidden! CASH ONLY. I recommend getting the combination plate with the Daikokuya ramen and fried rice. This fried rice is the best fried rice I have ever tasted (not exaggerating). The ramen was great, but the fried rice stole the show for me. The ramen comes in huge portions, so well worth the price! I added a spicy miso bomb for some extra flavor. It isn't that spicy, more flavorful. I didn't add the kotteri flavor (extra fat for richness) as I like my ramen on the lighter side. The pork belly was so tender and the noodles perfectly cooked. The fried rice had several different elements incorporated inside it to make the most delicious rice ever! Despite being swamped, the staff was quick and so polite. Expect to wait for an awesome dining experience!",5
"I was so excited to go here because I love the Sawtelle location, but I was sadly disappointed. I ordered the spicy miso ramen - my go to order, but it was waaaaaay too salty. I couldn't finish it because the salty taste was so strong. My friend who also got the spicy miso said the same thing. The daikoku ramen was good though and had a nice flavor. One of my friends got the tonkatsu and did not like it - said it had too much breading and was too dry. The line here is super long - about 40 min on a Sunday afternoon. They are cash only and have an ATM at the back of the restaurant. I think I'll stick to the Sawtelle location.Parking here is pretty difficult. Ended up parking in a lot across the street for $15.",3
"I visited Daikokuya a few weeks ago after being told that it was one of the best ramen spots in the US. After visiting other restaurants who have claimed that title - Momofuku, Ippudo, and others - I can confidently say that this earns its place on the list. Although there is usually quite a wait for a bowl of ramen, we were able to be seated immediately due to it being a very rainy weekday at an offtime. We were served immediately and ordered the daikoku ramen with gyoza. The gyoza was very good - it wasn't over-steamed and had a really nice filling. It can be easy to overcook the dumplings and make it too mushy, but it was cooked nicely. The ramen itself was amazing! I am not a fan of a broth that contains a lot of sodium and garlic, and the daikoku ramen had the least amount of sodium out of any ramen I had ever tried but was still just as flavorful (if not more!). The noodles also felt quite thin, and they weren't skimpy on the meat. I didn't feel as bloated or as drowsy as I normally do after eating ramen. I actually felt quite refreshed!I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much if I had to wait in a line outside for upwards of an hour, but I surely did without the wait. As a tourist, I recommend Daikokuya to every other visitor!",5
"Were we just in LA to eat or what?! I was so lucky to have been introduced to this amazing ramen joint in LA. The original location was closed due to renovations but they moved just a few steps down the block to their temporary location. Wait-time was just about 15 minutes for a group of 5. We each ordered the Daikoku Ramen. I took my first bite and WOW! The best handcrafted ramen I've ever had. The broth was thick, rich in flavor, and not too salty. Generous portions along with a friendly waitstaff. Not much more to say- just go and try it!",5
"So we wanted to go to the original place which was closed at the end of April and will open in May. Also they have opened another placed on the same street named Hachioji with the same staff and I think the sous chef from the original place.The ramen was delicious but the wait outside for more than an hour made me a little ""hangry"" I have had good ramen in many different places and this is definitely in the top 5 places but I can't say it was above or beyond the best ramen I have ever had. Apart from the that once inside the service was quick and efficient and the servings are very generous. And I had some left for the next day. I would definitely recommend this place but go early and eat a snack just in case you have a long wait.",4
"CASH ONLY JOINT.Yes, they're finally opened again! (As of May 16, 2018). Parking: Street metered parking and paid, public parking lots all around. We work nearby and so it was walking distance for us.They were closed for a while, and so I was pretty excited that I finally got to try them out on a Friday night for dinner with some of my coworkers. Previously, I was told to try this place out first before eating at Marugame Monzo, so that I can experience the different broth versions, and yea, I gotta say, Daikokuya beats Monzo hands down! (However, Monzo beats Daikokuya Udon-wise!). My group of 4 got here around 5:10pmish on Friday. We signed in, and then waited about 15mins for our names to be called and were promptly seated afterwards. Our waitress then came over to get our drinks first. My coworkers and I ended up getting the Combination Sets, which will allows you to experience a little bit of everything:Drinks: Two coworkers got iced water and a Japanese Soda, while the other coworker got a Coke, and I got a raspberry iced tea. Each was $3 (iced water was free). Refills were available for the iced water, Coke and raspberry iced tea. I ended up getting the $18.00 Daikokuya Ramen (House specialty) + Pork Cutlet Bowl, served with a bowl of shredded cabbage salad. The shredded cabbage bowl was refreshing and tasty. Though, the dressing tasted a bit odd. It was sweet, but I couldn't figure out the tangy component of it. Nonetheeless, it was still good and refreshing. Afterwards, the Daikokuya Ramen came out, and man, the broth A-MAZ-ING! It was rich, flavorful, and tasted really clean without being overloaded on sodium. It was so good, to the point, I almost picked up the bowl and finished off the entire broth but I didn't since I was in the presences of my coworkers, lol! Also, I still had my pork cutlet to try, lol! The pork belly was delicious and definitely melts in your mouth, and the soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly as well. The egg noodles were yummy, slightly chewy and plentiful. Topped with chopped scallions and onions, I would definitely get this again. A MUST GET, especially, if you're a first time newbie (like me).As for the pork cutlet, it became more of an afterthought once I had finished the ramen. The pork cutlet itself was soft and thick. The eggs cooked with the cutlets were also delicious, but it did make the cutlet a bit soggy. However, the sweet sauce they poured underneath the rice was gross. I ended up eating just the pork cutlets and left the rice. As for my coworkers:One got $16.50 Daikokuya Ramen + Fried Rice, while the one got the $17.00 Spicy Miso Ramen with Beef Bowl, and my other coworker just got the Daikukoya Ramen itself, but he did sample some of the beef bowl from my other coworker. They all dig their ramen and took the remaining fried rice and beef bowl home. Service: Fast, friendly and polite. They got our drinks and food down, and within 10mins, everything came out. I also liked that the servers check in on us periodically to see if we needed anything else. Even though there was a ton of people waiting, we didn't feel rushed, and so that was great.Ambience and dÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©cor: Classic, retro-style Japanese decor. Large space, but cozy as well. Every square inch of space was used. If you're coming with a big group, recommended for groups of 4 people. Otherwise, if you're dining solo, or with 2-3 people, you'll get in quicker. It gets loud, but you can still hear each other. Overall, definitely worth the return. Their broth has won me over, and looking forward to hopefully dining here for the lunch hour, and/or dinner again, yay!",4
"The wait wasn't too long even though I came with a large group of 4 on a Saturday night. I was very pleased with the food and the portions provided. However, corn is $1 extra charge which was unexpected because I've never been to a ramen house that charged extra for corn.You definitely leave full with the huge portions they give. But, with a group of 4, our bill came out to $60 including tip. This is pretty pricey even for the big portions.",4
"VEGAN REVIEW:tl;dr: I tried both vegan ramens. The tomato vegan ramen was SPOT on and so delicious; I think I like it more than the spicy sesame.This place is awesome for vegans and omnivores alike! I came on 2 occasions, so I was able to try BOTH vegan options.SPICY SESAME:This was my introduction to Daikokuya, and it certainly left an impression. The ramen was spicy, but not the ""burn your face off"" kind of spicy. It was mild. The broth was comforting and the noodles had a great chewy texture. I wish there were more veggies, but besides that, the ramen met my expectations.TOMATO:I was hesitant to try this, because I was worried it would taste like marinara sauce; I was also very intrigued, and my curiosity won out. My goodness I am glad I had this. It was delicious. The broth had a tomato flavor but it was savory and not overpowering. The arugula added a nice bitterness to the broth and the cooked zucchini and tomatoes were a delicious touch. I highly recommend giving the ramen a good STIR once you get your bowl. It seemed like the broth ""settled"" so that the more broth I had and the farther down the bowl I got, the thicker and saltier the broth became. Give it a good mix and you should be fine. I think this one was my favorite of the two, and I would highly recommend it.NOTE: This place is CASH ONLY, but there's an ATM inside. Bathrooms are towards the back of the restaurant. People must wait outside and all members of the party must be there to be seated. Also, come early to put your name down on the list. The first time I came, it was 9:30pm and my table of 4 was seated at 10:30pm. The second time, it was 6:30pm and we were seated by 6:45pm. Not sure why that was the case, but come early and hungry.",5
"Came here on a Friday afternoon right around 11am - opening time but they opened maybe 15-20 minutes later. I'm not sure if that's a regular thing or not but I do recommend coming early because there was a sizeable line already and we were one of the last people to make it in before the cut off.We got the housemade gyoza, spicy miso ramen, and daikokuya ramen combo with pork chashu rice bowl.The housemade gyoza is really good and unlike any other gyoza I've ever had. If you're a fan of gyoza, you should definitely try it. It's about $6.50 so it is more expensive than usual but worth a try at least once. The gyoza are rectangular shaped and fried on one side. The skin is very thin and nicely crispy. Inside are pork and vegetable meat balls which tasted average. The entire dish is topped with green onions and they give you gyoza sauce to go with it. It's like a sweet soy sauce but not as sweet as other places. It was very light.The spicy miso soup was alright. It came with a few bamboo shoots, chashu, green onions, and a hard boiled egg. They gave us the egg entirely, not cut in half like usual or like in the photos so I thought that was kinda weird. It was also boiled almost all the way through so it wasn't really runny either. The broth itself wasn't too spicy but it did have good flavor. Not spicy at all if you're a spice lover like myself. The noodles were good though, they were egg based noodles and thicker and chewier.The daikokuya ramen was a lot more flavorful than the spicy miso. However, it tasted even better when we added the spicy miso bomb. It was like a blast of flavor with spiciness.The pork chashu rice bowl was pretty good too! It was more of a donburi type of rice bowl so it came with egg and a sweet sauce. I really liked it but there were a few pieces of pork that were a little dry.Overall, this place was a good restaurant to try and definitely recommend if you haven't tried but there wasn't anything that was super amazing that I would make the effort to come back for.",4
"I ordered the Daikoku ramen. The broth was savory and creamy, but very slightly on the salty side. Noodles were tender, and the marinated boiled egg (my personal favorite part of any ramen bowl) was well prepared. I came in on a chilly day and my ramen bowl definitely hit the spot. Service was fantastic, despite how busy the restaurant was my server was very attentive throughout my visit. The line can get really long, so be warned. The waiting list is inside, just put your name down and they'll call your name when a table opens up. Make sure to bring cash as well, the restaurant is cash only (there is an ATM in the back if you forget). If you're in the area and craving ramen, this place is worth a consideration. I'd recommend trying this place during non-peak hours, I personally wouldn't wait hours to dine in here.",4
"COST:$6.50 (Homemade Gyoza)$12 (Daikoku Ramen) I've been here a handful of times and I'm not sure why I keep going back. It's a good ramen place, one of LA's pillar's of ramen as a matter of fact but truly looking back, it's not anything really amazing.The ramen is really flavorful. They give you a good amount of noodles and meat. But again though, it's not something to truly write home about... the gyoza included.The line can be a little aggravating on the weekends but the staff does a great job streamlining things a whole heck of a lot. Write your name down the list, go check out any of the many Little Tokyo boutiques, come back and make sure you have CASH (it is cash *ONLY*).And yes, they do have public restrooms for customers.",4
"Shared the #1 Daikoku Ramen and it was a generously large portion, perfect for the two of us! The broth is rich ,not salty and savory in flavor. I love when it isnt salty and no MSG because that gives me headaches. The staff is so friendly and I love the Japanese greetings! It's a very welcoming  atmosphere at the restaurant.They are currently undergoing renovations but they are located within another ramen place a couple stores down! Glad there was a lady outside the Little Tokyo's location to redirect us.",4
"I love daikokuya. I used to go often before I turned vegan and once I turned vegan I was sad I wouldn't be able to eat there anymore. But they have two vegan ramen options and I was sooooo excited to try it. I have to say it was pretty damn amazing. I normally like the ramen at silver lake ramen more but this vegan ramen blew me the hell away. I wish I could've finished it. The fact that they gave me this much green onion alone is a god send bc I LOVE green onion!! We went around 5pm so not quite the dinner rush yet but we still waited about 15-20 min. Our party had 5 people though which is probably why! The service is great, everyone there is so friendly, the food is excellent, and it's in my favorite part of LA. what's there to dislike about this place? I love how they have kitschy Japanese pop cultural references on the walls and throughout the restaurant to add to the very authentic feel of eating in a small ramen shop in japan. Thank you daikokuya and bravo. I love you and will always love you.",5
"You will notice a note that says that it's closed/relocating, but we luckily got there just as we overheard one of the workers tell the couple in front of us that they relocated a few doors down. So don't let this sign steer you away the actual restaurant is actually only a few feet away. I had the Daikoku Ramen and he got the Spicy Miso Ramen (because he likes his tongue to be on fire ). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was a delicious, but I did wish that they put a bit more pork belly in mine. Not sure if it was just MY serving or if all servings are like that. He said he enjoyed his ramen as well so if you like spice then that's also a good choice. Overall a good spot for a quick bowl of hot ramen on a cold afternoon.",4
My 2 time in the last 3 weeks!Favorite ramen place in LA. Daikokuya is located in 1st street in Little Tokyo. There are street parking but it's literally impossible to get a spot so I recommend yelping the parking structures around here. Parking structures often charge $10 flat rate on weekends and cheaper on weekdays. You can see dozens of people standing in front of Daikokuya. You must sign in to be seated once there's space. There's a clipboard inside by the entrance. I often sign in and explore Little Tokyo and come back after 20-30 min and still wait about 10-15min. There isn't much ramen selection but they are all good. I recommend the original daikoku ramen with kotteri which adds more flavor. I have never tried miso ramen from here so I'll definitely try that next time. I got the spicy sesame vegan ramen with takoyaki. The service is fast especially when there's always people waiting to get service. The vegan ramen was surprisingly delicious. Other vegan ramen usually are bland and not good but the vegan ramen broth and noodles are amazing. Best ramen for vegans as well. The daikoku ramen is delicious as well and that's my #1 recommendation. There's free ginger and garlic at every table. Best ramen in the area.,5
"Delicious, authentic, and quick ramen is to say the least. The wait can be long but the ramen is out in minutes. The staff is friendly and the location is around cool museums like the Broad, MOCA, or the Japanese American Museum; which can be great destinations after a bowl of ramen.",5
"First night in La wanted to grab quick food. Located in the middle of Korea town.My friend and I got out of the Uber and saw the original storefront had a close sign posted up. A male worker sat outside and directed us over to the temporary location (as he mentioned the old spot was being renovated)! It seemed shady at first but helped us out, so thankful for that because it was yummy! Very friendly staff and quick to serve, quickly got our food.In terms of the ramen, not very impressed but with the sricha and red chili sauce, it got more flavor and the flavor I was looking for.This is cash ONLY! But happy that there is a chase atm across the street",5
"One of the few food establishments that is opened past midnight in LA. I decided to come here after finishing a concert at the Staples Center. Location: you can find it in the middle of Little Tokyo in DTLA. Parking: there is a parking structure across the street. That parking structure is horribly unintuitive so drive carefully.Service: they are super busy, so they may only check up on you once during your visit. They are super fast at retrieving anything you ask for. I was about to be seated at the bar, but a booth opened up as we were being seated. They offered the booth to us and we quickly accepted.Food: I wasn't that hungry but I knew I had to make a pit stop here. They offer half size of the tonkatsu for $7.50. It was just the right amount of food and I believe it was priced fairly. The broth is so rich without being overly salty.There is usually a long wait, but since I came so late with a party of 3, I waited a max of 10 minutes for a table. It's worth it if there is a short wait, but I would not want to wait hours for it.",4
"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Daikokuya's ramen, but their fried rice is my favorite and I mean absolute favorite fried rice ever. Add a lil red pickled ginger and it's perfection for me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Gotta order it as a combo ($16ish) but sometimes I just want a large order on its own. If I find out a friend is going there I'm always tempted to ask them to pick up a to-go order for me. Heats up well as leftovers too.TIPS:Don't forget, get there a lil before opening or after dinner rush if you don't want to wait for a long time. CASH ONLY. It's a small place so large groups may be waiting a long while. I enjoy it's fun decor and homey feel.",5
"Finally bit the bullet and waited in line on a Saturday night around 7:30. They said the wait would be 40 min and I buckled down for a long wait, but it turned out to only be about 20!!!!! Yay!Food: This is the best ramen in LA - definitely worth the wait. The broth has perfect umami taste and is rich but not too thick. The noodles are the right texture. Even their eggs and bamboo are somehow better than other places. The portion size is pretty big too and I could only eat about half of mine. We were pretty hungry so we got the combo and shared a salad and katsu bowl. The salad was nothing to write home about but the rice and katsu were great too.Ambience: It's very Japanese and cute. The restaurant is pretty small, with only a few little tables and booths. They have a lot of old Japanese movie posters and little figurines. I like that it feels homey and the focus is on the ramen.",5
"I live a few blocks away from this super hyped-gem and there's always a line. Why? This place serves authentic ramen and the taste is pretty on point. I've learned to beat the rush by coming 30 minutes before dinner time on the weekdays and weekends. This place is small, so they turn tables much slower. But I warn you - this place is NOT worth the hour wait. It's like any other ramen place, but more hyped. There are 3 other ramen places in the same district (walking distance) if you're super hungry too. As for food, the Daikokuya ramen (I forgot the exact name but it's their original and most popular) was good. Sometimes it's a little salty and other times - it's well balanced. I absolutely love their flavored egg and will typically order 2 for myself. The green onion topping makes this noodle soup very aromatic. The pork is juicy and packed with tons of flavor, but can be super fatty at times. Sometimes, I'll order the tsukemen if I want something more hearty and creamy. I think this place does well with their tsukemen, but make sure you get warm noodles so the broth soaks better when you dip it. It comes with two pieces of pork.Bless yourself and order their takoyaki! I love how crunchy this place makes it. We tried the house soju, but it tasted a little weird. More like bitter, hot medicine than normal soju. So you might want to skip it and order their imported beers.",4
"I know a lot of people don't like Daikokuya or at least among my friends, but Daikokuya in my mind is still one of the better if not the best ramen establishments in Los Angeles. It's really worth the wait.The broth here is to die for, not too oily, not too creamy, not too light, just right. I have only ever ordered their Daikoku Ramen and I think that you will never go wrong with their perfectly cooked chewy ramen, succulent fatty pork slices and half boiled egg.",5
"Everytime we visit Little Tokyo it's always packed. I promises myself I one day I have to try it out. Finally the day of rekconing has come. Lets see if this place truly deserves the title of being the best ramen in LA. As expected there's a swarm of people. Luckily I came prepared(audiobook) to keep me occupied. After waiting for 1 he it was finally our turn.Ordered Spicy Miso Ramen and a gyu don(beef bowl) Broth was amazing, each sip felt magical. Flavors were very robust a bit sweet, salty, most importantly VERY rich. Noodles and the pork was good, but not noteworthy. Service: 3/5Taste: 4/5Value: 3/5Overall: 3/5Was it worth the hype? Simple answer is no, there are a couple of ramen shops down the street that is comparable if not better. Overall, if there was no wait I'd be back... With the wait, I'll be at the one down the street.",3
"My wife always raves about this place when we talk about ramen, and I finally got to try it! My family and I visited this ramen shop as we were on our way back to San Diego.Street parking was a little bit of a pain in this area, so we ended up parking in the parking garage. We came at an odd time, I think it was around 4 or 5pm, so there wasn't a long wait for a party of 5. I think we waited about 10 mins.Figuring out what to order was easy for me. Whenever I visit a ramen restaurant, I almost always get the staple tonkotsu ramen or as it's listed here, Daikoku Ramen. I also added kotteri flavor and extra chashu pork, both I feel are a must. The kotteri flavor adds soup that is extracted from the back fat, and well there is never enough chashu!The ramen came out quick, in a large bowl. Presentation was it's strong suit, but the food spoke for itself. The broth was nice and fatty, though I felt like the broth was on the thin side. I would've like a thicker creamier broth. I felt like the standout item in the bowl was the chashu. I would say, probably the best chashu I've ever had in a bowl of ramen. I feel like chashu is normally sliced pretty thin, but this one was nice and thick! Oh and it was fatty too!All in all, I enjoyed my bowl of ramen and wouldn't mind coming back. I'd probably go for the spicy miso ramen the next time around!",4
"Ramen is not really good. If you have ever been to Japan or tried traditional ramen, you could find out that the taste is so-so. Believe me, the taste doesn't meet its reputation.",2
I'm from Houston Texas. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had to stop by to get my ramen fix but left disapointed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had my usual. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I thought the Tonkatsu was too salty and the chasu was over done. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'll have to find another ramen place now : (,3
"I came here on a Saturday night with my friend for dinner because she had raved about and recommended this place for ages. From all the things she was saying and the plethora of great reviews on yelp, my expectations were set pretty high.When we arrived, there was around a 45 minute wait, which was fine because we just went to walk around the Japanese Village Plaza. We were seated around 5 minutes after we returned and were left alone for about another 5 minutes. This was fine to me because they were extremely busy on a Saturday night, but my friend told me she was upset about being ignored by the waitresses.When they finally took our order, my friend got the ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_daikoku ramen while I got the combo daikoku ramen and teriyaki elbowl. The food took about 10 minutes to come out. The ramen noodles were very chewy and I noticed they gave a lot of toppings. However, the dish was $12 which was a little overpriced for regular ramen, but I guess the increased portion and amount of toppings makes up for it.The eel bowl was very flavorful, but I was surprised at the small size of the bowl. It was about the same size as when you order a side of rice at most restaurants. The eel was also another whopping $12 added to the $12 of the ramen. I understand eel prices have risen but that price is kind of ridiculous for the tiny portion you get. I also saw that the menu said combos include a salad but I never got one. If they were going to call this a combo, the price of $24 for just ramen and a small eel bowl with no salad is too much.Overall, the food was great but the service is what brought my review down to 3 stars. The waitresses did not come back and ask if we needed anything or refill my friend's water that she finished within the first 10 minutes of arriving. When we tipped a little less for their service (around $3-4), the waitresses scoffed when they saw it and started talking among themselves. They then ""reminded"" my friend in a haughty tone that tip was not included in the bill. I understand it was a busy Saturday night, but this wasn't the type of service I was expecting to receive from a restaurant with such high reviews.",3
Unique and tastyPros: Decent sized portions and good quality food. Everything is fresh and made to order. The broth is unique and definitely has a taste that is significantly different from the rest of the ramen that I've eaten at other places. You're given a good amount of meat and there are plenty of other options to go in combination with the different types of ramen that they have. Cons: The wait. Be prepared to wait regardless of time and day. At night especially during Friday to Sunday the line will sometimes almost wrap around the block. Parking is always a hassle in LA. Expect to pay to park anywhere.Bottom line: Very nice ramen. It's in the heart of Little Tokyo which is nice. Makes it easy to wander around and find other things to do while you wait to be seated. Will definitely come here again if I'm in the area and if it's possible without too long of a wait.,4
"First impression: Very cool design and it feels like a traditional noodle house. This place has been in town for a long time. I ordered their most popular item, which was the daikokuya noodle soup. It was a 4 stars because I expected to be better than other Japanese ramen place I have been to but it tastes the same. I do like the service and the price with the portion size. Cheaper than most places I've been to. Overall, I like it and would go back.",4
"Had high hopes for Daikokuya after seeing 7,000+ reviews on yelp and an incredibly long line. We put our names down around 6 pm on a Friday night and we were seated around 7:30 pm. Good thing is that you can explore Little Tokyo while you're waiting. The inside of the restaurant is really small and few seats. We ordered one Classic Ramen and one Hot Miso. The dishes came quickly, less than 5 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can tell the workers want to get you out of there as fast as possible. The classic ramen soup had good flavor, savory, but a little too salty. It comes with 2-3 pieces of chashu pork, one boiled egg, and a ton of bean sprouts and spring onion. My egg was really dry.. Couldn't finish on my own - perhaps there is a smaller half-ramen size? The hot miso ramen was average, it comes with their kotteru fatty broth, not spicy, a little sour-tasting. Overall, the soup taste is umami and yummy. But the toppings could be a lot better and interesting. I wouldn't wait 1+ hour for this again, though it was nice to experience the hype.",3
"My favorite ramen is the spicy miso from Santouka and I compare all others to it. Daikokuya came close but did fall short. Came on a Saturday evening for dinner and waited about 1 hr for a table of 6 people so not too horrible. We started with the Takoyaki which was amazing! Slightly crispy outside with a soft gooey inside that had quality octopus chunks. The sauce on top balanced it all perfectly. I got the spicy miso ramen, of course, and was pleased. The broth had good flavor but not a lot of depth or complexity to it, which is my main reason for not giving them 5*. I did appreciate all the toppings that were included (egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts) and that was an advantage they have over santouka. The egg was perfectly done with a slightly runny center. The chashu was tender and flavorful and the noodles were good but slightly more cooked than I prefer but now I am just getting picky. I really enjoyed my experience here but would only come back if there was no wait or I was craving that Takoyaki.",4
"Daikokuya is a Japanese ramen shop known for their tonkotsu broth, located in Little Tokyo, but also has several other locations (El Monte, Sunset/WeHo, Sawtelle, and Monterey Park).The menu offers various appetizers (homemade gyoza, tuna sashimi, tsukemono, shiso age, etc.), ramen (tonkotsu, spicy miso, and tsukemen), fried rice, rice bowls, yakisoba, and combinations (ramen with rice bowls/fried rice).The hubs and I came here and ordered a Daikoku Ramen and a small beef bowl combination for lunch. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My goodness, the bowl that the ramen came in was MASSIVE! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The tonkotsu soup base had their house special blended soy sauce infused within, had pork belly chashu, a marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds on top; the broth itself was pretty okay, as it was creamy and had that hint of the soy sauce the restaurant is known for. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles were slightly overcooked, but I liked that they were very generous with it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The beef bowl had shredded beef with onions and pickled ginger, and it was slightly more sweeter than other beef bowls I've had.We had a counter seating, so it was neat to see the chefs making the bowls, yelling for confirmation in receiving the orders, yelling out for orders that were ready, etc. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The place gets packed, and the seating area gets a little tight.There's a clipboard waiting list where you write down your name and the number in your party; average wait time is around 45 minutes to an hour.I'm glad I was able to check out Daikokuya, but not sure if I'll make a repeat visit.+massive bowls of ramen!+slightly overcooked noodles T___T+clipboard waiting list available+extremely limited metered parking",3
I've passed by the long line several times but today I got lucky and made it inside pretty quickly. I love the atmosphere. I started with a Tuna Roll then had the Daikoku Ramen. Both were outstanding. Really nice depth to the broth. They were pretty busy yet the service was still fantastic. I'll definitely be going back.,5
"It's a bit mind blowing to me how massive the line for this place is ALL THE TIME. Having tried most ramen places in the area, I would say...it's not worth it. The broth is good, but heavy --- I've never been able to finish it and when it's close to $15 for a bowl.....ughThe kotteri broth is made out of pork bones and lots and lots of fat. A LOT. That's what adds all the flavor and yumminess, but you'll feel heavy after. I hate that sluggish feeling. The service and green tea here are good --- they have those pyramidal bags of green tea. I wouldn't wait for this place, but if there's no wait, it's worth trying. CASH ONLY, service is friendly.THE SHORT: Good ramen, heavy broth, CASH ONLY, not worth the massive line.",3
"I had a high hope in this place because I love ramen! My boyfriend and I waited about 45 minutes to get seats at the bar (it was already packed at 4pm!). It was an interesting experience because you can see how they prepare their food. Inside was busy and small, but we decided to give a shot. I ordered Daikokuya ramen + Katsudon, and my boyfriend got Spicy miso + salmon don. The food was amazing!!! Even the complimentary salad was amazing, I had to get one more. The broth was so hearty and yummy, and Katsudon was better than any other places I've tried before. He liked the spicy miso ramen, but it was too spicy and garlicky for me. But salmon was thick and fresh. I really enjoyed my food here... I will come back if I go back to LA!Tips: CASH ONLY. This sucks... I saw some left because they didn't have cash with them. They have ATM inside, but I highly recommend to bring some cash with you!",4
"We came about 20 minutes before they opened, and only 2 people were waiting in line. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So we decided to wait as well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_One of my friends had mentioned Daikokuya a long time ago, but the previous time I was in LA, I decided the wait wouldn't be worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There was a huge crowd in front!Anyways, on to the ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was a bit disappointed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was a bit bland, just not tasty enough for me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, the noodles had the texture I liked, and it was filling.I doubt I'll be back again. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'll probably visit one of the other ramen restaurants on the block.",3
"What do you know about ramen?! I am a ramen connoisseur in fact with a PhD of noodleology. This quite possibly could be the pinnacle of ramen expression. The mecca of ramen if you will. There seems to always be a line but it goes by fairly quick. There is a retro feel from all the japanese posters on the walls and the decor which make you feel like you've been transported to a little quaint ramen house in Japan. I tried a few of their ramens and I have to say that my favorite ramen is surprisingly the spicy vegan ramen. I am far from being a vegan but this dish is remarkable and full of delectable flavor. That is my go to ramen when I am there. If you are into a perfect spicy heat, you gotta try it, it's money. And yes, you have arrived in flavortown.",4
"After so many years, this is still the ramen place I would would wait in a line for (back then, it was a torture 30 minutes... and still is). Just the mere mentions of their creamy milky broth melt away any hesitation of the long wait you have to endure just to be seated. What I love about this place over the other Daikokuya locations was that they actually dipped the ramen on to a soup broth to give it more silky texture before plating it on to the bowl. Of course, they would then pour over with the broth of your choice (long prepared pork broth of Tonkotsu or the spicy miso).The meaty chasu still melts like butter and their toppings are still made it worth ordering to lavish your ramen bowl. However, it's all about the broth! When you talked about ramen, it's the broth that separate this place from all other ramen joints. This particular location's broth still hold very endearing for me.What happened changed since my last review (which I got a ROTD btw) from more than 10 years ago? I think the most interesting thing was that they expanded the menu. On recent year's reviews, there's seemed to be more talk about their rice bowl, which wasn't a highlight back then. I also noticed that Daikokuya have expanded to many different parts of town as I wrote the first review... this place and Monterrey Park were the only locations in town. Sadly, MPK closed that branch long ago too.There are many many many new ramen joints popped up everywhere in LA, but I can safely attest in that this location is still my go to ramen place if I ever crave for the tonkotsu ramen.",5
"Every ramen place i've tried has to have something that just stands out from the rest for me to appreciate it.. Daikokuya is just that late night spot that hits home for me, just because it's the first ramen place I have ever tried japanese style ramen. Tonkotsu spicy miso. I forgot how glorious it could be. The broth is so rich and kotteri is just the icing on the cake. The broth was rich creamy and stick to your lips amazing. The noodles were the thick kind. Not my favorite, but it had a good chewy texture and was well coated with the broth. I always add a spicy miso bomb that gives me the kick of spiciness I enjoy. I like how the standard comes with bamboo and bean sprouts. I had to add a soft egg goodness. Appetizer was super filling but worth. Gyoza's are different, they are the flat ones which are still tasty and lots of filling. Takoyaki were just a ball of hotness that burns your mouth with crispy batter/tako. A plus that everything is scalding hot. (Pet piece of mine when hot food is warm). The late night rush comes with lots of intoxicated people and some panhandlers for cash or cigarettes.",5
"Came in for lunch one day and we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. I ordered the best seller and so did my boyfriend, with katsudon on the side. We got our food about 5 minutes later and they were in huge bowls. We loved the noodles and broth, one of our favorite ramens we have ever had. The wait is worth it even if it is a small location, they're pretty fast. The service is fast and the staff is friendly. Would definitely come back again.",4
"I have been working my way around LA trying different vegan ramens and THIS IS THE BEST ONE I HAVE FOUND. Get the MISO VEGAN RAMEN and you will be so happy. Even non-vegetarian or vegan friends have loved it. The thing that makes this the best one I have had is the BROTH. It has so much flavor that is honestly rare for a vegan broth. Most restaurants seem to just have a vegan option out of obligation, but don't put much effort into making it a stellar meal. NOT THE CASE HERE.The noodles are amazing as well as the veggies within. The only unfortunate thing is that there is often a wait. It may be worth trying the other locations, or if you go here in the afternoon or when it is hot outside the line can be shorter. Even if you have to wait though, it is honestly worth it!",5
"Why only three stars? Because of the wait! This is my go to Ramen spot in Little Tokyo after drinking some drinks at X Lanes or the breweries like Angel City/Arts Distrcit. The Ramen here is consistent. People wait in line for a reason...cuz it is that good! Would definitely come here more often if the wait times werent 30 minutes or more...some times up to an hour and a half. A little dusty by the bar area, would definitely recommend dusting that place up.Again, food quality is so good, that I would give it a 5 stars. But unfortunately, wait time just ticks me off. Lol. Especially if there is a crazy homeless man asking for a dollar and playing dice right outside the restaurant.",3
"Of course there is a long line! Restaurant is small!! Waiting was not an issue (we've all been to Disneyland) but the HEAT once inside was horrid,, sauna like! (I know, I could stand to loose a few pounds but,,come on) Quick... A pitcher of beer to Douse me down. Uncomfortable to the max. Feeling hot, dizzy, hunger gone, loosing pounds by the minute, opened the menu, picked a picture and said,,,this please,,OMG! Just saw the sign in front of my face,Cash Only,,,lol,,,Ok, that woke me up. Scrambled thru my pockets,,,aaahhh..okRealized they sat us at the bar,,in front if the hot stove,, more heat,, great! More beer! Ate fast,, drank faster! Gotta go!!The food was good but will come back during the next Ice Age.The one saving grace for the extra star (was going to be 2 initially) is that they have purse/bag hooks under the counter bar to hang your ,,,? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_purse or bag! Made it much easier to melt alone without killing my bag.",3
"This used to be hands down the best ramen spot in Los Angeles... Then something happened and it's just not the same anymore... Did they change their recipe? Did they change their noodles? Did they change their broth? To tell you the honest truth, I'm not sure but I don't think so. But something about it just isn't the same.Maybe it's me. Maybe my taste buds aren't the same anymore. I'm not quite sure but I remember a long time ago, it felt like Christmas when I used to eat here... Now, I probably wouldn't even wait in this long line... P.S. Its CASH ONLY and don't sit in the very back of the restaurant bc it stinks. I mean it literally smells like trash can back there.",3
"Firstly, like everyone here we were curious to know what the hype is all about ! Tell me a restaurant ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_has vegetarian/vegan options esp. spots like these I'm sold. We ordered both their veg options Sesame and Tomato I preferred their sesame more as it felt more like was eating ramen. Its a hole in the wall and you will find long lines outside this place, to get a spot you would have to wait for a min of 30-45 mins. Their portions are huge and two people can share it, says the one who made her friend order both.",4
"The one star is for the hostess. Came here a while ago on a Saturday night, around midnight. There was a small line and after having a long day, we decided to get some ramen.At first I heard the hostess call out the parties by the number on the waiting list so I went ahead and took a picture of the waiting list. The hostess alternated calling parties by their names and their respective numbers on the list. Her voice is extremely soft and even as I was standing 5-10 feet away from her, it was difficult to hear her but I couldn't get much closer since people were waiting outside as well.Eventually she ""called"" our names and we couldn't hear because of her low voice. I went in and informed her that we were standing nearby but couldn't hear our names. She acknowledged that and continue to seat at least four parties that came after us. By then, I went in again and apologized to bother and asked when we would be seated. She sassed me and said ""yeah later, just wait"". Very frustrating. She didn't apologize or seemed to care at all. The bad atmosphere made me unable to enjoy my meal ):",1
"+Thursday evening at 5:40pm - no line! We were seated immediately.+In my opinion, the highlight of Daikokuya was their exceptional customer service. It seems like all of the waiters and waitresses are from Japan and their customer service skill is top notch. Our waiter informed us that our full order of fried rice comes with either soup or salad but since my boyfriend and I both ordered a bowl of ramen each for ourselves, he suggested that we should probably opt for salad since he assumed we would want another soupy item. I thought that was really courteous of him to think ahead and provide us his suggestion. +Ramen noodles were cooked perfectly and the chashu pork in the fried rice was so good!-Cash ONLY-Normally Daikokuya has longgggg wait time. It's quite ridiculous to be honest considering that ramen was so sub-par. Daikokuya is definitely overhyped in my opinion. I think Hakata Ikkousha Ramen is way better.-I'm a pretty picky fried rice connoisseur and Daikokuya's fried rice was so disappointing. It has potential because the chashu used was good but the fried rice was too mushy. -Their gyozas were sub-par too..-No parking lot available on site. Street meter parking or look for parking lots nearby.-I'm not sure if this was a one time incident but when we went, there was no AC and it was super hot dining there. Honestly I would never come back here unless my friends want to go. There are plenty of other delicious ramen spots so I'll save my money and time to go elsewhere.",2
"Daikokuya Ramen, you are amazing! I went down to LA for my birthday this year and visited little tokyo for the first time (extremely small). We had to try this spot. The wait was only about 20 minutes at around 4pm on a Friday. I ordered a ramen combo with a salmon poke bowl. Honestly, don't order a combo unless you are very hungry. The ramen is enough. (I don't regret it though, the poke was so delicious). Combos are about $17-19 depending on what you choose. They have beef bowls, chicken teriyaki bowls, etc. There are also other menu options, but why come here if you're not going to try the ramen! That's where it's at. You're so far from me, but I will return to you someday.",5
"You build an expectation of tasty food when you try to visit a restaurant three times in a single week and there's a line down the street. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I finally decided to wait in that line tonight, and it was worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ More so because even though I was ten or so people down the list, I only really waited less than ten minutes for a seat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's no secret that I love food, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_my belly thanks me after every meal! What that really means is that I always order too much food...I ordered the ramen combination with the pork cutlet rice bowl and an order of takoyaki. It all disappeared into the previously mentioned belly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen broth was tasty, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and the rice bowl was unnecessary but excellent as well. The takoyaki came out first, but everything came out so fast that I didn't we get a chance to try it until I'd already gorged myself on everything else. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Take my advice, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_you probably don't need the combination... and I'm a big eater! It was good, by the way.. the takoyaki. The tl;dr; version: look at my pictures and be sad you didn't eat here tonight. Minus one star for cash only. That part is just annoying.",4
"This is the most rated ramen shop in L.A., so it's understandable why there were still people lining up when it's past 9pm. Daikokuya is a small, cozy place to have a casual Japanese food fix! We as a party of 3 all opted for the combination of ramen and a small bowl rice. I chose the original ramen, replaced the noodle to gluten free (usually it's yam noodle) and had a beef rice bowl. Of course, the GF noodle was inferior to the original noodle, but I just wanted to cut down unnecessary carbs :(. The ramen bowl was still, so delicious. I often rank ramen bowls based on its broth, and this place scored well. The broth was flavorful yet salty. The fact that they didnt use MSG is a big plus! Honestly, we're already full after eating the ramen. But I didnt want to waste food so I pushed to finish the beef bowl as well. The beef was marinated right- not too sweet. Our dinner was quick. We left as soon as we finished the meal cuz there were still other people waiting.I'd recommend you to come to Daikokuya if you have a lot of spare time. It's an affordable, tasty and hearty place!",5
"I eat a lotttt of ramen and have been here once. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya is one of the more ""talked about"" ramen joints in the Little Tokyo area, though there around probably 8 others within a block or so. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya isn't bad, but it's not the BEST in my personal opinion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When I expect to wait over an hour for a seat anywhere, I like to taste its worth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Again, I'm not necessarily saying its not entirely worth the wait, but I'm aware that there are a billion other ramen places in LA... Places that do a fine job, are just as ""authentic"" feeling, and don't have a three page wait list. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, if you're new to town, or are visiting and are set on the experience, then go for it, maybe you'll totally disagree. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Inside is tiny. There are a few tables, then a bar with maybeee 10 seats? There are plenty of things to go explore while waiting, just don't show up totally starved, since you'll be waiting a bit. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_(go to Far Bar a have a whiskey while you wait). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't think there's a whole lot of valet in that area- it can get pretty congested. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just find the nearest lot (it's not too expensive).",3
"I think this place is worth waiting hours for! I always order the ramen combo with shredded pork! OMG! The shredded pork is to die for! I HIGHLY recommend it! Amazing flavors! I always leave very satisfied! Service is pretty fast. I wish their waiting area is pretty small and seats are limited. So the big crowd on the sidewalk are people usually waiting to be seated. They should provide more seating areas.Parking is the $10 parking structure across the street in the plaza or street parking with meters - good luck finding one! CASH ONLY!!!! If you don't have cash, they have an ATM by the restroom OR the market a few doors down has an ATM as well. One time I was eating here, I found a ROACH crawling on the floor by the bar. That was pretty gross! These are just some of the few reasons why I only gave it a 3 stars!",3
"We wanted to grab a late night dinner after catching a play so we decided to head to Little Tokyo. I'd been to another spot a free blocks away from here but we wanted to try someplace new. Based on YELP reviews, we ended up here. It was about 11pm and there was a small line outside. Took us about 10 minutes to be seated at the bar. It's a small place. There are a few stools at the bar, very comfortable stools. There are hooks under the bar for your purse or backpack. There are some small tables for 2 cramped up front and booths. It's not high end looking but it looks like you're in another place. The decor included old Japanese ads/ signs that kept catching my eye. The wait staff was very friendly. They cleaned up tables quickly to get people seated ASAP. I had the Daikoku Ramen and my friend ordered the Veggie ramen with gluten free noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We didn't wait long at all for our food, barely 5, maybe 7 minutes. I have never had ramen this good. It was so tasty. I even tried my friend's veggie ramen and it was delicious too. I added extra bean sprouts to mine. I wish I would have tried it with the kotteri, but now I have an extra reason to go back. There was so much flavor in the broth, noodles, pork. I think this is my go to spot for ramen. I doubt will deviate from this place whenever I'm in Little Tokyo with a craving for ramen.",5
"RAMEN galore! I no longer have to wait for Japan in order to have amazing ramen. When we were in town, my boyfriend and I decided to check out this place since he hasn't been before. I remember in college we would do day trips to downtown LA just to have a good bowl of ramen. This location is right by the outside of Little Tokyo. Keep in mind that there's no parking lot in front the store therefore you either need to find street parking or structure paid parking. We parked in a structure where we had to pay. The restaurant will not validate the parking ticket so plan accordingly.Their menu consists of ramen, donburi bowls, and more. If you're looking best bang for the a buck and ton of food, try their combos. You get a full size of ramen, a small salad, and a mini donburi bowls. There's all different types of bowls ranging from chicken, fish, ad more. Pricing has gone up so expect to pay a little more than your average bowl of ramen. If you're not too hungry I would skip the combos. We came around opening and there was already a line. No surprise there. We signed in and waited for about 15 min. I know the line is a pretty long wait usually. I didn't realize there was another ramen shop that's quite new next door. There was even a longer line there! We were seated at the bar since it was just us two. I ordered the ramen and ikura donburi combo and my boyfriend ordered the ramen and pork donburi combo. It was a lot of food! Way more than what I could remember. I was a little bummed because it didn't taste quite like I remembered. I was sad how the ikura donburi didn't come with sushi rice but instead just regular rice. I should have asked though. The salad was shredded cabbage but it was soaked in dressing. It would have been better with less dressing. Hmm.... Overall it was just a regular bowl of ramen. With paying that price, it's just alright. Not quite up to the hype it used to be. Maybe it was a hype place after all? The service was quick and friendly. This isn't a place to sit down and talk. It felt like a get in and get out type of place. It was a nice place to reminisce on but now to try more things!",3
"Solid ramen place in downtown little tokyo! The line is always long, so try to come on the weekdays or during off hours. Service is friendly and fast.TONKOTSU RAMENThe ramen is perfectly cooked and the broth is salty, hearty, and full of flavor. Ramen comes with an assortment of toppings and tastes really good! Highly recommend you try the Tonkotsu because the meat is super tender!HIYASHI CHUKAThis is usually a Summer special. It's a cold salad type of ramen. Ramen with an assortment of veggies and meats served with a dressing of your choice. I got the sesame dressing and it was super nutty tasting but good. It came with avocado, tomatoes, ham, chicken, seaweed, and more. Huge plate of food and comes with cold ramen noodles. It's really good and will definitely cool you down on a hot day!",4
"On ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_a recent trip to Little Tokyo, I was looking for a place to have lunch at when I spotted ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya Little Tokyo. It was early but there was already a line forming and so I knew I had to check this place out. Though there were several folks, I only had to wait 15 minutes and soon my mom and I were seated at the sushi bar.My mom and I chose to get one of their combinations to split. We got their most popular Daikoku ramen and small pork cutlet. I really wanted some karaage but was bit bum to see this not offered on the menu and hence pork cutlet it was.It's been awhile since I've had ramen and so it was pleasant to try their ramen out. The broth is thick and has quite good flavoring. There was also a decent amount of noodles. The pork belly chashu was tender and also good in flavor. Overall hearty and nice.The pork cutlet was also good in flavoring though was a bit on hard. Surprisingly one of my favorites of the meal was the side salad that came with the entree. It had a wonderful mayo like dressing that made the simple salad exceptional.Do I think the food was good? Yes. Would I recommend trying? Yes. Would I line up for hours? Probably not. However I would say it was good experience and a nice little spot to eat at when in Little Tokyo. I can't say I'd be one of the many who would line up forever but if it's 15 minute wait or less, why not? ;)",4
Thee best ramen in LA. Stopped by after a night of drink and I wasImpressed so good. The ramen has a nice flavor to it and just the right amount of spice,5
"My boyfriend liked this place for their dipping ramen (Tsukemen). I personally like my ramen in broth so I could drink it after, and the tsukemen broth is salty for me (which is how it's supposed to be). I got the Daikokuya Ramen with kotteri and it was okay. The texture of the ramen was good, and the chashu was super soft and broke apart in my mouth. The broth was too salty in my opinion, which sucks because I love drinking my broth. So I wasn't a big fan of the broth.The customer service wasn't as great. They weren't attentive, and we waited about 15 minutes to get our order in. I understand what it was busy, but the workers seemed to be always talking to each other and we had to try a little harder than usual to get their attention. I wouldn't come back here again when there are other places to go to around SoCal like Shin Sen Gumi.",3
"This is probably one of my favorite places to get ramen in Little Tokyo. It is always packed and the line for the restaurant never ends. But once you go inside, sit down, and order, you start to understand just why people come in groves to visit this place. The ambiance and the food quite make up for the long wait time. It's a small hole in the wall restaurant, but definitely is one of the best ramen places compared to the other restaurants in the area. The quality, texture, and taste of the noodles vs the soup they use is a perfect combination of flavor and taste. Adding on the fact that they have some really good combinations at a fair price just makes this place a go to hang out spot in Little Tokyo. And if you're in the mood to have a drink right after or during your ramen, they have an assortment of Asian beers ready to go, served chilled always!",4
"***CASH ONLY*** make sure you got your money before coming here.. if you happen to forget, across the street there is a Chase ATM you can withdraw money from. Parking: street or in the public parking lot.My tummy is filled with happiness. Heard so much great things about this place and I finally got the chance to see what it's all about out. Came here with a party of 6 and waited less than an hour which was very impressive considering the restaurant is very compact. I was too excited and my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach but it's okay... I have no regrets!! We started with the gyoza and I got the combination meal with the spicy miso ramen w/ corn that came with a side of small fried rice. The gyoza was bomb.. super tasty and flavorful but a bit salty. As long as you dip it into the sauce it creates a balance mm mm good. Now the ramen was superb, I would have liked it to have been spicier but I can't complain the pork was nice and tender, the soft boiled egg was creamy and Rich and the soup itself was savory and was a great end to the meal. Very authentic along with the decor! I wouldn't mind waiting to eat here again.",5
"A friend brought me here for lunch. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After a long wait outside, we were seated at the counter, and we had beer and their standard and spicy ramen bowls.I loved the soup; it was warm and salty and yummy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't love the thick soft ramen noodles; next time I'll order something different.I did love how authentic this place felt.",4
"SPICY MISO RAMEN COMBO WITH FRIED RICE...You're welcome. Daikokuya is by far my favorite ramen spot. They're consistent, quick and they serve up pure yummygoodness. The broth is the perfect texture without being too creamy and the noodles are the ideal size and proportion as well; I don't feel like I'm eating top ramen from a packet when I eat here. Pack your patience when you plan to visit because there's almost always a wait, but it's worth it. They also have vegan/vegetarian options for those who need alternatives. Enjoy!!",5
"When I was a little kid, my mother bought me a Japanese glass wind chime to hang in the garden. I remember exactly what it looked like, with colorful Japanese characters scrolled on it, and little bits of red ribbon. It made the most beautiful tinkling sound, and I thought perhaps I could relive the childhood memory and find one in Little Tokyo.My lifetime friend Kay and I made the trek downtown, but didn't find the chimes. Guess the memory was not meant to be revived. We wanted to soothe our disappointment with a delicious Japanese meal. Where to go? Yelp to the rescue, and up came this little dive on 1st Street. Sure doesn't look that appealing from outside, it's an old place with a messy front window, on a section of sidewalk filled with other old, messy places. We peeked inside and every table but one was filled. That speaks volumes, and we slipped in and quickly took the last table. (We got there at 11.30. When we left at 1:00 pm, there was a line down the block waiting to get in.) The walls were filled with Japanese portraits and memorabilia, and the clientele was every kind of person you could imagine.What we wanted was one of those yummy, big bowls of ramen soup with lots of stuff floating in it. We both had the most popular dish, Daikoku Ramen ($12) with pork belly (I substituted chicken), egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and sesame seeds. YUM! Delicious broth, just enough stuff in it to really fill you up. Yelp rides again!Will come back to this place every time I can get up the nerve to drive downtown in traffic at lunchtime. (But they're open for dinner too and have a great happy hour. Have been voted ""best of downtown Los Angeles' for 2017.)",4
"To be honest, i think I'm developing a stronger affinity for tsukemen which was calling out my name here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But i opted to try their famous, regular ramen with kotteri flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Yup it was more fatty good. Yet i couldn't completely enjoy my soup because the amount of onions in it was overpowering everything else! What a disappointment. I've been to the other Daikokuya in Sawtelle, which i remembered to be really delicious. The tempura was fine and beef bowl was ok. Though those combo meals are expensive. Nearly $20 just for a small side bowl with rice. Waited around an hour to be seated, 7 pm on a Wed night.",3
"Absolutely delicious! I ordered the #1 with the spicy miso bomb and added some chili oil. Adding those things knocked it out of the park. We had appetizers and ended up being too full to finish the ramen, so I suggesting skipping appetizers and really enjoying the entree. Comparing this ramen to Ippudo in NYC, I would say Ippudo is the winner, because without needing to add anything to it, it is just perfection in my opinion, but Daikokuya was more affordable and really tasty. We did have to wait about an hour and a half though because this shop is teeny, but once we were sat, the service was lightning quick!",4
"If you're looking for some late night ramen, this is the place for you! We came around 11PM on a Friday and had about three groups ahead of us..but we were told during busier hours the wait can be ridiculous!The staff was super friendly and efficient in getting our orders in and bringing our food..I order the vegan option which was amazing! They had plenty of non vegan ramen options as well as sushi and rice bowls as well..The prices were pretty ordinary for a ramen place within the $10-15 range but it was excellent! It is a cash only establishment so come prepared..",5
"What to do ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_when I am in LA ? Eat our soul food. RAMEN! I live in Denver now and come to LA very often. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Slurping the noodles and finishing the broth. I know it is bad for me, but IT FEELS GOOD TO BE BAD. It is more than just tasty. It is a satisfaction.",5
"I came here after seeing all the great reviews about their ramen. Ordered the daikoku ramen and was sadly disappointed. The broth wasn't anything special. There were two thin slices of pork belly, an egg, a bunch of bamboo and a TON of green onion. The broth was WAY too salty and I only ate about half the bowl. Also ordered the takoyaki and it was just okay. Service was friendly and the restaurant itself wasn't very big. Come early before the rush. We got there around 5:30 on a Monday evening and sat at the last table. When we left there was a line up of at least 10 people outside.",3
"Maybe it's because they have sooo many great reviews. Maybe it was because some guy said to us, ""yes, it's fckin amazing"". Expectations are super important and mine were sky high. Sadly the food wasn't very memorable. I just remember after starving for 1.5 hours, we weren't very impressed. Wasn't bad but wasn't worth the long wait.",3
"I was disappointed when I stepped up to a sign that informed the restaurant is closed from mid-April to May 9.But, my timing was fortunate.A staff member saw my frown and walked me to the temporary space only a hundred feet away.Serendipity!I signed my name to a waiting list, and was seated only 2 minutes later.My server arrived immediately and took my drink order.The menu is self explanatory and traditionally oriented.I ordered the TonKatsu - a fried pork chop and the classic pork broth ramen (tonkatsu). Without delay, an enormous, deep steaming bowl of noodles and broth with several slices of pork was set before me.Topped with scallions and sprouts, a perfect 6 minute egg and my side of Nori sprinkled on top, the aroma was irresistible.Digging in with both spoon and chop sticks, I confirmed that all the 4-5 star reviews are legitimate.The broth is rich and tasty; the pork was so ideally cooked it cut with chopsticks; the noodles firm but not chewy.And, when I was comfortably sucking up broth and noodles, the tonkatsu arrived.A crispy, boneless, fried pork chop, sliced to be chopstick friendly.Despite being fried, the pork was juicy, and surprisingly light.My meal was deliciously seasoned and precisely cooked, as well as visually enticing.If I lived in LA, I would certainly patronize 2-3/week.Prices were exceptionally reasonable.Service was on the spot but never hovering.IMPORTANT: CASH ONLY!!! - (there's an affordable ATM in the back).",5
We came for dinner and there was a line. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Waited around 30 minutes for a table. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Once seated we ordered their popular ramen bowls. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Food came pretty quickly and it tastes yummy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service may lag here and there since they are a bit hectic and busy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Price is slightly above average for ramen bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is meters parking along the streets as well as a parking structure on Alameda/First street. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Inside the restuaurant is a little cramp but they do have a decent numbet of tables. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Today we sat at the counter to dine.,4
"Where to begin? Daikokuya has some of the best tonkotsu ramen you will ever eat. Period. If I'm ever in Little Tokyo, it's almost always because I want Daikokuya. If it's your first time, get the Daikoku ramen. You can try it kotteri style (SO rich). It has the creamiest, most flavorful pork broth you will ever try. Noodles are cooked perfectly - al dente. Chashu pork is tender, and they give you an entire egg (with creamy yolk). They don't offer the Daikoku ramen spicy, but you can ask them for chili oil on the side, or do what I do - dump half the chili powder on your table into your soup. It is so satisfying. I also tried their tuna poke bowl for the first time. I was very pleased with the quality of the fish. Tuna can be stringy and tough, but it was soft and chewy. Poke sauce was excellent - sweet and salty in the best way. They know how to do ramen AND poke.Wait times vary. It can be up to an hour, especially during dinnertime on a weekend. Most recently, I went on a Wednesday at noon, and there was almost no wait at all, and the food came out in no time (took less than 5 min).",5
"OK. Now I know why this place has such high ratings. The spicy miso ramen I ordered was almost close to being the ""BEST"" ramen I ever had. Everything in it in is how I would describe or want as my perfect bowl of ramen, good broth, chewy noodles and tender chasu. IMO Daikokuya fulfilled all those categories and then some. The broth was delicious! It was well balance, not too salty, full of fatty goodness and a little creamy. My only complaint about the broth was that it was not spicy whatsoever but overall still amazing. The noodles were semi-thick and chewy, just how I like it, the egg was nicely soft boiled and they weren't skimpy with the chasu. My stomach is now growling thinking about it.I also ordered the ikura don and that was a big mistake because it was really nasty. It was super fishy and has a weird tangy aftertaste, totally gross. My friend also ordered the poke don and that was not fresh either. So I recommend sticking to just the ramen here. It's worth the wait and you won't be disappointed.",4
"Long wait. Expect to wait in line for about an hour. It's a good option if you're coming in during off hours (late at night, early in the day) Call in ahead of time to get an idea of the wait.Get the spicy miso ramen. Noodles are fresh and broth tastes great despite the saltiness. Quality is good compared to most ramen places,but am not sure if it's worth the wait. I would also recommend trying the homemade gyoza. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've also tried the chicken teriyaki, which I thought was just alright. I would order something else next time. Ambiance: fast, casual, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_a bit noisy. Parking is a usually a headache but I happened to find a spot right outside as it was pretty late at night when I went.Overall, I probably wouldn't come here by myself due to the parking inconvenience and the long wait times. However, this is a great option if you're showing a friend who loves ramen!",4
"Great little ramen shop in little Tokyo. Very flavorful and soulful broth. I added spice bomb on the side, that way you can add as much heat as you like. Delicious and healing. Perfect fresh ramen. The best fresh made daily gyoza filled with pork and veggies. Very authentic and great polite service. Love it!",4
This is the best ramen place that I love! My cousin and I got the thicker broth &amp; enjoyed it. My fam &amp; friends love this main location compared to their other locations. Wait is long but it's well worth the wait while my fam &amp; friends go get boba.,5
"News flash. New item on menu. They have vegan ramen!!!!!Lucky us, no line no waiting at about 6 pm Wednesday nite. Usually this place has a line, so not my usual choice when going to a show at East West Players.We sat in a booth...the ambiance has a shabby but well-loved and long-iived noodle house vibe. Low-key, casual, small, not good for big parties. There is a ramen bar you can also sit at, also some small tables at the window. Booth is best.We ordered ramen, of course. The broth -- flavorful, subtle, delish. The noodles might be a little al dente if you are used to overcooking your ramen at home...but I think they are perfection, chewy curly perfection.Also the homemade gyoza, festooned with finely-diced green onions. And comes with a sauce.Also spicy tuna roll...you even get the cut ends which are placed face down and decorated with tastefully with sprouts. And comes with wasabi and white ginger.tt's comfort food, a little over-rated given the price, and the place could use a fresh coat of paint...perhaps not the best place to celebrate a birthday for an upscale type person, although me myself I love a hole in the wall like this place....BUT the pork-based broth is food for your soul...best I've ever tasted....and if it's not busy, worth going....spicy vegan ramen, try it!!!Wait staff are great. They don't rush you thru your meal. TIP: I usually park in the lot off Judge John Aiso parking lot, alongside East West Players, parking is no hassle after 6 pm. Short walk thru the plaza where the museums are, turn right and walk up the street, and you are there. CASH ONLY!",5
"There are quite a few Daikokuyas throughout LA but that does not mean that there will be no wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This location is the most popular &amp; we waited about an hour.The restaurant is small &amp; I would not recommend a big party because you will wait an unnecessarily long time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Nonetheless, once you are in, the customer service is great &amp; the food comes out fast.Daikoku Ramen: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_#1 seller. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is incredibly delicious! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Loved the juicy pork belly chase. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Very filling. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Worth the wait.",4
"A hole-in-the-wall spot that embodies the authenticity of a Japanese ramen shop. While the wait was around 45 mins, I'd say it was worth the wait to experience. Would I return? Probably not. The service was quick and friendly, as they needed to make sure the rest of the lines get served. We ordered the tonkatsu, pork with rice combo plate, gyozas with a delicious dipping sauce.Their ri-yu was spicy yet delightful. I kinda wish I had more! The ramen was semk-tasty but did not strike me as ""amazing"". I definitely enjoyed the gyozas. For the ramen fans, I'd recommend this place but I would not personally turn down the opportunity to try other spots in LA for this place. One time and that's all I needed. It is most likely the product of my liking, I haven't found a ramen shop to make me love it.",3
"Delicious broth; perfectly boiled ramen noodles; great price.Daikokyua's Daikoku ramen is among the best ramen I've had. The broth was perfectly rich for my taste. My friend asked for the kotteri flavor (richer broth) and I tried it, but I thought it was too fatty for my taste. I typically like asking for katame ramen (firmer noodles), but I totally forgot until after ordering. I was pleasantly surprised by the great texture of the noodles.The only issue I had with the food was the presentation of it. I thought that the bowl was a bit messy and the bowl was unaesthetic in my eyes.Daikokyua's service was very efficient. Perhaps due to limited seating, they really know how to get you in and out very fast without feeling rushed.Finding parking is very difficult. I came on a Saturday, and street parking is not available until 1pm. Street parking is also not very friendly... at a rate of $4 per hour. I ended up parking at Office Depot at a $10 flat rate for the entire day. It worked out because I ended up spending a good 3 hours in Little Tokyo after my meal.I arrived at 10:50 on a Saturday. There were only 5-6 parties in line and I was able to get seated at a booth when the shop opened at 11am.If you don't arrive before the restaurant opens, you will have to wait a bit. I highly recommend you drop off someone in your party to wait in line while you circle the area to find parking.--taste / 4aesthetics / 2atmosphere / 4service / 4price for quality / 4OVERALL / 3.6",4
"They changed location but the guy standing outside was kind enough to lead us to the new place. Their ramen is the best!! I wish they would take cards since it's cash only but it's okay they have an ATM inside and there is a bank just outside as well. The food was great, the wait time was decent and we left the place happy :)",5
3.5 stars max. CASH ONLY! Being a big fan of ramen noodles I needed to try out Daikokuya in Little Tokyo. I can't see myself waiting well over an hour for any food. A friend was nice enough to wait over an hour an half on a cold evening for us to get some ramen. So I finally after being seated we ordered are food.I started off with some sushi dishes and the chicken ramen noodle soup. The sushi was so so. For me you come to Daikokuya for ramen. I have to say the food was excellent. If you are a true ramen fan then Daikokuya is must. Daikokuya has been around for a longtime. The staff from A to Z is very friendly. All around you have so many ramen places to select from. You have street parking and private lot parking across the street. 2 strikes. One for parking and the other one for cash only.,3
"Does it need any more reviews? Nope. Am I gonna give my 2 cents anyway? Hell yeah.I still remember coming here 6+ years ago and trying ""real ramen"" for the first time. It blew my mind. Years later, after trying hundreds of bowls throughout the US and Japan, Daikokuya is still a special place for me. Tons of ramen joints have popped up in LA since then, catering to a range of different tastes and price points, but Daikokuya will always be one of my favorites for a simple tonkotsu bowl. Very little has changed since that first visit, and I mean that in the best way. You'll get a filling, delicious meal for under $20 easy.WAIT:The one thing that's gotten worse over time is the wait. Lines are consistently 1+ hours long, but I've gotten lucky more than once and had no wait at all. Just this Thursday I came with a friend at 7 and we were seated immediately. By the time we left around 8:30, the line was at least 20 ppl deep. Just scope it out, and if you ever see that there's no crowd in front (tricky, because the neighboring Marugame Monzo crowd often spills in front of Daikokuya), book it over. Honestly I wouldn't ever wait more than 40 minutes here despite my love for it. There are other options and it's not going anywhere. Don't wait in the line solely for the hype. Go at an odd time or try your luck on a weeknight - it's definitely doable. FOOD:You already know what to get: the Daikoku Ramen ($12), with kotteri broth (richer and made with back fat) if you're like me and enjoy a little extra indulgence. They recently introduced vegan options to cater to the LA crowd, but it's not what they're known for and hopefully not what you're here for. Daikokuya's gold standard is their fatty, porky tonkotsu broth. It's rich but not ridiculous, flavorful but not overwhelming. The bowl is always very filling and generous with toppings. I prefer their chewy egg noodles over Hakata-style thin, straight noodles, and their pork belly slices are big and meaty. Plenty of bamboo shoots, green onion, and bean sprouts round out the bowl. And of course, their egg is perfectly seasoned and soft-boiled (slightly on the firmer yolk side).I always get a combo that includes a rice bowl ($14-20) and end up with plenty of leftovers. Their shredded pork, ikura, and fried rice bowls are all solid options. Their gyoza is also one of my favorites anywhere! I highly recommend a side order. It comes perfectly crispy, flavorful and with a gorgeous golden crust at the bottom.OVERALL:I just love this place. The service is always efficient and friendly and the interior is cozy and small. Food and service quality have never changed even as they got increasingly popular, and they've kept me a loyal customer for years. Prices have hardly increased either, though keep in mind that they're CASH ONLY. For a place to stay so consistent for years on end is amazing. I'll continue coming back for years to come.",5
"I'm not a big ramen person. Although I've only been to a few ramen shops, I feel like I have enough experience to determine if I like ramen or not. I never thought much of it other than it's a quick, easy, decent meal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, this place changed my mind on the matter. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Yes, the ramen came out very fast after the order was put in, but it was also a lot better than all the other places I've had before.I had the Daikoku Ramen, which was their top seller. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It wasn't plated/bowled as nice as other places I've been to, but I only needed a picture to put up here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Other than that, I could care less for pictures of my food (but I'd really like to see pictures of other peoples' foods. Weird.) The broth was very delicious, pork belly was soft and flavorful, noodles were tasteful, and rest were as is. The boiled egg, tasted like a boiled egg, bean sprouts like bean sprouts in broth, and so on.Overall, I feel like I was lucky there wasn't a long line/wait for this place, only 5 minutes, wish it wasn't greater than 100 degrees out, and wish I didn't have such an indifferent attitude for this. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Maybe because it was so hot out and I got hot noodles, but I would definitely go back if given the option and time with or without people.",4
Ridiculously popular= super packed and long wait.Came here one hot day in the summer. Waited in a long line but was sorta worth it. It was SUPER hot inside(figure that out please) and couldn't get comfortable. Food was good tho and kinda forgot about how hot it was. Not a good place for large groups. Place is pretty small.,4
"I have been eating ramen here for over 4 years. It is absolutely amazing. Beware: it is tiny and hot af in here. you're eating soup. You're only going to get hotter. The service? Mediocre at best. They make amazing food, i don't care as long as they're not total tools. (they're not). Also- cash only seems like an inconvenience, but they have an ATM in the back. It seems that they recently 'remodeled' adding two more tables, and a few new items to their menu. I always get the Miso Spicy Ramen with Bamboo and it is amazing. Especially for $10-$12 I live about an hour away, and I still drive here for the best ramen. It is hearty, flavorful, and filling. We also have the side chicken bowl sometimes which is also amazing and flavorful. The beer is decently priced at $4 for a glass or $20 for a pitcher. We had sake and really enjoyed ourselves. Definitely recommended for anyone who likes ramen. Get ready to have your taste buds blown!",5
"I'm just gonna say it; the ramen was not good. It is very plain and simple. The broth is not very flavorful and when eaten with the noodles, it's very bland. The noodles themselves are good; great texture and doneness but it's disappointing to see just spring onions, bean sprouts, cha siu and an egg. So basic. It reminded me of those freshly made ramen noodles with instant broth in a pouch at the Japanese market. Maybe seeing the line hyped me up but the entire time I was completely baffled why people come here for the ramen at all. My sister, who lives in LA, kept telling me 'I TOLD you so! Their ramen is whatever! BUT you should try their Shredded Pork Bowl! It's soooo good!"" annnd so I did. I ordered their Shredded Pork Bowl and their Beef Bowl. I'm usually not a fan of pork in general but WOW was she right! Their Shredded Pork Bowl is one of the best donburi I've ever had! It kicked that ramen and beef bowl's butt! I would definitely come back and stand in that line just for their Shredded Pork Bowl again!Also for legit ramen come to the Bay Area and make a visit to Ramen Dojo, and/or Ramen Parlor! That'll definitely step your ramen game up!",4
"""It's summer time and living is easy. Catfish are jumpin', &amp; the cotton is high."" Well, there is no cotton growing in Japan, but there are catfish. Summer in most of Japan except for the northern big island of Hokkaido- is extremely humid, muggy, swelteringly hot. Those who know New Orleans or Washington DC will understand. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So in July &amp; August the cuisine in Japan many times switches over to cold foods such as cold Soba or sometimes Udon noodles which are dipped into a cold Dashi/broth of bonito &amp; Sho-yu/soy sauce where grated ginger, chopped green onions, bit of Wasabi is added. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Kaki Ko-ri/Japanese style shaved ice which is fluffy as new fallen snow w/ sweet fruit syrup added or as Kintoki, where sweet, braised brown Azuki beans, serves as a topping. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_In restaurants specializing in Ra-men, there is a cold noodle dish called Hiyashi Chu-ka. Daikokuya's Hiyashi Chu-ka has great Ra-men noodles which have Koshi/stretchiness &amp; Hagotae/al dente qualities. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Ra-men noodle are not starch nor mushy which is verboten in all Ra-men eateries worth its salt. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya allows two option for sauces: standard Ponzu style which includes Sho-yu, Japanese rice vinegar, citrus juice, Dashi/broth made from Bonito. The other is Goma/white sesame puree, Sho-yu, Japanese rice vinegar with a pronounced sweet tone. I chose the Goma since it has a toasty, fatty, nutty undertone as well as an agrodolce/sweet-sour gastrique. The toppings include blanched Moyashi/bean sprouts; julienned soft, watery cucumber of unknown variety; sliced barely ripe, ""leathery"" tomato; julienned sweetened yellow egg omelette; sliced Cha-shu-/bbq fatty pork; Beni Sho-ga/red pickled ginger; ripe, luscious avocado; finely cut chiffonade of Nori/black seaweed; dollop of sharp, fragrant yellow mustard; extremely salty thick julienned standard American ham. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_To me. the toppings ratio seems a bit unbalanced. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ham should be more finely julienned so the salty meatiness can be more evenly distributed when the Hiyashi Chuka is mixed up. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The cucumber should be julienned Japanese cucumber which is crispy to give a textural contrast to the silkier, softer Ra-men noodles. Riper tomatoes would give off ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_more tomato fragrance as well as a nicer softer mouth feel. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is so much sweet omelette that it reminds me of an eggy dessert. Chopped green onion or purple onion would add a bit of sulfurous funk that would be a nice counterpoint to all the meatiness of the ham &amp; Cha-shu-. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A bit of finely shredded cabbage would add more texture to this cold dish as well as countering the excessive saltiness of the mediocre ham.Love the old school early 1960's decor with old movie posters and songs of that era playing in the background. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_To old timers, all this transports one to the 35th Year of the reign of the Sho-wa Emperor. All in all, this Hiyashi Chu-ka is about 3+ Yelp stars, but the waiter &amp; especially the waitress were so helpful, friendly, cheerful, thinking ahead in almost anticipating the customer's requests while creating a hospitable atmosphere that I am inclined to up it to 4- Yelp stars. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Another plus is that Daikokuya is open until 12am on a MONDAY night when most other eateries would be closed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I took most of the Hiyashi Chu-ka home &amp; added all the missing ingredients as well as slicing some of the toppings to a more finely cut proportion, and the Hiyashi Chu-ka came out just fine.",4
"Hmm was hoping I'd like the ramen a lot more based on the reviews. I got the spicy miso ramen, which I felt like lacked a good amount of flavor. The noodles themselves were really good, but the broth left a lot to be desired. Overall it's a decent spot for ramen, but I wouldn't say it's anything special.",3
"Not sure what happened. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered hiyashi chuka the other evening and was very disappointed that the chef (perhaps a new employee?) clearly didn't know how to make it correctly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth prepared for it contained too much soy sauce and absolutely no vinegar. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I lived in Japan for many years and know very well how it should taste. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Unfortunately, the way it was prepared this time rendered it both unrecognizable as hiyashi chuka and almost unpalatable. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was also disappointed that Daikokuya left my feedback emails regarding the problem unanswered.",1
I stopped here for a later lunch with my friend and were surprised at the lack of line. There is usually one waiting out the door since it is so popular. We put our name on the list and then only waited around 5 minutes to be seated. The ramen options on this menu are amazing sounding with add ons you can include for extra. It was around $12-$15 for a bowl but it was very large and well worth it for the flavors alone. The inside was cute and I'd recommend a visit if you can make it! It is cash only.,5
"I love Daikokuya. Food: 5 starsService: 3 starsCleanliness: 1 starThe food here is always good. I always get either regular ramen or spicy miso. They're both good, with spicy miso being a bit fattier and richer. The egg is always perfect, and the noodles are good.I'm curious to try the tomato broth, but the waitress refused a tiny sip of a sample. Too bad, maybe I'll like it, but I'll never know. I'm not adventurous enough to possibly waste a whole meal on a ramen I may not like. It was hard to flag anyone down for water, possibly because it's so busy, but she also didn't have to seem bothered when I asked either.Their glass where the bar is is absolutely filthy. There is debris all over the floor that everyone just kind of steps over (chopstick papers, straws, etc). This place needs a bit of deep, deep cleaning. Makes me a bit wary to eat here, but at least it's tasty.",3
"Ramen craving? Daikokuya is the way to go! I stop in whenever I'm in town and absolutely love it. We came right when it opened to avoid the line. Despite the steep price for the lack of complimentary toppings, to me it's still one of the best ramen ever. They have such a flavorful, rich broth, and the pork- my God. Yuuuuum. They don't skimp out on the noodles either (woohoo!). I just came back from Japan too and honestly, Daikokuya is as close as it gets, both food and atmosphere-wise. Felt like I was back- loved it.Only downside was the Ikura (salmon roe) bowl. The color and taste was off- it was oddly sour and bitter- wouldn't recommend it. Aside from that, I will definitely be back again!",4
"Food: 3.0 of 5.0Service: 4.0 of 5.0Environment: 3.0 of 5.0Spicy Miso RamenDaikoku Ramen w/ kotteriDaikoku Ramen + Small Pork Cutlet Combo Decent ramen at a reasonable price near DTLA. The restaurant was poppin! Had to wait a solid 30 minutes to be seated. The ramen was decent but lacked a richness that I usually crave and receive from great ramen. Their food felt rushed in preparation and presentation, almost like they went down a buffet line and threw things together. The egg inside the ramen was overcooked along with the pork cutlet (dried out). Service was attentive and friendly so kudos for that. Environment is busy, loud and cramped but that's to be expected. Just wish it were a bit cleaner.",3
"Not sure what the big deal is about this place - sure lines are long and it is always crowded so it MUST be good right? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Nope!We ordered the Daikokuya ramen and a gyoza. Food was meh and bland. We've tasted better. Service is good - very attentive for water, seating you, and clearing you out asap for the next patrons. Walk in and sign your name and number of people onto the clipboard. Wait outside till you are called. Our hotel staff across the street recommended a different ramen place that is more authentic and traditional, but we didn't listen as we assumed the lines of people couldn't be wrong. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Bathrooms are busy and not too clean. Servers are efficient but unfriendly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Broth was ok - but not a ""wow"". Try the other ramen shop closest to the Japanese American Natl Museum.",2
"OMG! It is worth waiting! I came here serval times but this time I would actually write a review.First of all, the food tastes so good. Like hella good!!!!!!!Second plus goes to the size of ramen. It is hug!!! LOL My stomach is big, pls no judge.Let's give a thumbs up to customer service. So friendly, professional and nice!I would recommend everyone to try out! P/S: If you first time to try, you can call a combo which includes Ramen + a side of something else. My bud and I tried ramen and rice bowl this time cause he didn't try this restaurant before. It's great to share an experience with your friends, isn't it?",5
Definitely recommend this place! Very small restaurant and the wait can be really long during rush hours. But definitely worth the wait. Food: we got the spicy miso ramen and the small pork cutlet rice bowl. The ramen was on point. The noodles weren't too hard or soft. The broth wasn't too salty nor heavy. It was delicious. The rice bowl too was great. The chicken was a little dry but overall good. We also got the takoyaki but it was a little disappointing. There wasn't that much octopus but a lot of filling. And it was too oily for my liking. Service: it was great. They definitely know how to keep up with the busy restaurant. The food came on time and the service was nice Would definitely recommend and would go back to this place,4
"If there isn't a line out the door in front of Daikokuya (especially in Little Tokyo) then you went to the wrong place. That said, I personally think it's worth the wait. If you're with a group the wait time is usually 30minutes to an hour so you should write your name before exploring surrounding areas. Groups of 6 will have a much harder time because the place is tiny. It was rough for my party cause two of us sat on stool at the end of the table. Elbows were definitely bumping but I appreciate their efforts to accommodate us. SPICY MISO RAMEN - $13 - Note: It says spicy but it is not, in my opinion. Regardless, I still like the spicy broth more than the normal one. Spicy miso ramen also comes with the kotteri flavor which is essentially fat. If that sounds unappealing you might want to ask them not to give you that flavoring. For the spicy miso broth I think the kotteri is a bit much but in the original broth it's a great addition (free of charge). Portion is huge! I was starving when I sat down but still couldn't finish it all. Final thoughts: If you haven't been, then try it! Their menu is limited so if that isn't your thing then this might not be your place.",4
Wow!! Their vegan sesame ramen was delicious!I've tried various vegan ramens in japan but this one definitely topped all of them. They did a great job with their broth and it wasn't oily/greasy at all. For $13 I received a generous amount of noodles. They also have a tomato gluten free ramen as well for those who are gf and vegan! My brother ordered the popular pork combo with the salad and rice and also loved it. They were also generous portions and he ended up not being able to finish the whole set! We both agreed it was worth the 1 hr wait and the waiters were extremely kind and friendly :) recommend!,5
"Soup base is really addicting. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_One of my favorite ramen place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Must get the Daikoku Ramen.Came in for lunch and was seated in 10 min (well, it was a weekday). The service was quick and very friendly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikoku Ramen - Tonkotsu soup base is on point! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Also, I really like how flexible you can be with your order. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can ask for a richer soup base, add extra toppings to your liking, and also change the firmness of the chijire style egg noodles (which goes so well with the soup). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And of course, can't forget about the soft tender kurobuta pork belly chasu (had to order more)Overall an awesome place, will be coming back real soon. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Definitely recommend!!",5
"This is my favorite place for ramen, hands down!Came here with my GF and it is cash only.I get the regular chashu ramen, and I believe the creamy broth and delectable noodles here are the best! Expect a wait around mealtimes and it's a fun location near all the shops and Japanese American Museum.",5
"With almost 7000 reviews not sure what more I can add. When looking for some good ramen in the morning there was a pick of a few restaurants on the street to pick from. Of course I checked Yelp for some thoughts and recent reviews and a few stuck out. Funny thing. Hard to resist a restaurant where 10+ people waiting for the doors to open, Daitoku was the place to try. Good thing!I remember coming here a few years ago during a trip to Tokyo. The place has a lot of nostalgia around old school Japanese tv shows and movies for its decorations. However, we came for the food right? Yes! The best part was yet to come. Had to try the Daitoku ramen and traditional Gyoza. The gyoza had the slight layer of crispy, crunchy, and delicious outside layer. They went down quickly with the soy based sauce, and don't forget to put a little spice to give them a little pop. The best was yet to come with the Daitoku ramen. This is their speciality with thick sauce, the chashu (pork) goodness, and magic cooked brown egg. The noodles were cooked great and the flavor was amazing. Of course we drank the sauce down to the last drop. All in all good was amazing. A few other notes. Very very busy and need to come in down time or right when open. I heard a waiting is pretty common. Good, but not sure how log I would wait. HmmAlso, cash only. I get that we want to save money on credit card fees, but cash only, really? It's 2017. Who caries cash anymore. Well at least not all the time. These are some small issues, and still amazing food. For sure worth the try and yum yum the food is incredible. At least try it once. You will not be sorry. What's your thoughts?",4
"Daikokuya forgot how to boil eggs. I asked the server if my egg looked over cooked to her. She looked at the photo in the menu and apologized. She said they only have eggs like that today. Eggs cost pennies. Make some new eggs. I'm really disappointed in the lack of effort and steady decrease in quality. There's a lot of ramen shops in little Tokyo that are cleaner, no lines and have better tasting ramen. Daikokuya used to be king but not anymore.",3
"Many people told me that Daikokuya was the best ramen bar in LA that if I am only trying one, that should be the one to shoot for. Similar to other authentic ramen places, Daikokuya does not take reservations and is cash only.Spicy miso is always a good bet, yet this time, I decided to go a bit lighter and opted for the Tonkatsu ramen. While many people tended to comment on the richness of the broth, I would say that it was actually within my expectation. The pork Chashu, on the other hand, was slightly on the greasy side. Really enjoyed my bowl even though we were seated in front of the bar, right before the fire where they were doing the cooking. Suggestion: go write down your name and wander around, but make sure you come back and check on your waiting time.Next time to try: Spicy miso ramen.",5
"This place is a must try! I will say right now *CASH ONLY!!*Waited over an hour to be seated. It was hot out too. It was worth the wait. We finally were seated and I already knew what I wanted. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen. The BF ordered the combo Daikoku ramen with the small pork cutlet bowl. Everything was five star. My ramen had flavor, it wasn't extra salty. The spice wasn't overboard spicy. The pork bowl was my highlight. I didn't want to share it lol. The BF's ramen was tasty too. The salad was cabbage. I normally don't eat just cabbage, but the dressing is what got me. Delicious!! The portion size for the ramen was big too. I couldn't finish mine. I was so happy with this meal. Everyone @ our table liked their food.This place isn't too small, but it seems like it is with the amount of people waiting. There's tables along the wall, a bar area. It has a lot of old school items around which is really cool to see. Posters, toys. The service was good too. They come to check on you often and fill your water cup that you don't need to ask. Coming here was definitely one of my highlights of my LA trip. I will come back. I hate waiting a long time for food, but this place is worthy!!",5
"Maybe it's just the timing I went? But I had a terrible time eating here. I went during the end of the lunch rush on a Tuesday and I always see people lined up for this. I have no idea why people would line up for this place... I feel like it's just a hype.I got a bar seating and for bar seating I'm surprised how I got ignored throughout the whole meal. I felt like I had to ask for everything... I had to ask for someone to take my order, I had to ask for a spoon and napkins, and I didn't even bother asking for a straw even though I knew the waitresses had them in their pockets... just too much asking and I didn't want to bother them cause I know they are busy. But honestly, if you give someone food, wouldn't you look at what they have on the table and see what is missing? Anyway, service sucked and I felt like I shouldn't need to ask for some of the stuff...When my daikoku ramen came out and I tasted it... OMG.. it was salty!!! I just ate everything but the soup, which is supposed to be what makes up the ramen. I'm giving the benefit of the doubt that maybe I just came at a bad time? Maybe I got the remainder of the soup on the bottom of the batch? Maybe it's just what I ordered? I'll give it another try some other time... but I don't think I would order the daikoku ramen.",2
It was good not great!It definitely is not worth the reviews!Very small cramped placeIve had better for sure I don't get the hype,3
"Daikokuya knows ramen and this place definitely deserves all the stars it can get. I wouldn't go as far to say it's my favorite but it's definitely one of the better ones up there. The wait is kind of long so be prepared!I recommend the tonkotsu ramen, the broth is very creamy and delicious.",5
The main reason i give them three stars because this restaurant is very dirty. This place is really filthy there is no other way to put. I think this is the dirtiest restaurant i ever been in my life. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We came there in the middle of the week and the line was not very long. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We put our name on the list and waited about twenty minutes. The workers were very nice and accommodating ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_taking into consideration ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the amount of customers they had. The ramen i had was very average. Also it was very salty. As far as i know some restaurants put large amount of salt in the dishes in order to cover up the poor quality of the ingredients. There is no chance in hell i would come back to this place. They need to completely remodel and clean this restaurant. There is literally dirt on the walls. I don't even want to think about their kitchen.,3
"Ramen broth was on point. I ordered the noodles ""al dente"" after looking over at another customers bowl of soup and didn't like the look of their thicker noodles. Maybe it's just me but I love thinner noodles with my ramen. Thicker noodles tend to be too mushy for my tastes. I like noodles with a little bite. If you're like me then order hard noodles. The fried rice is really good too. They have a good combo deal with a bowl of ramen and a small fried rice for around $16. It was awesome for my girl and I as we shared one combo meal and had just enough to satisfy our hunger. The restaurant gets packed so get there early. We waited about 45 min for 2 spots at the bar after putting our name on the waiting list at about 3:30 pm on a Saturday. Parking is a little tough. After driving around the block a couple times looking for street parking, I settled for the parking garage across the street and paid $10. Kinda steep but it was worth it to walk around Japantown for a bit before and after our meal. I would love to come back next time I'm in LA.",5
"After waiting over an hour for our seats, I was expecting to love this ramen. Verdict? It's not bad but I wouldn't go back. The tonkotsu ramen was a tad salty for me. The pork wasn't soft. The egg was not runny, which is what I prefer. For $12 it's a decent bowl of ramen but definitely not worth an hours wait (15 min wait then okay!!) I'm reading that a lot of people consider this to be the best ramen in la but I find that hard to believe. I think I'll check out an underrated ramen shop on my next visit to LA.",3
"Exterior = 3/5This is located along one of the street front shops - so parking is limited to street parking or the Little Tokyo Mall parking garage. Both need you to pay, so I would go to the parking garage since you can walk through the mall stores after you finish eating and there are a good number of spaces. Being a street facing shop, you can see Daikokuya by the yellow roof tarp and the crowd of people outside (usually waiting for daikokuya or the udon place next door). So on hot days or rain, it can be a little difficult to wait for this place since the restaurant is on the small side.Interior = 3/5As mentioned, this location is tiny. There is no waiting area inside, they recently converted one of the waiting areas to an eating area. So you just put your name down and go back outside. Inside the eating areas are booth or bar (or the two small tables in the front for two people each). Usually they keep the booths for larger groups, so couples or people less than 4 have a higher chance of the bar. It gets kind of hot during the summer, I don't think the air flows very well - so stay hydrated.Service = 5/5They are quick with the order especially considering how much the line can back up. Since the area is small, you shouldn't have too much issue flagging someone down if you need something. I was always too busy eating that I don't notice that my water is running low, and they were good about filling it up for me.Order = 5/5Kotteri daikokuya ramen: 5/5The kotteri is the addition of back fat to the usual Daikokuya ramen to add that extra layer of richness to the broth. I would recommend that if you are new, just to get the basic Daikokuya ramen first, and get the back fat on the side. It does taste more rich. I usually add the mashed garlic they offer as well to add even more flavor. The broth isn't too heavy normally and the kotteri doesn't make it overwhelming. The bowl itself comes with like two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots, and egg. The egg I feel can sometimes be overcooked - but it's hard to say since I usually eat my egg near the end (I just know at other places I do this and my egg is fine). The noodles are a nice consistency. I feel the pork can be a bit salty, but my boyfriend doesn't seem to mind.Overall = 4/5The wait can be long and maybe not the best during varying weather conditions. This is a good place for a back to basics ramen. My boyfriend loves this place because of it's simplicity. One downside is that it is cash only, however they do have an ATM in the back for people to use. The price for the food is alright since the quality is there.Hint = get the back fat (kotteri option) on the side if you aren't sure if you will like it. Then you can mix it in according to your preference.",4
"I think I was hoping for more when I saw the number of ratings for this place. There is no doubt the restaurant was packed, along with a decent waitlist, but it was just an average experience for me. I wasn't that blown away, except for the fact that I finally found vegan ramen.Since I was a party of 1, I was quickly accommodated and seated. I ordered the spicy sesame vegan ramen and asked for egg noodles instead, along with corn, a ramen egg, and wakame. The bowl was huge! I wish ramen was sold in half serving sizes. It was really hot, so I was more worried about burning my tongue than trying to get the flavor notes.To those looking to try the vegan ramen, I will confirm that the broth is actually really good. However, it just tasted like a more flavorful miso soup. Which brings up a good point because they have a spicy miso ramen and a vegan ramen called spicy sesame. When I ordered, the waitress kept calling it spicy miso, which started to worry me because I was afraid I would get the wrong dish. But don't worry, you will get the correct dish in the end.Other notes: Great service, expensive as my bowl came out to $20 with toppings.My takeaway is that I should probably just order the broth next time or have the noodles separately because the noodles weren't anything to phone home about.",3
"This review is mainly for the Spicy Sesame Vegan Ramen ramen, though I've had their Spicy Miso ramen in the past and it is also to die for. Let me start by saying I am not vegan and set a high bar for my ramen, having lived in Japan and it being basically all I could afford to eat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_As I'd had Daikokuya's ramen before, I knew this place was the real deal and if any place could do vegan ramen it would be this one. The Sesame broth was packed with flavor, definitely as umami as any pork broth, and not really spicy. The noodles were perfectly al dente and chewy. I added more veggies and an egg. Husband had the Spicy Miso tsukemen and loved it. Wish Daikokuya would open a spot in San Francisco so Ramen Dojo can finally have some real competition!",5
"Took a weekend trip to LA with the family. Needless to say, traffic at all hours and lines at most restaurants... so you can guess, a restaurant with an average of four stars and over 7000 reviews, how long the wait is going to be. So we got there an hour before they opened, first person in line... and in a matter of 15 minutes, almost 20 people in line. They finally open the door and boy were they good at managing lines and pumping out food. We love ramen, but don't know if it's worth waiting hours for... it was good, but not wait a few hours good. Just something you'll have to decide for yourself I guess. I've had comparable without having to wait over an hour and I don't have to even be there an hour before they open. Overall, trying to be considerate along with waitstaff hawking at your table to see if you're done because of the crazy line outside, it made things a little less enjoyable. But you could tell it wasn't their intentions. Waitstaff was all very nice. Tip for eating in LA, if you want to eat at a popular restaurant, go early, like before they open early.",4
"Wow, there are A LOT of reviews for this place, so let me get straight to the chase: the ramen is on the oily side and didn't have the rich, umami flavor that ramen should have. Maybe it's because I had the best ramen in my life in Japan just a few months prior to my visit, but the ramen here just wasn't cutting it for me.The night I visited here, a homeless lady kept coming in and bothering my sister (i.e., mumbling things, looking into her soul-type-of-stare, touching her hair). She was clearly on something and freaked my whole group out, so be prepared for possible off-putting encounters with homeless people when dining in.",2
"Some of the best ramen I have had yet, the fried rice was the best I ever had especially when you add the table garlic to it, been wanting to go here for awhile and so glad I did, we will be back here for sure, the pork cutlet was also really good maybe next time I will get fried rice and pork cutlet.Our waiter was a really nice guy with great energy.",5
"For having to wait 30 minutes in a cold (LA standard) winter lunch time, I personally don't think Daikokuya is as good as its fame. My husband and I ordered spicy tuna roll ($8.50) and Daikoku ramen with small pork cutlet bowl ($18.00) we both though the ramen spot near our apartment in NYC was far better. The spicy tuna roll wasn't fresh and didn't have anything spicy. The port cutlet bowl was soggy, salty and flavorless. The ramen was mediocre. My cousin who loves this place says fried rice is really good and maybe we just ordered wrong. Anyhow, I don't don't we'll be back considering the wait time for the average quality.",3
"I must admit I had high expectations for this place given the reviews and the huge line outside the door. So without beating around the bush, here's the rundown.THE BAD:This ramen isn't anything spectacular that will totally blow your mind. It is extremely fatty..like I'm talking you can literally see the small chunks of fat floating in the broth. It has a very gelatinous texture in your mouth. I was very turned off by this and honestly left feeling grossed out. We were automatically charged 15% gratuity because we were a ""party of 6"" even though the sixth person was my 3 year old daughter who didn't even order anything. I was very annoyed over this given the fact that our service wasn't even good and I was still forced to tip for it. They couldn't even offer us a table suited for 6 people so we all had to cram in a booth. THE GOOD:Only good part was the appetizers which are more fairly priced and frankly taste better than the ramen. We ordered two orders of gyoza and the takoyaki. Both were very tasty. Overall, I really think this place is overrated and i wouldn't make the drive back or wait in line that long to go there again. I have had better ramen at more low key spots.",2
"Really amazing!Hot sake: alrightNigori sake: better than hot imoOriginal tonkotsu ramen: freaking delicious and full of flavor and not too saltyKotteri (fat): if you want a really really rich broth you can add it, but it really isn't needed.",5
"You can't miss it. When you see the sea of customers anxiously waiting along the sidewalk, you have arrived. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya Is easily one of the hottest spots to grab a bowl of Ramen in the LA area. Located in Koreatown, it isn't without local competitors. The fact that it is the overwhelming favorite night in and night out, speaks volumes on the product this restaurant is pushing out. The Spicy Miso is my choice. The soup/broth is complex and delicious. The spice level is not at all overwhelming and you can actually taste the freshness of the ingredients. Best of all, perfectly cooked noodles. Note: As good as this Ramen is, I will say it's good to know that I can find, not better, but at least comparable quality back home in the Boston area :-)",4
"DEEEEEELISHHHHHHDespite the weather being 90 degrees, I still craved ramen. We were in the area and started to yelp random ramen spots in the area and fortunately, I stumbled across Daikokuya.Only took maybe 20 minutes to be seated during lunch time. We initially got seated after 10 minutes of waiting but we were seated at the bar and it was super hot. We couldn't take it so we asked if we could wait for a booth and they gladly obliged.This place is small and hot but that had no affect on how tasty their ramen is. I ordered the Daikoku ramen with kotteri flavor. The fat made it so much more flavorful. Despite the hot weather, I ate that like a champ. It was so good. The workers were friendly and they spoke Japanese to each other which added a little authenticity to the place. The ramen is on point here and I'm so glad we decided to try this spot. Just be sure to get the kotteri flavor! You will not regret it. It's so freakin' good.",4
"The foods good, im not gonna deny that. This is for the service.The service here is always awful, but yesterday when i went, they put down an appetizer that my party didnt order at my table. A bit of my group was in the bathroom so i figured that maybe they ordered it, and i proceeded to touch it. When they came back they said they didnt order it and when we told a waitress, she came and took the food and gave it to the appropriate table. Um, yeah i touched the food, and thats gross.",1
"The only thing that I like about this place is their gyoza, that's all. I'm not a fan of their ramen or their super long wait time. Parking also sucks because it's street parking only, and finding parking in Little Tokyo is like finding ice cream in the desert. For all 8 years of living here, I've only been here 2 or 3 times. First time was to try it out of curiosity and second/third time was to take my parents here because of their curiosity. We always came before the dinner rush began so we could get seated right away. As I mentioned before, the ramen here was just so-so, nothing to rave about. I still prefer Hakata ramen or Men Oh ramen nearby there. I've been to other Daikokuya locations like the ones in Monterey Park and Arcadia. Yes, they don't have any waiting time there, but the ramen was worst. In conclusion, just stick with other ramen places. This place is so not worth the wait",3
"The wait was about an hour during lunch on a Sunday. I am not a very big ramen person, but for all the hype and wait I was hoping to at least consider it ""good"" ramen, but the most popular Daikokuya ramen tasted very average. It wasn't bad, but not at all a ramen bowl that would make any lasting impression on me.",2
"We came here on a weekday before 6:00 and were able to get seated right away. When we were done eating, there was a huge line outside. The line is warranted, this place is the real deal. What differentiates this place from all the other dime-a-dozen ramen joints is their broth. A/C is bad here, making it uncomfortable during the summer. We will keep this place in mind when it gets cooler out.",4
"Oh, I wanted to like this place! We went on a Thursday evening at around 6PM. I wasn't expecting a line, but unfortunately, there was. It was during the holidays. We quickly put our names down and went to catch an art exhibit at MOCA - it's free Thursday evenings. When we returned, the names on the list had barely moved, so we walked around the neighborhood and went window shopping. In total, we waited about 90 minutes and while the staff were extremely friendly, they also forgot to bring a fork and our bill as requested. We needed to ask 2-3 times for both. The portions are generous but the broth, while flavorful and smelled heavenly, is extremely salty. Even after putting in most of my water into the bowl, it was still too salty. I remember watching the Japanese film, Tampopo - where the main character talks about what is necessary in a good bowl of ramen - a broth a customer would want to drink to the last drop. With our ramens, we just wanted to finish our noodles and not touch the broth. Please, Daikokuya - put less salt in your broth so we would want to drink to the last drop. Until then, we're saying sayonara.We have eaten ramen in various cities in Japan and this would not be rated in our top ten. I wish it were.",3
"Expect an average of a 45min wait. I suggest putting your name down before having to circle around looking for street parking, BUT it's definitely worth it. So glad they started serving vegan ramen! No place compares.",5
Words cannot express the flavors and scents of this amazing gastro-experience! Ramen worth waiting for! The system- although it seemed awkward and archaic- worked well. You sign in at the door and wait outside for your name to be called. We chose to wait for a booth- so glad we did- a nice intimate experience-- although the bar would have been fine as well. We ordered the Ramen- one regular - one spicy. Highly recommend the spicy- even for the weaker of stomaches- it is really quite mild but adds great flavor! Very little meat but the broth is extremely flavorful and is topped with a quail egg! Nice hot and steamy- perfect for a cool cloudy LA day! Don't order additional food- you won't be able to finish the rich broth and abundance of noodles! Walk around DLA Tokyo afterwards- great shops and interesting trinkets- super selection of face masques!,5
"I bookmarked this place as I read that it was a must when in LA. The ramen here was amazing! I ordered the infamous Daikokuya ramen and you can just slurp the broth down. The ramen came with bean sprouts, scallions and an egg. It was a good sized bowl, so I wasn't able to finish it. I also ordered the gyoza and no complaints! SO yummy. Perfectly pan fried with a sweet soy sauce for dipping.I got here around 3-4PM, and there was no wait. I could see that they were very steady in business and had tables in and out. The only con is that they don't take credit cards, cash only. It was also very hard to find parking. Had to park at a spot for $10 that was across the street.",4
"Came to LA for the weekend from Phoenix and wanted to eat some Ramen... this place had a ton of reviews on yelp so we had to try it!! It's really small inside and was super busy from when we got there to when we left around 10:30pm. Waited over an hour outside to be seated, but it was worth the wait! Got some appetizers that came out very quickly followed by our ramen. Timing on the order was very good as well as the service, just waiting to be seated took forever and since there's no inside waiting area, standing outside wasn't ideal but the food made up for it. When we left there were still about 20 different people waiting for tables... Very popular ramen restaurant in LA!",4
"There's cup-o-noodles, then there's good ramen, then there's great ramen...then I found this place and now I know true bliss! Some friends brought me here for a late night snack...and now we come here almost weekly. If undecided, just start with the Daikokuya Ramen (~$12), comes fully loaded with all the goodness and meat with no bs surcharges like some other places. Try the Octopus Balls too - they're like potato balls but way way better.Parking's the only annoyance, but it's downtown LA so it's not surprising and definitely not a deal-breaker.",5
"Me and the crew waited for about 2 hours on a Saturday night.We ordered tsukemen, spicy miso ramen, tempura, takoyaki, and gyoza. I remember biting into the takoyaki and being brought into my memories of my vacation to Japan! I wasn't blown on away with the spicy miso ramen (unpopular opinion, I know). My fiance and our friends were satisfied with their meals. If you must attempt this place on a busy weekend, do yourself a favor and don't come here with a big party. We had 4 people, it took 2 hours, you get it.",4
"This is probably my favorite Ramen place in town. To be fair, I'm not the best judge but my Japanese roommate and her entire family absolutely love this place. Whenever they come to visit we end up eating here at least once while they're in town, and they're from Tokyo, so that says a lot in my opinion. Once I ate here I never went to another ramen place, it hits the spot every time. I love their beef broth options since I don't eat pork but honestly, after seeing and smelling their extensive choices during my many meals there I wish I could. I love getting tips from people who know what the food is supposed to taste like and this one is a definite favorite with all of the Japanese people I've ever eaten with! The wait can be tedious but we take turns arriving early because it's just that worth it. They have excellent service and the food arrives relatively quickly once you're seated.",5
"I think this place is over-rated. The food is average. Ramen soup is not rich enough, the chatsu meat is too soft, breaks easily. The service is good though.",2
"In my very short time in LA, we went to two different ramen places. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This one, Daikokuya Little Tokyo, and Kopan Ramen in Burbank..Pro: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ - LOVE the texture of the noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I like them fatter, thicker and chewier.- Dig the broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got the spicy miso (not that spicy) with the fat back added. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think there were tiny bits of fat floating around in the broth, which can be unappealing to some people, but not me.- Charsu was about the same for both places.- Love the seasoned egg!Cons:- The seasoned egg was overcooked.- Cash only.- The building isn't leveled. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My seat was slanted like I was tipping forward the whole time.- Bathroom was gross.I didn't have to worry about a long wait or parking since we walked. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Is it worth an hour wait?? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't know, maybe not. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service was fast but friendly.",4
"I feel like it would be a little blasphemous to give Daikokuya anything but a 5 star, so for give me Father, I'm about to sin... ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_In reality, I think they are a 3.5. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I personally do not equate long lines with top quality. While the ramen here Is really good, I cant ever remember getting a piping hot bow. For myself, and I'm sure most, really hot soup is kind of mandatory.This place is also getting a little long in the tooth also. And if you ask me what really chaps my hide, I'd tell you that I hate that they are cash only.On to the pros...Great quality tastehaving sushi on the menu is a plus.When you bring people from out of town, it's nice to bring them to a popular spot and only spend 18 dollars ahahahahaha.In all seriousness, I do recommend this place.. I recommend people come eat here, and I recommend that Daikokuya turns up the stove and gets the soup hotter!!!Until next time...",3
"Great spot for delicious ramen and other bites like sushi, rice or noodle bowls, etc. I had the Daikoku ramen, it was absolutely delicious and my favorite ramen thus far. Staff are prompt as friendly. It's cash only and they do have an atm on site or there's a chase bank atm across the street. Average prices. Portion was about two servings. I ate half and had the other half for dinner. Would definitely come back. Usually this place is very busy, however I went late afternoon on Wednesday and sat immediately.",5
"After months of seeing the long line form outside of Daikokuya, my family and I decided to try it out. I would reccomend getting there before they open because at 11, the front is already full. You cant really customize your soup and the portions are large. Its a small establishment but the food was amazing. The miso ramen was deliousous but, I wasnt able to finish it in one go.",5
"I am a little Tokyo / arts district resident and have been for many years now. There is always a long line outside of Daikokuya. I used to be in love with this place in college.The older I got, the more sophisticated my palate got, the less I enjoyed eating here. The thing that made me stopped me coming here all together is when I literally got very very sick after eating here. Everything is just too greasy and little Tokyo has a lot more to offer than Daikokuya.",3
"My friend and I came at 11:30am and wait 10-15 min or so. Service was fast and efficient, which I really appreciated.Spicy Miso Ramen(4/5): I loved the tenderness of the pork chasu. It was soft and not too dry. The flavors of the broth was amazing, however, it was a bit too oily, which overwhelmed the entire broth flavor a bit. The noodles were also a little rough and I thought they could've had a finer texture and smoothness. The egg left me speechless. It was perfectly boiled and the egg was so soft! The egg yolk melted in my mouth and was kind of runny but not completely liquid form, which was perfect.Tofu Nuggets(4/5): Very unique and unlike any fried tofu I've ever tasted. I loved the flavor of the nugget with the sweet chili sauce. It was awesome and a delicious appetizer to order along with a bowl of their ramen. I enjoyed eating a delicious bowl of spicy miso ramen at Daikoyaku, however, I wouldn't come back again. I have tasted a much better ramen back in Taiwan and I honestly feel like if one wants to taste delicious authentic ramen, one must travel to the place where ramen was created.",4
"I've only been to one other ramen restaurant in my life which is Ippudo in New York. However, Daikokuya Little Tokyo really impressed me during my last California spring break trip.My group of friends and I went in and got seated within 10-20 minutes. There were a good amount of people sitting down but there wasn't a long wait time. I really liked the vibe of the restaurant and our waiter was cool. I ordered the regular ""Daikoku ramen"". Most of my friends ordered the same thing i did but some of them tried something different and got the ""Spicy miso ramen"" and one of my friends even decided to get the pork cutlet combo with their ramen.The ramen was absolutely amazing. The broth and meat were both warm and flavourful, and then noodles were cooked perfectly. I also got to try some of my friends pork cutlet and after trying it, I regretted not getting some for myself. We also ordered some sake for our table which was a good addition.After we ate, we decided that we had to come back one more time before we left but we never had the chance/time to come back :( This place is a must go spot!",4
"My friend kept bragging about how great this place was so I had to try it with her. We were seated within 20 minutes at dinner time on a Thursday. The place was packed but the service was great. I ordered the spicy ramen and she ordered the regular ramen. I also ordered extra noodles which I regret since the bowl was already huge. Overall, the experience was great and the ramen was amazing. For how popular they are, you would think they wouldn't be cash only which was my only draw back. Will definitely come back.",4
First time trying Japanese food before going to Japan to get an idea of the food. I loved it got their vegan ramen and it tasted good !! They only accept cash and there is a long wait !!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The staff was very friendly ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_!,5
"Fast service! I ordered the Daikoku soup with extra sho chu pork. The soup was just right! The highlight for me is the cho shu pork. It's tender, juicy and fatty! Just the way I like it.You must stop by and try this place when in so cal.",4
"This place is FUGGIN AWESOME. I LOVE noodles. A friend of mine brought me some chopsticks from his travels in the far east because every time we go out i want to get some kind of noodle. I have had ramen all over LA and I will drive dumb far and wait stupid long for this parking free, pain in the ass, palate pleasing PARADISE!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_PS- bring cash, nobody wants to pay that ATM fee.",5
"Best ramen in the area. The broth was thick, the noodle was ok. Would definitely come back.",4
"This is the God of Ramen over all the other ramen. The ramen soup is insanely delicious. I have never tried such a savory soup before. This ramen is beyond Godlike, it is legendary. The soup gave such a burst of flavor. Even a drip of soup will make you crazy. The chasu was so soft and easy to eat, the noodles were just the right level of firmness. The toppings in the soup were evenly portioned and was just beautiful. Come during lunch and the wait wouldn't be that long. Come during dinner time and the wait is long but always worth it. Worth a visit while in LA. Food: 10000/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 5/5",5
Great original Ramen. They made me feel like I am in Japanese. Good service! And I love eel bowl. The takoyaki appetizer is good as well.,4
Came across here on my way home and decided to try it out. The first impression was awesome. From the entrance I was kindly treated and seated at a comfortable table. The waiter suggested me best options from menu.I was satisfied with my food. It tasted cool.,5
"Everytime I visit Little Tokyo, this place is always packed. Long wait, must be good! Right? Today, got to kill two birds with one stone. Signed up on their list and while waiting, we went to the museum down the block. Why 3-stars?? Service sucks. Guy who took our order was rude and pushy. I felt like he was rushing us. Portions are not bad but overpriced. Their combo is about $18. Very small place. There were six of us and we have to squeeze into a four-people booth. I literally walked out of that place with neck and shoulder pain due to the way we were sitting. Food is flavorful but spicy miso was not that spicy at all. Would I go back?? Probably not if there's a long wait. Did I mention that they only take cash??!!! Bummer!!",3
"I just randomly Yelp for ramen place at this little Tokyo, and here it pop up to me. So I suggested to my hubby and we went to this ramen shop. We arrived the shop early so we waited maybe 10-15 minutes to get seated. We seated on bar. We ordered one spicy miso ramen ($12) and a set of combo daikoku ramen with a small tuna sashimi bowl ($18.50). And both of us get to shared them all. The combo set come with salad which is nice and fresh. I like the taste of daikoku ramen more than spicy miso, maybe because of the broth. The noodles is chewy and the pork char siu was good. They gave lots of green onions which I like it so much. Overall the daikoku broth taste strong to me but I didn't feel any thirsty after I ate it. The sashimi rice bowl was good too, their sashimi was fresh and tasted clean. We have a great experience to be here and glad that we came early to have ramen.",4
"I came here with my wife on a little Tokyo excursion for our socal trip. Seeing as how I had already tried shinsengumi ramen before, my wife suggested we try for daikokuya with the amount of reviews the place had as well as the ongoing hype. When we first walked up to the shop, we were surprised to already see a line forming outside he building and we scrambled inside to get our names on the waiting list.My wife ordered the daikokuya ramen which was their specialty, and I had the spicy miso ramen and tuna sashimi rice bowl combo. The portions completely surprised us. Normally in norcal we would be paying more, but the portions were much more than what we were expecting. The noodles were tasty and the bamboo shoots were nice and crisp. The chashu was premarinated and the rice bowl was a sure fire way to get us full.Our final impression of the place, it is definitely worth the hype and depending on what we can get, we'll go for shinsengumi or this place and would recommend either or to anyone.",4
Lots of reviews so had to see hype ! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ramen ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ok . Had the spicy ramen ! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_1-10 I say 4 on spice . ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The Best thing was the garlic paste . ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Very small ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_place so prepare for a line . ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_not bad . They only takecash .,4
"A really good bowl of ramen, I got the extra fatty version and like any good bowl of ramen, felt a little sick from the amount of great noodles. The noodles were well done, chewy and the broth was full of flavor. The service wasn't anything special but surprisingly efficient. Probably want to get you in and out.I'd get there before it opens as there is a long line.",4
"Daikokuya offers a very simple menu, but excels in delivery. The wait times are very long, so get there 30-45 minutes prior to the time you plan on eating. However, the wait is definitely worth it. I got the Daikoku ramen with kotteri, which is the most popular bowl here, with pork chaishu and bamboo shoots. Definitely recommend going on a cold day!",4
I will write what I really enjoyed about this placeI love little Tokyo so you definitely get that lovely vibe here I tried their vegan spicy sesame ramen! Wow what an amazing broth. I thoroughly enjoyed it!! I loved the decor it made me feel like I was in Japan again.,3
It's acknowledged as a must-eat ramen restaurants in Little Tokyo. Fortunately my friend and I were only queuing for 30 minutes. Tasty and savory soup base and chewy noodle. Ramen is covered with scallion that intensifies savory flavor. Oyakodon is good as well. Love the tender &amp; marinated chicken along with egg &amp; onion. I get the rating down because I didn't taste a huge differences compared to other restaurants.,4
"Came here on a Sunday when streets were closed for AIDS walk. I was the first to arrive at 10:45am, about 15 minutes before hey opening. This place usually has a crazy line, so it was worth coming here early. Ordered the Daikokuya ramen which came with a good portion of ramen, char siu pork, a whole hard boiled egg with the yolk slightly custard-like, scallions and ginger. Just a great bowl of noodles and amazing broth. The shredded pork bowl was the star. I'd come back just for that pork bowl.",5
"Tried the vegan spicy sesame ramen, it was excellent! They also have vegan tomato ramen and I believe some sushi rolls on the menu can be made vegan.",5
"Though it was almost a 2 hour wait when the lady told us 1 hour, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ramen was the best we've had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My son was pretty persistent on wanting to try this place so we patiently waited and it was worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The place itself reminded of a small corner shop in Japan itself. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Small, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_dark, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_hot, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and sticky. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But crowds of people line up patiently waiting outside to eat one of the piping bowls concocted by the small kitchen in the murky restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The bowl of ramen is creamy, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_flavorful, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ingredients fresh, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and noodles chewy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The right combo for an amazing bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Need to try to experience it.",4
"This review is simple. The best ramen hands down. This place has always been recommended by friends, so I finally decided to try it. The wait was about 20 minutes as people filled the sidewalk outside the storefront. You can put your name down and walk over to the Little Tokyo shopping plaza and get some pastries/desserts (fresh handmade mochi icecream!!) The ramen I ordered was the special Daikoku ramen. The noodles were perfectly firm and chewy, and the broth flavorful and hearty. The softboiled egg was cooked perfectly with the yolk being solid, yet still being creamy. Lastly, the pork was absolutely melt in your mouth tender. If you are debating between the many ramen spots in Little Tokyo, you will not be let down by choosing Daikokuya.",5
Ordered the daikoyuko ramen and the shredded pork belly bowl. Everything came out quickly and was delicious! Glad I was able to find them after their location change just a few steps down their old spot.,5
"Probably the best ramen I've had so far and I try to go to at least one place in every place I visit (I've been to Texas, Florida, Atlanta, New York). This place is small so there's usually a wait but when you walk in, it feels like you're in Japan with how everything is set up. Call beforehand to ask if there's a wait! Service: 4/5 great service. The servers are attentive and provide you with what you need. Price: 4/5 for what you're getting, the price is well worth it. Food: 5/5 we got the spicy miso ramen and their famous original ramen. The broth is out of this world. Deep, rich, and so full of flavor it was hard to stop drinking it. We asked for the scallions on the side (they give you a mountain of it) and the ramen comes with chasu pork, bamboo shoots and an egg. Everything about the ramen was amazing, from the texture of the noodles to the soup. I honestly can't wait to go back the next time I'm here. A must recommend to everyone who comes to LA!",5
"I cannot believe I haven't tried this yet! My boyfriend tried the one on Sawtelle and he said it wasn't good (so I never bother to try it). A fellow videographer from Maryland was in town, so I decided to take him here (since he wanted Ramen and it had a whopping of 7k+ reviews). Might as well try it! The most popular ramen was the Daikokuya ramen and the broth was phenomenal. It was so good and there was a beautiful after taste with it. I got the Spicy Miso ramen and it was SO GOOD. I love the small pieces of fat that melted into the broth. NOTE: the portions are HUGE!! I am currently eating the leftovers right now. My overall experience here was lovely and I will definitely be coming back!ALSO, CASH ONLY!",5
"Stopped by Daikokuya during a trip to SoCal for a conference and came here with a couple friends (one of which is also Yelp Elite). Since we got there on the earlier side of dinner, it was only a twenty minute wait, but it got packed as the evening went on.I opted for the tsukemen, and it was pretty good - the pork and egg were cooked just how I like it - soft and flavorful. The ramen and broth were average for me. I liked that they had the tsukemen option since I preferred the cold noodles on the warm day, but I'll need to try the hot ramen next time!Overall, I'd say that the food is good, but maybe not quite worth the long wait considering there are many other restaurants around Little Tokyo.",4
"This is my second visit to this hot ramen joint in LA!! 3 years ago we tried this place and it was amazing and we were looking forward to our second visit!!This is one of the most popular ramen joints in little Tokyo and many refer to this place as the best ramen in LA!!! This ramen place is always busy and we came on a Sunday night!! It's small inside and they take cash only! The place could be cleaner but its definitely not the worst! I ordered the daikoku ramen without the sprouts and bamboo BUT with extra NOODLES!!!! The broth was very tasty.... noodles were cooked good, meat was flavorful, egg was cooked perfect BUT the broth wasn't hot! It was warm and I wanted it to be piping hot!!! Service is good, quick, nice and efficient!!! Also, the hours are great.... they are open very late which is always a plus!!! They also have a good combo that includes a bowl of ramen and a bowl of rice with your choice of meat! I will look forward to my next visit.... and it's right next to the little Tokyo mall which is great!!! But one star off for the broth not being piping hot!!!!",4
This place was one of the highly recommended food spots when we were down in Tokyo town in LA. The top rated noodle spot was closed at the time so decided on this next spot. This place has a line and had to be on a waitlist. But as informed the line goes pretty quick despite the usual lines. It is a small area but I would take it just to eat gggoooodddd food!! Service staff is friendly and attentive. It is a ramen place but wanted to try their new dish--poke! And how happy I was with the decision. The tuna was fresh and sauce/marinade was paired perfectly. I am also in love with the salad dressing! I marked one star off for how hot this place was. I was frying by their bar side. Will be checking this place out again...,4
"Very overrated. Ramen and the broth were fine, but I was very disappointed with the onsen eggs as they were over cooked as just hard boiled eggs.",2
"To my surprise (based on reviews), I only waited about 20ish minutes to be seated. I went with my boyfriend and we shared a salmon sashimi appetite and both got the spicy miso ramen. We didn't add any additions. The sashimi was pretty fresh so I was pleased. My boyfriend thought the ramen was bomb but I thought it was missing something. He said it had the perfect amount of flavor. I added what I think was a chili powder that was on the table and it made it better but it didn't add the flavor that I needed. It's still pretty good but I wasn't as impressed as I was hyped up to be. I still consider coming back and getting the same thing but adding more things. Fountain drinks are refillable, yay. The prices are pretty reasonable but the additions do cost extra. Oh yeah, there are vegan and vegetarian options!Service is good but not phenomenal. Like I wish I got more refills than I did and paying definitely took awhile but nothing to bad that it made me dismiss revisiting.",4
"An impromptu trip to eat ramen at a restaurant I found on Yelp located near downtown LA in Little Tokyo. There were a couple people ahead of me but I got seated quick but keep in mind this was a rainy weekday. This was a small restaurant. I sat at the bar by myself. Food came out fast (less than 10 minutes). Gyoza came out first and I actually saw the chef make it in front of where I sat. It was very good and had good texture and meat portions. It chewy in a good way. Maybe it's because I'm used to eating frozen potstickers. Ramen- the main attraction. As the waitress and yelpers suggested, I ordered the Daikoku ramen with the kotteri flavor. The pork was extremely tender...I mean like melt-in-your-mouth, falling-apart-in-the-broth tender. Broth was great. Ramen noodles were good. They give you an entire egg and it was cooked to perfection. Bowls were good size. I really can't complain other than maybe a tad more pork.Cash only.Parking seemed limited to street parking.Check out the other stores in Little Tokyo.",5
"Great ramen, spicy tuna rolls. The gyoza had a fishy taste, which I don't care for. All else is good!",4
"Had many recommendations for this place for ramen before our trip to LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Line was long, but wait wasn't too bad. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They were very efficient in getting people in and out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Inside is hole in the wall ambiance. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Got a Daikoku, the Spicy Miso ramen and a Sapporo on draft. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Both noodle bowls were delicious, but I did enjoy the Spicy Miso more. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles were cooked perfectly, but some of the toppings were cold. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The seasoning is a bit salty, so if you're on a low salt diet, you may want to look elsewhere. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Wouldn't have mind hanging out and grabbing another beer, but the place isn't meant for hanging out as there's a lot of people waiting. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall, a good bowl of ramen and wouldn't hesitate to come back.",4
"I loved this place's vegan ramen! The spicy sesame broth was super rich and flavorful, though not too spicy. And the service was really great -- there was a bit of a wait but we got seated pretty fast, considering how many people were outside. Also got the salmon sashimi appetizer and that was pretty quality, too. Overall would definitely recommend!",5
"Cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you forgot, there's a Chase bank across the street.Anyways, I had the Daikoku ramen (tonkotsu) with the additions of the kotteri flavor and some veggies such as corn and another egg. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen was so delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The bowl came out rather quickly even with a completely full restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Each slurp of soup had intense flavors - sweet, savory, salty, everything. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles had a nice little bite. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After the bowl was done, I looked outside and noticed a long line of people wanting in. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I guess it was the later lunch rush. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was all around great. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Unfortunately, I didn't try anything else on the menu. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I dropped a $20 and headed on out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My spot was quickly wiped down and the seat taken.",5
Legendary ramen joint with long lines and good broth - the fried rice however was even more bomb than my soup! The noodles were amazing. If you like garlicky and fatty pork broth - this is definitely your spot! The spicy miso ramen was a winner(a lil salty but good) - ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the Daikokuya special w with a spicy bomb - also very good. The homemade gyoza also a delight! Get a pitcher of Sapporo and you'll be a happy camper. When rain and landslides ruin your afternoon plans - this spot cures the winter blues. Definitely a fan - if the line is not too cray cray - I'll definitely be back!,4
"Food was great. Kinda salty but it tasted alright. The meat wasn't that great. It was small and not enough to fill. Also, there was no mention of any gratitude for a party of 5. That should have been mentioned. They added tip and the gratitude without any mention of it to the bill. ???",3
"If you're visiting and want to try good ramen in Little Tokyo, then it's worth the wait. If you're local, you'll know to go early or if you happen to be there when there's a short line. Be sure to bring cash! Their best seller is their Daikoku Ramen. Their pork belly chashu is nice, soft, and delicious and the noodles are very good. You might as well get their combos, which include the ramen and various bowls. I leave happy and content from lunch every time I visit.",5
"Warning, you will see a long line or a crowd of people waiting outside of Daikokuya, but that is because the place is tiny. It makes it look hyped up, even on a weeknight. The ambiance is peaceful with nice lighting, and I like the music they play in the background.I understand this place gets extremely busy, and the servers are working hard with the turnaround of moving their customers in and out as soon as possible, but I do not appreciate them picking out all the empty bowls and plates with every opportunity they get. I had just finished the miso soup and placed it between the ramen and fried rice, and as soon as I began working on my food, this one particular server was already asking me if they can take away the bowl. I don't have an issue with that, it's just irritating because the server would constantly ask us, and as they were reaching between the foods, I am pretty sure their hand skinned the fried rice. It was bothersome how the server interrupted our conversations every time by asking if they can remove the bowls and plates. Anyway, I always order their spicy ramen, which in my opinion is alright. I add garlic to enhance the taste. Their garlic sauce is something special though. Their ramen is not something to die for lol.I honestly don't come here for their ramen anyway because I never really crave it, I come here mainly for their absolutely delicious fried rice. We always order ramen and share the fried rice. Their fried rice is definitely on my top 5 fried rice list. Also, ordering Sapporo completes our meal.Warning cash only, and good luck looking for street parking.",3
"Best ramen I've had hands down. However, one word: oily. You can ask them to go light on the oil, but it's still a LOT. Nonetheless, their ramen is delightful. I ordered mine as I always do with noodles, pork, green onion, ginger, and seasoned egg. Their pork is deliciously fatty and flavorful and makes the entire ramen dish. Their fried rice was also absolutely delicious. A+ for that. The only thing that I had that I found underwheling was the chicken teriyaki. It's a pretty fatty, chewy piece of meat, when I often crave something a little more light when I order chicken. Nonetheless, you come here for the ramen and it's incredible.The waits are pretty obscene usually, but I came on a Sunday around 2 for a late lunch and waited about 45 minutes, which wasn't too bad. Also, BRING CASH. :)",5
"The broth was really authentic and delicious. Their side dishes are also nice complements for their main ramen, even though the dish sizes are pretty decent for its price.",5
The wait is long for this place!! We had a party of 7 people so it took longer and they sat us a booth that seats 6 people plus 1 person at the end on a stool so the seating was very uncomfortable especially for eating noodles. It didn't take long for us to get our order so that was a plus. The ramen was good but felt it was a little too salty for our taste and not as spicy as I thought it would be. Overall it was a good experience but I would not go again to wait in a long line.,3
"First day in LA and I was really craving ramen. Knowing that there were some great ramen spots around, I was expecting a lot from this busy place. We had to wait around 1.5 hours, but you can walk around Little Tokyo and spend time around the area so it wasn't too bad. When we finally got in, we sat at the bar area and just ordered the regular ramen and the takoyaki. I REALLY LOVE TAKOYAKI AND THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD TAKOYAKI. So I was already Team Daikokuya but when the ramen came out it really solidified its place in my heart. The broth color was so perfect and the egg was cooked juuuust right. I ate this so fast and I would say this is one of the best ramens I've had. The noodles were good and I felt super satisfied by the end of this meal. It's the right amount of saltiness and there was nothing to complain about. I love ramen now even more.",5
"Daikokuya has become my go to restaurant when I am craving ramen, vegan ramen for that matter. Their spicy sesame vegan ramen has to be the best vegan ramen I've had! The broth is so flavorful with the perfect spiciness for me. I ordered the combination which includes ramen, a salad, and a side of your choice. I went for the fried rice for my side and it was delicious, FYI it does contain chashu pork. The interior of the restaurant is small but has a lot of characteristics, that being said there is usually a wait to be seated. If you're in Little Tokyo I definitely recommend checking this place out!",5
"My go to ramen place whenever I go to LA.If you're going on the weekend, expect a wait at least 30 minutes or more. I personally think that it's worth it because the ramen is just that good along with the prices which is well justified. I come here for the spicy ramen, I like it super spicy so it does hit the spot. I do wish that they can make it spicier but I would just add the chili powder they have on the tables. The ramen itself is amazing to me, I had other ramen places but it pales in comparison to this place. It has the perfect texture and you keep wanting to eat more. Trust me... one bowl will be more than enough for you. Regardless of how hungry you are. I mean if you're still hungry than order some gyoza. I did before but was only able to finish like one.I come in with a party of 2 and it goes by a lot faster because usually we get seated at the bar. I sat at a table once but the wait was definitely a lot longerParking... can be a pain in the butt because there's no assigned parking for this. It's all street parking so you might get lucky but I had a few times when I was driving around looking for a parking spot. I ended up parking in the parking garages. There is a fee but it's not too bad because they charge by the hour.",5
"By far one the best ramen places I've been to and to many this considered as one of the best ramen restaurant in town. The restaurant decoration has a Japanese vibe to it. We came around 2pm on a Sunday and there were 8 parties ahead of us but the line moved pretty quick ~15 minutes. I normally sign in then drive around to find parking. Daikoku is known for Daikoku ramen, spicy miso ramen, and Tsukemen ramen (dry noodles that comes with a dipping soup). I normally just order a daikoku or spicy miso ramen. Never tried the combo before because one bowl of ramen is fulfilling enough. My go to ramen is the spicy miso ramen which is always on point, the broth is rich and flavored just right to go with the noodles. The noodles was cooked to perfect and come with a soft boiled egg. The egg was boiled to perfect and still gooey in the inside.Just to top things off,I always order a side of corn and ask for extra onion on the side. If you find the daikoku ramen not spicy enough, you can ask for spicy sesame oil. Customer service was great and we were in and out in 55 minutes. They also have some vegan ramen options but I haven't tried it.Tip: bring cash since they only accept cash. Park in front sign in and go find parking. Happy eating :)",5
"Physically juxtaposed with Marugame Monzo, Daikokuya got the better of me and made me choose ramen over udon.A long list of names will likely precede you, but some cancel, and the waiting list moves fairly quickly! I probably waited around 20 minutes on a friday afternoon during peak lunch hour. We started with the gyoza appetizer, which was delicious. The filling is really the star here, as the meat was packed so tightly that the thin dumpling skin looked like it could burst any second.For your main, get the daikokuya combo! I paired it with the pork cutlet bowl, which was worth it in my opinion. The pork cutlets were thick and well-breaded. As for the ramen itself, the noodles have great consistency and are on the firmer side. The broth is rich and has a bit of a peanuty flavor. The slices of pork were fragile and indeed melted in the mouth. The bowl is deceptively large...I could barely finish my portion!I am taking off one star because I feel like the service here is a bit rushed. The waitresses are friendly, but they dropped off my bowl of ramen at the edge of the table, and it slid on its own condensation halfway off the table before I caught it. Luckily I was way too hungry to let it fall :P",4
"After visiting Japan last year, I now know why Daikokuya earns such high praise in the LA ramen game: it consistently offers bowls of heavenly broth and noodles that are on par with what's served back in the mother land. It's funny, though, seeing the huge lines here when there are ramen shops on nearly every corner in Japan that make better ramen than Daikokuya. But we're not in Japan, so this is what we've got.I wouldn't wait an hour for a bowl, but I understand why some do: the ramen really is that good. Fortunately, I've been able to enjoy these sublime servings of noodles without waiting more than 15 minutes; I wouldn't even think about going during prime time.Get the house specialty, the Daikokuya Ramen, with its melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, perfectly cooked egg noodles, and soft boiled egg. Be sure to order the bowl with the korreti flavor, which adds some of the fat into the broth and provides a richer and more satisfying flavor. I like to order a side of nori (dry seaweed) for a little extra saltiness. Service is quick and efficient and the atmosphere is packed with tables, chairs, and there's seating at the bar around the kitchen, just like in Japan. Unfortunately, the volume level is more American (loud), but at least the ramen is as good as advertised. Highly recommended. NOTE: Cash only!",5
"Got in line 25 min before opening on a Sunday morning and we got in for the first round of seating! Two of us split the classic ramen combo with the spicy mixed tuna and salmon poke bowl. Ramen is an oldie but goodie! Noodles are on point, broth was light and tasty. Wished there was a little more stuff in there. The poke bowl was one of the tastiest I've had - the pieces were large and fresh, the sauce omg so gooood. SO MUCH UMAMI. Not worth an hour wait for ramen but 25 min is ok!",4
"Holy grail of Ramen Places!!- CASH ONLY + Vegan Friendly PARKING:As a veteran daikokuya customer, I pulled over temporarily to write down my name and look at the number of people ahead of me, THEN went to find parking I knew that I'd have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes. Parking sucks, but where doesn't it suck in LA?If you decide to park in the lot across, keep in my mind they don't validate. So you can get dessert after, or maybe buy something from the shops. It's a minimum of $10 from any of the stores. Much cheaper if you're lucky enough to find street parking. I think for 2 hours you end up paying $10 anyways so might as well get some face masks or something y'know.PS. I came on a Saturday night with a party of 2 and waited about 40 minutes (including the time I looked for parking), so all in all I only spend 20 minutes waiting which isn't too terrible. FOOD:Bottomline, across the menu the food is consistently good. The ramen, however, is great. I usually go for the Daikoku Ramen!! ALSO, If you want something spicy, but don't want the miso based broth, you can ask for chili oil to add to the tonkotsu base. The miso broth is great too. Yes, there are ramen places around the area that are pretty good too. But if I'm with good company, I don't mind waiting the extra time for the quality broth and noodles at Daikokuya. It's worth it. Service is 10/10. Will return over and over again. :-)",5
This place is my favorite ramen restaurant of all time. The most affordable and best tasting ramen ever. Definitely a place to come to. It is small but that shouldn't stop you from eating here with a few friends. Best ramen place ever!,5
"One of the best ramen's I've ever had and it was vegan! Went with the spicy sesame ramen and didn't disappoint. The broth was rich, had a little kick and the noddles were amazing. Quick tip: wait isn't long if you come during the week. Arrived before 5:30, we were seated very quickly.",5
"This was absolutely delicious! Best ramen I've ever had. I ordered the daikokukyo, I think that's what it was called, whatever is the first ramen dish on the menu. The noodles were fantastic, not soggy at all and they tasted like they had been freshly made, which I think they must have been. We also got a pitcher of beer and they brought us three frosted mugs to split the beer. The frosted mugs were a nice touch. Price wise it was a little steep, but honestly the broth was so deliciously rich that I think it was worth it. For three ramen bowls and a pitcher of beer our bill was about $75 after tip. I will add that we had to wait about 45 min for a table for 3. It is very small, but sitting at the bar was also an option. You get the choice of whether you are willing to sit outside, at the bar, or a table by circling which are acceptable to you when you add your name to the list. I thought that was pretty neat. We were three friends catching up and it was cold outside so we would only take an inside table, hence the long wait. It was also a Saturday night. Even so, the wait was worth it. Best ramen ever.",5
"After a long night of shenanigans, we decided last night that a late night ramen was the perfect way to end the night. I got the Daikoku Ramen with kotteri (Back fat...? Actually REALLY tasty!) and it was everything I could've possibly hoped for. The staff were all very nice and accommodating, and they helped to make the whole experience feel very authentic (despite the fact that the whole restaurant was filled to the brim with white people). Two guys even showed up right before close who were clearly blacked out, and the staff offered to sit them and get them water. Thankfully, they got distracted somehow and meandered back from where they came.One last note: as others mention, bring cash! They don't accept credit cards, or any other forms of payment. Next time, I'll remember to bring more cash so I can get even more great food :)",5
"We went for dinner on a Saturday at 5pm without expecting much of a line. However we had to wait for an hour. There was quite a lot of people waiting to eat. When we got called in, we got tended to very quickly by a waitress. The service was extremely quick when we got in and we were able to order our food right away. We ordered fried rice, gyoza, and ramen. Everything was really good, but the order of fried rice is greater than expected. Ordering two dishes should be enough for two people. One thing to note is that the restaurant is cash only so make sure you have cash on you! Definitely coming back!",4
"I was in the area a few months ago and noticed how customers line up an hour before opening to snag a spot. Moreover, the line was down the block and continue to grow after the store opens.I planted my first visit on a weekday afternoon to avoid the wait. Their most popular item is tonkotsu broth with infused soy. This item was not a savory as I expected and couldn't really taste the soy or tonkotsu. However the chasiu and ramen were a bit better.",3
"We tried coming here on a Friday night at 10:30. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait was at least 20 parties deep. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We passed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I tried on Saturday night at 12:00am. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We had been at a concert and was hungry. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was thinking this late in the evening it would not be too bad. Nearly 30 minutes later we were able to grab a table. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ordered ramen, fried rice, and some sushi for the ladies that are not ramen fans. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen was awesome! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The fried rice was ok, but my 15 year old thought it was great. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The sashimi was ok. No matter what time yu arrive just be prepared for a wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The upside of being there so late is that street parking is available. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_What did I learn today? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My wife, who does not like ramen, wished that she got the ramen.",4
"Great ramen, super busy all the time. I come here for the ramen and sometimes I will get some gyoza, fried rice, or a sushi roll / shashimi. FOODTry the Daikoku Ramen or the Spicy Miso Ramen. Both are good. I usually get the Spicy Miso. If you don't like ramen (there's probably something wrong with you...) but they have really nice fried rice, shredded pork, chicken teriyaki bowls, and beef bowls. Pretty good pricing for what you're getting. The ramen runs about $12-$13 a bowl which is very normal. GETTING THEREParking sucks. Try the structure across the street but beware of some of the crazy drivers in Little Tokyo! The structure doesn't have the best design and I've seen a few accidents while people are trying to park there. Write your name down and go walk around at some of the shops. It can be a long wait. If you come in with one or two people, they usually seat you pretty quickly. SERVICEIf you need something: ask when they come over. They are busy. They are not going to come over 10 times to your table. You might see them once after you get their food. They are nice and get you what you need quickly, but don't have your feelings hurt if they're not fawning over you and asking you every two minutes how your meal is tasting. * * *IN CASE YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT INGREDIENTS: The Daikoku ramen comes with tonkotsu soup base, homemade tender pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, and sesame seeds. They reccomend adding kotteri flavoring, nori (dried seaweed), and extra chashu pork. The Spicy Miso Ramen comes with mild spicy miso with pork broth and thicker egg noodles (it already has the kotteri flavoring added, but you can request not having it in your spicy miso ramen). They reccomend adding corn, butter, and wakame (wet seaweed)* The kotteri flavoring is basically like bacon flavoring*",4
Combo Ramen Spicy Miso and tuna don is the way to go.The wait here can get crazy but so does the one Daikokuya in the Sawtelle area.This is an institution and the first time I came here it blew my mind. I was a ramen virgin at the time and this was sensory overload with their rich fatty broth.10 years later and they still are good but LA's ramen game has possibly passed them by. Nowadays you can find bomb ramen nearly anywhere.Good for nostalgia I suppose.,3
"Nestled in Little Tokyo across another great Ramen place (Shin-sen-gumi, where the original location in Gardena); the waiting patrons outside the tiny cozy shop, and its long list of scribbled names on the clipboard weaved a hyped atmosphere. Wait time is expected, minimum 15, especially during the busy dinner hour (we were a group of 4 and it took 25).The menu has different types of Ramen styles, but two stood out and was chosen: Daikoku Ramen and Spicy Miso Ramen. The Daikoku Ramen has an option of adding soup flavor to the broth (kotteri) using the back fat of pork, and combined with the tender pork belly chashu, placed my taste buds into a never-ending spinning top of Porkception.We were given a choice to add a small pork cutlet bowl (pork cutlet with light soup covering and rice on the bottom) to go along with the already filling Ramen entrÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©e; it was like finding a 13th donut in a box of 12... never a bad situation.The Spicy Miso uses thicker noodles, and has the ""kotteri"" infusion already in it; both has recommended toppings that range from bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, eggs, pork belly. Ramen house veterans will feel right at home while newcomers will have their questions answered by the friendliest of staff.This is also a CASH-ONLY place; Citi-bank and Chase are on the other side of the street if needed. If one aren't fans of noodles, there are choices for all taste palettes (Never go wrong with freshly made gyoza).",5
"I wanted to try this place for the longest time since the one located in 626 is not good at all. We were stuck between this place and Marugame Monzo next door but the udon place had already closed their waiting list. It was around 8:30 pm and my friend and I were easily an entire page and a half behind on the waiting list.. prepare to wait!! We also parked in the parking structure across the street ($10) so it seemed worth it to wait anyway. It took about an hour and a half for us to get seated.We were starving by the time we got seated. We both ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and we also ordered a spicy tuna roll to split. We were seated at the bar thing which was weird because the food is cooked in front of you and smells a little funny. But we were too hungry to care.Our food came pretty quickly and the spicy tuna roll was actually really good! I wouldn't say that it was worth $8 though. Definitely overpriced. The ramen though is a different story. I thought it was a little flavorless so I added chili powder and garlic to my bowl and it was so delicious after that!! I really enjoyed the noodle consistency. The meat was also melt in your mouth delicious, and the egg also perfectly soft boiled. This place definitely has one of the better ramen I've had in my life.Service was also pretty quick and luckily I was able to wait inside on the chairs so I didn't get antsy. The total came to be $40 with tip which is a little pricey. The wait was also a little bit too long for my tastes so I would come at a different time. Also parking sucks so there's that too. But overall I enjoyed it!",4
"I've always been such a huge fan of their Daikokuya Ramen, but I decided to take a step out of my comfort zone and try their Tsukemen Ramen (pronounced: TSKEK-men). It's deconstructed where your noodles and all of the goodness come on the side instead of inside the soup. It's a perfect way for your noodles to stay al dente as well! I was so surprise and loved every bit of my meal! The tonkotsu broth had the perfect amount of saltiness where I was able to slurp it by itself. The side of noodles came with a generous amount of ghenki, green onions, boil egg, and char siu. I asked the noodles to be served hot instead of cold. Usually with the Tsukemen, your noodles are always served cold since they're rinsed with cold water after they're boiled. (it's all a matter of preference, really). Let's get real and talk about their Char Siu.... The large slices of pork would break into pieces every time you tried to pick it up with your chopsticks. They were so tender and juicy, that the fat would fall right off. Put it in your mouth and it just melts! The meat was very soft so it didn't require much chewing at all. For the service, meal, and atmosphere, I give Daikokuya 5 stars. I was lucky to find parking on the street, but there are plenty of parking structures around for $5 - $10. If you live in the area, use Lyft or the metro. The metro stop is only 2 blocks away. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you want to come here before the line forms, come before 6pm. I came around 6:30pm and waited a good 30 minutes on a Thursday night. On most nights, you will have to wait around 1 - 2 hours. This place accepts ***CASH ONLY***. This is also the perfect place to take friends or people from out of town. Afterwards, grab or drink at Far Bar next door or walk across the street and get some Mochi Ice Cream at the famous Mikawaya. Don't like Mochi Ice Cream? no cool points for you! :) ENJOY!",5
"A slightly punitive rating for the over-hype nature and long (1 hour+) wait time. Could be 2.5 stars.My order: Daikokuya ramen with small shredded pork bowl. The ramen is good- good ramen texture, flavorful soup thats not too oily, not too salty, etc. There is a good ratio of toppings- bamboo, egg, chashu, bean sprouts, green onion. The pork bowl is good too; I've come here on a separate occasion and ordered the regular size bowl. Regardless of whether you order only ramen, ramen+rice combo, or only rice, all dishes are pretty large portions and I wouldn't recommend the combo to most because you probably won't finish (but yes, it's value).Negative comments: This could be my imagination, but Daikokuya tasted better 5 years ago (or was it because there was a major ramen-craze in LA then?). There are many ramen options in Little Tokyo, of course, which are comparable in price and ramen. Daikokuya's queue is insane (typically 1 hour) and the hype is overall not worth it. If you live on the east side of LA, there is a Daikokuya in Monterey Park that typically has shorter waiting times.",2
"Waited over an hour to eat here, put our name down about 7pm, got a table around 8:20pm. Well worth the wait though! The spicy miso ramen was super delicious and the pork cutlets that came with the combo was excellent. $18 for the combo, super cheap, lots of food, and very high quality! This'll be my first stop next time I'm in Los Angeles.Ps: I was so hungry I forgot to take a pic for yelp",5
"To warm up from the cold chilly Jan 2018 weather, a hot bowl of ramen sounds good. Came in solo and sat up the counter and ordered the Spicy Sesame Vegan Ramen and taste what all the hoopla was about. I guess perhaps it's what I ordered or I got a bad batch, because the broth was tasty but nonetheless way too salty for my liking. I tried to minimize the saltiness and added sour pickled diced carrot looking condiments, but the salty was overpowering and thus inedible. Inedible to a degree that it killed my appetite and desire to order other items on the menu. This restaurant is small narrow and in my opinion on the divey side. The most popular item is the pork broth based soup ramen, but as I'm not a fan of pork, I got the vegan spicy sesame ramen, which could have been good had it not been sooo salty.Left disappointed and unimpressed, probably not returning, I can make better ramen, healthier and far less sodium...",2
"Went here to have dinner with a friend. However, she was incredibly late, so they will not seat you until your whole party is there and ready to go. However, they were super nice about it and won't forget about you while you are waiting. I'm going to start off that the food is damn good! However, the place is cramped and hot.ParkingThere is only meter parking or paid structure parking. Honestly, it's downtown LA, paying for parking is part of the culture. However, if you happen to Uber or take public transportation then you will be fine.Decor/CleanlinessThe place was cramped, little light, rundown, clutter and disorganization of furniture and it's very Japanese. Honestly, it felt like you were eating in Japan in a busy city at the local Ma/Pa ramen shop. And I love it all!FoodDamn the food is good! What I got:Homemade Gyoza - I LOVE homemade GYOZA! DAMN SO GOOD!!! You must get it! Combination Daikoku Ramen and a small tuna sashimi bowl - Honestly, combinations are the best way to go! It was a lot of food but I gobbled it all up! The Daikoku is the ramen to get! As for the tuna sashimi bowl, it was very basic and very fresh, just tuna and rice. That was probably the most simple thing I had for dinner, maybe skip out on that one if you want something more fattier. ServiceGREAT SERVICE! Very attentive and was on top of their service. Overall Experience5 Stars! The decor made you feel like you are in Japan, the food was AMAZING and the service was fabulous! Bring your friends or family for dinner or lunch in Little Tokyo. Happy Eating Everybody!",5
"I know you'd expect to come here for the ramen, and don't get me wrong, it's good - but their fried rice really outshines everything else. No one has been able to bet my dad's fried rice until now. Sorry dad!!",5
"I came at an off time, around 3-4ish, so the line wasn't that long. We waited about 30 mins and were seated at a booth. The restaurant is pretty small but it was bustling. I ordered the spicy miso and pork katsu combo. It was a lot of food, I couldn't finish all the rice. Broth was good, not really spicy enough for me, and the noods were perf. I noticed that it's very salty, a bit too much for my taste, but I've heard that the saltier it is, the more authentic??? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_not sure if that's true, but it didn't deter my determination to finish all my noodles. The service was great, nothing fancy, straight to the point. I'll definitely come again when I'm in the area! Happy slurpin'",5
"We arrived in LA starving from a long trip due to a delayed flight. I'd wanted to eat here before but long lines always deterred me before. When I saw there was no line I jumped at the chance to eat here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Had the ramen and tuna sashimi combo. The ramen broth was definitely tasty and the noodles were nice and chewy but it could have been served a bit hotter (temperature wise). The sashimi was very good by California standards, meaning you could tell it had been previously frozen by the texture but otherwise good. It came over a bed of sushi rice that I thought was very good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall solid Japanese food. Did I mention before I'm japanese-American?",4
"This is probably my favorite ramen restaurant in Los Angeles! If you're in Los Angeles and need a good ramen spot to go to THIS IS THE SPOT! workers were very friendly, the service was very fast and efficient and the food was GREAT! 10/10 would recommend to all of my friends! Especially since the prices aren't bad at all either. There are many parking structures around this restaurant too so it's very convenient but if you aren't a local you could always Uber as well. I ordered a spicy flavored ramen when I went (I don't remember the actual name) but it was the best I've ever had! I can't wait to come back and visit this ramen restaurant!",5
"First, THIS PLACE ONLY TAKES CASH AND PUTS ALL ITEMS ON ONE CHECK.I am from ATL so our Asian food is incomparable to what LA has (at least in the USA). This is my first true ramen experience. This place is delicious! I got the original Daikokuya ramen with chicken instead of pork and no side, only $13. The bowl was so big, ramen so warm, the broth so good and not greasy tasting. My only problem is the wait and how it is done. A tired worker mumbles out the number, not name so look at what number corresponds with your name, and the number of people. Are you getting this? The worker mumbled out for my group, ""Number 16 party of 7, 16 7"" That was all. During my 1.5 hour wait, I was intensely listening and could not join in my friend's conversations.",4
"This is not good. My friend and I each ordered the Daikokuya special. The egg was overcooked. There was just nothing special about the broth. Yes it's flavorful, but it felt like it came from just a big pot that kept being filled with more seasoning overtime. It was simply overrated. I studied abroad in japan last semester and was so excited to eat ""good ramen"" again when I came to LA. This was a huge disappointment. Don't waste your time and calories like we did",1
"Definitely a solid spot for ramen.Came here for lunch on a Sunday right after they opened at 11 and waited about 40 minutes, which wasn't that bad. I've waited longer for ramen in the bay area...It was just my friend and me, so we were seated at the bar. I was hoping for a table/booth, since it's easier to put your purse, jacket, etc down at a table, but it seemed like their tables were all for larger groups of 3+. It makes sense as they're a small restaurant and there isn't too much seating.I wasn't that hungry since I had a huge dinner the night before, so I was super excited to see that they offered half portions. I ordered a half portion of their Daikoku Ramen ($7.50), and my friend ordered a regular Daikoku Ramen ($11) with kotteri flavor. The Daikoku Ramen comes with tonkotsu base and has pork belly chashu, soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and a generous portion of green onions as toppings. I thought the broth had an excellent rich flavor that complemented the fattiness of the pork belly chashu very well. The noodles were thin egg noodles that were ever so slightly on the firm side. And you can't forget the marinated soft boiled egg...I only got half an egg since everything in my order was halved, but it was cooked just right. You can tell the chefs at Daikokuya really know what they're doing!!Ramen is always a quick meal. Our food came out shortly after we ordered and we gobbled it all up in a matter of minutes.Gochisousama deshita! (Thank you for the meal)",4
Overrated place for people who think long lines mean good food I feel so bad for the people who are willing to wait when the best noodle place in so cal is right next door (Marugame Monzo)I've tried Daik a couple times now and I am still waiting for that OMG moment. Its not horrible but for all the hype I expected world class. I guess since they have been around for awhile they are resting on their laurels but with the proliferation of good ramen places in random cities all over southern California now I think they need to step up their game. If there is no line then definitely stay.If there is a long line spend that same time to go next door to get your NOM NOM NOM on!,2
Damn if I don't love this place. Food. On point. The people. Rock. If you don't like this place you hate life.,5
"With over 7000 reviews, I had to come see what all the hype was all about. It's just hype. Severely disappointed with my experience within this establishment. The ramen is overrated. A little oily and the broth tasted a bit 'old'. For the number of reviews, I was expecting an orgasm with every bite. Every bite was bland and basic. Definitely no WOW factor or anything. The gyoza was bland as well. Nothing extraordinary. I'm pretty sure the sauce was what made this dish ok. There is always a long line here. Go in, write down your name and prepare to wait. Winter might come before you get seated(GOT). The bathrooms are disgusting. Walked in and out. Went elsewhere. Customer service is ok. Not bad, but not great. This restaurant makes it VERY obvious that they want their clientele in n out as fast as possible. Too much popularity/hype to be contained within such a small space. I guess little Tokyo rent is expensive. Or the owner is that cheap.(why fix what isn't broken eh?)This place is also CASH ONLY....I still don't get how a place with such popularity is cash only. Inconvenient. There are banks nearby within walking distance, but I thought we were in 2017 already? Technology please HALP! NO AC! I repeat...they have no air conditioning. I came when it was 90+ degree weather. My experience was uncomfortable. Table for two? They sat us right in front of the cooking station. Steam facial was unpleasant. Overall: don't believe the hype. Trust the locals and go to restaurants nearby.(next door) That's what I'll be doing from now on. I recommend this place to check off of your LA foodie list. Thats about it. Rip and dip and get your ramen fix elsewhere.",2
"The second of the two ramen shops I visited during my first Cali trip. Again, I can't really decide which one was the winner, since both had it's own pros and cons. Daikokuya is a ridiculously small ramen shop, which doesn't help it's immense popularity one bit. Even after getting there relatively early it had our party of 5 waiting close to an hour. Luckily Little Tokyo was right across the street so I could weeb out at the anime store while waiting. Just be sure to not be gone too long because they do a name check every once in a while to see who on the list is still physically present. I ordered the Tsukemen because I didn't want to bother asking if they could put the thick noodles in the other types of ramen. The option of thick noodles is a pro for me when compared to Shinsegumi. My first time trying Tsukemen, and the broth was indeed a lot heavier and salty compared to ordinary ramen broth, which I was told was completely normal. But the egg that was served was just way overseasoned, even more than the Tsukemen broth if I dare say. They did however do an excellent job on the Char Siu - super tender and flavorful, and charred on the side to give it that grilled taste, a lot better than Shinsegumi's lean Chinese style Char Siu.",4
"Best ramen in LA. Hands down! Super cheap &amp; delicious, especially if you love spicy ramen. Make sure to add the spicy miso bomb &amp; chili oil! Ramen perfection. The wait will be long (40+ mins) but so worth it!",5
"Is Daikokuya the best? I'm a pho girl, so far be it from me to say so (plus I haven't tried Tsujita yet). What I can tell you is that I'd take Daiko over Shin-sen-gumi any day. PS: don't be fooled by the lack of line at Mr. Ramen down the block... it's a trap! If you're committed to eating ramen, Daikokuya is worth the wait. There are a few drawbacks: always an insane wait time, cash only, pretty tight space inside, and Little Tokyo is absolute parking hell. Still, I think there are more pros that make it worth occasionally trekking over and waiting for an hour. Once you get through the line outside, you won't wait again. Service is really quick for both ordering and delivering your food - they want you OUT so they can keep that cash money flowing in, but they're definitely not rude about it. The menu is super straight-forward, so no complex sheets to fill out or numbers to remember. My favorite thing to order is the Daikoku Ramen combination with the small shredded pork bowl &amp; creamy cabbage salad. It's a ton of food, but for $13.95, it's a deal that is perfect for sharing. If you don't share, you'll probably need a gurney to carry you out. Most appetizers are just ""meh"" and the spicy miso ramen doesn't even compare to the Daikoku, so don't say I didn't warn you. Bring cash, an empty stomach, stretchy pants and a whole lot of patience. You'll be happy!",4
Omg this place was super amazing. The ramen was super tasty and came out pretty fast. I went during lunch time and got a seat quickly. Came here after being mistreated at kula revolving sushi. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The only con about this place was it was SUPER HOT INSIDE! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'm not sure if their is no ac or what. But I will wait until winter time to come back instead of summer. But this place was just fantastic and I will definitely be back,4
I came on a Wednesday around 1 pm and waited about 15 minutes. I ordered the tsukemen and the daikoku ramen. I recommend the tsukemen over the ramen and make sure to bring cash since it's a cash only place!,3
We came to LA for a mini road trip and we decided to make a ramen stop :) we waited about 45 mins for a spot here at Daikokuya. We both ordered the same soup and a side of the fried rice . Our food came out super fast but our ramen wasn't extremely warm :( my bf likes his soup hot hot so he was kind of thrown off by the hype . We had ordered the Daikoku ramen and added the kotteri flavor for a better broth ! I'm so glad we added that flavor you could really tell the soup was more richer and buttery !! Can't wait to come back ! Oh and be sure to bring CASH !!!!! They don't take cards :(,4
"Before the ramen craze there was Daikokuya.My forever love.Order:- Daikokuya ramen w.side of fried rice (seriously, I spent years not knowing about the fried rice....don't make my mistake. Sometimes I even come and just get the rice that's how good it is) * if you get the combo it comes with cabbage salad - but if you, for whatever reason, don't get the combo, you should order the small cabbage salad to start, it's like asian coleslaw)- gyoza",5
"What can I say that hasn't been said already?We arrived at approx 11:45am on a Wednesday and surprising no line at all. We were seated immediately. I don't think I've ever seen the place without a line. I ordered the ramen with the broth made from the back fat of a thousand pigs. It really was good. Oily and tasty. The noodles themselves were nicely prepared with a nice consistency. The egg was perfectly soft boiled. The food came out in 3 min. It's cash only. The servers are nice. Great spot to eat.UPDATE: 2hrs after eating the ramen, I need to use the restroom. I think it's the back fat lubrication working.",4
"This is my favorite ramen place in Little Tokyo. I recommend ordering the Daikoku Ramen + Small Pork Cutlet Bowl for $18. Both are yummy. Plus, if you can't finish all of it, you can take home the pork cutlet bowl and eat it later-- it's still good. In terms of taste, it beats Men Oh Tokushima, Shin-Sen-Gumi, and Tsujita LA Artisan Noodle Annex. However, if you don't want to wait in long lines, then you must go to Daikokuya during off hours or try Men Oh, which usually does not have much of a wait even during peak hours. If you care a lot about the cleanliness of restaurants, I would not recommend this place. It gets 2.5 Stars for cleanliness. The floors are kinda sticky, and the tables are not cleaned thoroughly. If you eat slowly, I also would not recommend this place; you'll feel rushed. Because there are lots of people waiting, the servers will continually ask you if you are done eating even though there are still a lot of noodles in your bowl. Be prepared to eat at maximum efficiency if you go here. Remember: this is not a place to chat, hang out, or sit around to digest. Eat &amp; go.",4
"Completed the ramen trifecta by a recent visit to Daikokuya: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_first was Shin-sen-gumi,second was Santouka, and now the journey is complete.I am not the greatest when it comes to rating food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's so subjective and difficult to describe taste, texture, and composition in words. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_To me, it's either pretty good or just okay. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Something outstanding is pretty rare.Also, when people rave so much about a place like Daikokuya, sometimes it's hard to factor out the hype...I.e, did I really love the food, or did I love the fact I could tell everyone on social media that I just ate said food and therefore am super cool?I thought Daikokuya's daikoku ramen with kotteri flavoring was very good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles were my favorite. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was a bit too salty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly and the pork slices were tender, yummy, and sliced just right, not too thick or too thin.Would I return? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Well, the long line is a deterrent. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For the ramen itself, I probably wouldn't go out of my way. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think I'm more of a Santouka kind of gal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But if I'm in the area, hungry, and see a very short line, why not?",4
"I've been here a few times and have even traveled hours just to make this the main purpose of my trip so I can say that daikokuya is one of my favorite tonkotsu ramen places in California. Any wait after 6pm is a drawback but you can always write your name down and go for a short walk and come by in a timely manner. The waitlists are usually 50 names long so I'd give 20-30 minutes per each vertical row, and come back to see the status. It's small inside but they serve you really fast and you're expected to leave after, rather than some situations where people hang out at their tables after a meal. Ramen wise, I HAVE to get the daikoku ramen. It has a extremely fatty and bold pork flavor that most restaurants don't bother to keep up with. To an inexperienced one, this may sound gross, but the fattier a ramen broth is, the better. I've tried original daikoku and kotteri, but decide wisely if you plan on doing anything after. Kotteri put me to sleep in the best way possible. I think kotteri has thicker noodles, and honestly I could have gone for extra if I had it alone with no rice bowl combo. I would actually prefer no combo for a kotteri ramen if you don't want to get distracted from the flavor of the broth. Corn is a good topping to contrast both ramen, and I love adding extra garlic, which is one of the condiments they offer besides pickled ginger and pepper.This place is open late, and is the perfect option for a post concert or a pre-drinking meal. Or you can also have it for no reason. It's so hard trying new places in LA because I always want to come here lol.",4
"It was my first time to have ramen in Daikokuya, also definitely my last time. Waiting was actually ok since we went there around 3pm. Ramen: soup was pretty cold as a noodle soup. The worst part was the egg! Over cooked! Can't believe it. We asked for exchange, the girl came back to tell us every egg was the same over cook for that day........What can l say?......",1
"I don't know what's the fuzz about this place ... it's good don't get me wrong, from reading all the reviews I was expecting ""A-A-Amazing"" but it was kinda like .. oh ok... I've really had wayyyy better, not sure if it was suppose to be like that but my pork was ice cold in a hot soup. The price isn't too bad, but the portion just doesn't match with that $13 price tag. And this place is cash only, they do have ATM machine if you don't have cash on you. For the wait, and the parking, isn't really worth to go all the way there for a Ramen just my personal opinion..",3
"I wouldn't say it the best ramen I ever had, but I assure you it's on my top list. The broth was incredibly creamy and flavorful. Price was very reasonable, service is quick. One thing about this place, is that it's outdated, the bathroom is a nightmare! graffiti and writings all over. If this place renovated a little definitely would be a 4.5 stars.",4
Hands down the best ramen I've ever had. And what's crazy is that I didn't even try the original pork broth one that is a staple here. I went for the vegan sesame seed flavor option and I honestly couldn't believe how much I liked it. Loved it actually. The combination of the broth with the bean sprouts and the garlic randomly tossed in with slices carrots and other veggies was absolutely insane. I couldn't stop raving about it. The spot is outdated and old as you can tell from just walking in. But none of that matters. It actually adds character because I kind of felt like I wasn't in LA. Literally felt like I was in Tokyo. Will definitely return as much as I can.,5
Yikes! Misleading popularity! The wait on a Saturday night starting at 6 was about an hour and 20 minutes. I got the vegan spicy sesame ramen from here and I was not in the least impressed. There wasn't much taste to the broth but the noodles and toppings were descent. Adding some spicy seasoning to the broth helped the taste to about 2 stars. It is about 15$ per person and definitely not worth the price. I feel like I wasted my time waiting to try this highly reviewed and popular restaurant.,2
"Daikokuya has been bookmarked in my Yelp for a while now. Yes, I was attracted to the high number of great reviews. I finally dragged my cousins/brother to come with me while I was in LA, warned them the wait would be over an hour, and anticipated having the best ramen ever. We got here a little after 6pm on a Saturday night and waited exactly an hour for a table of four. I got the spicy miso ramen and made it a combo with the pork katsu to share. Our ramen bowls came out within five minutes. We were in and out of the place in under 30 minutes.I appreciated the fast service to an extent. I could tell the staff was used to moving quickly to take your order, bring out your food, clean up (so fast that they took away my ramen bowl while I was still eating). With the crowd outside, I understood why they moved so quickly, but it made the highly anticipated experience feel rushed and not as enjoyable. Overall, the ramen was great, but I definitely set my expectations too high for Daikokuya. For the service you get and the quality of the ramen, I would have been happier skipping the line and enjoying a casual and delicious bowl of ramen at a Santouka inside a Mitsuwa Market.",4
"We gave this place a try, due to the hype. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We got the Spicy Miso ramen ($13) and Daikokuya ramen kotteri style ($12). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Spicy Miso Ramen was good but was way too salty. The Daikokuya Ramen was delicious with a rich deep flavored broth, but I prefer the tonkatsu broth at Hokkaido Ramen Santouka at Mitsuwa, which was a little sweeter and less salty and just as rich and flavorful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food came out fast (within 4 minutes). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The portions were large and came with a perfectly hard boiled egg with soft yolk center and 6-8 thin tiny strips of tender fat with barely any pork meat on them. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles were a little undercooked and chewy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They do NOT validate parking. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The waiter interrupted me with the bill before we were even halfway finished with our noodles (even though there were only 2 people standing in line), which was annoying. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They try to get everyone in and out fast, so that they can have more customers.",4
Visited one week ego and the food was lovely. I really liked this place! And very good stuff here.,5
"Really though? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I didn't have super high expectations for Daikokuya--I feel like any place where the line is that infamous simply can't live up to expectations, the majority of the time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Either it's so packed and touristy that it's become a gross dining experience, or the kitchen is so squeezed that they're not able to turn out premium product, or whatever. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So I entered with skepticism.But what I at least expected was for my broth to be served hot? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My nori to be served in actually edibly sized portions instead of shredded? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_(Perhaps this is an attempt at an artful interpretation, but frankly, it sucks. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Everything else tasted okay--the pork was on par, though nothing special, the whole egg was appreciated, the overkill of sprouts clogged my bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was fine but definitely not worth the multi-hour wait that some are claiming. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It wasn't even really worth the 20 minutes that I waited at lunchtime on Sunday, frankly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not for lukewarm broth, the mere idea of which makes me so sad that I can officially declare my extremely brief affair with Daikokuya to be very much over.",3
"Service was good. Ramen was okay. The noodles aren't fresh. Unfortunately, boyfriend got food poisoning after ordering the pork cutlet bowl. Foodies beware!",1
"I've been waiting to try Daikokuya for probably over a year by now and finally worked up the energy to wait in line on one of my trips down to SoCal this Thanksgiving break. I got there on a rainy day at around 4pm and the line was already at least an hour long. The venue is quite small, with bar seating as well as a few tables, but that probably explains why the wait is so long all the time. With such a long wait, it was convenient that the little shops of Japantown were right nearby that we could explore while we waited. This place is your typical ramen place with 2 different ramen selections, spicy miso and daikoku, as well as the tsukemen. As a party of 3, we ordered one of each. The spicy miso is likely the best option, because I felt the daikoku ramen fell very short of my expectations. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I definitely did not think the ramen here was as amazing as everyone else rates it. I still believe Tsujita is better than Daikokuya and there are many places in the Bay Area that are much better than Daikokuya with shorter wait times. Overall, it's good ramen but not as amazing as I thought it would be.",3
"So came here last night. It was a wait, but it was worth it!! Food is great and the services were so nice and friendly. And they're quick! I would definitely come back here again! Also Cash only.",5
"3.5 STARS***I've been eyeing this ramen shop for a few months now so when my friends found parking right across the street, I did what any sane person would do...ditch those kids and run to grab ramen all by my lonesome. Never mind that it was 90 degrees outside and this shop has no A/C. They already know that ramen lovers will fight the heat and use the provided hand fans to cool themselves while they slurp up delicious hot tonkatsu broth. I really enjoyed the tonkatsu broth as well as the chewiness of the noodles and the gooeyness of the egg. Unfortunately, the meat wasn't as tender as I was hoping and the texture was similar to the canned tuna I had earlier that week. While it wasn't the best ramen I've had (Izakaya Sozai in SF, wassup), it was still enjoyable. I thought I'd still be hungry after one bowl but nahhhh son, I was food coma'ed out - portions were super generous! If I ever came back with a friend, I'd probably get the combo (where you get one ramen and one other entree) and share that. If you're close by to the popular japanese plaza, cross the street and check this place out! And remember, cash only! (ATM machine available in the back but it'll charge you a fee)",3
"Before anyone gets upset with me, this review is about their teriyaki bowl and not anything else. Came here while I was on a diet that I couldn't eat pork. Their ramen has pork and is made from pork broth. So I decided to try the teriyaki bowl. Worst decision I made that night. The chicken was too soft that it grossed me out. By just touching the chicken with my chopsticks, I punctures right through it. It had a nasty smell as well and I was quickly turned off. The worst teriyaki bowl I've ever have.",1
Flying into LA for a training earlier in the day so my coworkers and I could go on a LA day adventure. Our day started with this ramen place. We came at a really off time - like 2 pm so we ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_really didn't have to worry about waiting for too long. I think there was still a 15 minute wait. I ordered the kotteri flavored ramen - soup extracted with back fat is really good. I highly suggest it. My friend got the spicy version and that was really good too. This already has the kotteri flavor in it so its really good. Protip: show up at an off time and get the kotteri flavor definitely.,4
"This place served some of the best ramen I've ever had. We chose their famous daikoku ramen and it was amazing! The broth and the meat are rich in flavor, and the noodles must be made fresh. And you really can't beat the price ($11)!We waited for around 30 minutes, but the service was so kind and the wait was worth it. The ambience feels very authentic as well. Remember to bring cash, as this is a cash only establishment!",5
Amazing ramen!!! First time coming here and it didn't disappoint! From it looks like they are always busy it's definitely worth the wait. Found out they have several locations as well. Can't wait to have it again!,5
"Loved the ramen here. We were there about 10-15 minutes before opening and there was already a line. The place is kinda small. It would be a little hard for a party more than 6 to get seated. There were 6 of us and we squeezed into a booth. I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen and shared the salad and fried rice we got with a combo. The flavor in the ramen was hearty. The pork was melt in your mouth good. The fried rice was pretty good. I like the ginger that comes with it to offset the heaviness of the rice. One of my friends described the taste of the salad like the Big Mac sauce and I would totally agree. It had a little more onion taste though. CASH ONLY! There is street parking, a couple parking lots, and a parking garage.",5
"Great ramens, ordered the spicy bowl. Wasn't very spicy. I don't believe it's worth the wait but it's definitely good. By the way, the plum wine is sweeter than moscato and almost impossible to stomach.",4
Crazy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Stayed at the hotel across the street and could not understand what the never ending crowd was about. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Signed up--waited about 30 min. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Had some great tomato vegan ramen--place is a dump--it is so busy they can never clean it up. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Many other spots up and down the street seem to be offering about the same thing-- over 7000 yelpers with over 6000 photos--way cray-- the food was good.,3
"Walking around Little Tokyo got me hella hungry, so I hit the Yelp app only to find some restaurant named Daikokuya, with like 6700 reviews. So as a Yelp Elite, I had to do the Yelp community a favor and hop on the hype and give this place a try. I probably should've found out about this place earlier because there was hella people in line and I waited at least 45 minutes, but it's all good.~ Kotteri Ramen: the Kotteri ramen is the Daikoku ramen with added soup extracted from the back fat. It's essentially a richer tonkotsu soup base. I tried the Daikoku and the Kotteri ramen and the Kotteri soup base is definitely richer and a little oilier. Boy dont even get me started on the flavor. The kurobuta pork belly chashu literally melted in my mouth. Forreal tho, I was amazed that the chashu was cooked so well I had this face the entire time O_O. These thin ramen noodles were a little chewy but was still good. Plus the boiled egg was like soft boiled, which is supposed to be a difficult skill to perfect, so shouts out the cooks in the back working their magic. This review is taking me a while to write because I keep daydreaming about how good the ramen was and getting distracted lol. I just came back from Japan too, and I could say this ramen is goooooooooood.15/10 I would come back.",5
"Ate here with the bf and a couple of friends. The wait here is always long and you cannot be seated until everyone is present (even if they're just on the phone outside ). The great thing though is if there's a long wait there are a ton of stores for you to walk to and look at as it is in Japantown. The ramen here is very good and it's actually my bf's favorite ramen restaurant. I do quite like the noodles and the broth. However, I love my spicy ramen and from what I recall, they didn't have any (I could be wrong though). My personal favorite is the garlic lobster broth at Ramen Parlor in San Mateo. I ended up ordering the tsukemen which was really good and definitely satisfied my ramen craving. If you don't know what Tsukemen is - basically imagine ramen but everything is separated. So you dip the noodles and everything else in the broth.  However, don't let my picky-ness deter you from trying it! The reviews here and my bf's high praises for this ramen spot shows that it's worth the try!",5
"i've been here twice &amp; always ordered their signature ramen---Daikoku Ramen. I've also tried their pork belly, but i wasn't a fan. it was way too sweet for my liking. i wasn't a fan of the sauce that they put on it.As for the ramen, it wasn't anything too special. Don't get me wrong...i did enjoy it, but it's not something that i'd wait in the huge line for or go crazy over. The ramen portion is pretty huge &amp; i like the fact that the broth wasn't too salty.This place is very convenient to go to especially if you're in the Little Tokyo area; which is a plus. other than that, i wouldn't go out of my way to travel here to eat ramen, unless i'm in little tokyo.",3
"My ramen addiction keeps bringing me to more tight, little spaces with long waits, and accept cash as the only form of payment. As much as I dislike not being able to pay in card (carrying cash is a pain the ass), I'll overlook it for a good bowl of ramen.We arrived for a lunch around 12 and there was already a line. So we jotted down a name on the list, and meandered around the neighborhood. After about an hour, we returned, headed inside behind the curtain, and took our seats in a booth towards the back of the restaurant. I'm assuming you might not have to wait so long if you're a single diner at the bar.$6 Gyoza - pan-fried dumplings w/ pork &amp; vegetables, made in house:A neat row of five potstickers fried into a single cohesion with a whole lot of green onions arranged on top. They're the kind of dumplings that you break up so they will detach from each other. They tasted like your typical potstickers, but very, very crunchy.$11 Daikoku Ramen w/ tonkotsu broth infused w/ house soy sauce, boiled chijire style egg noodles, kurobuta pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, sesame seeds:A hot bowl of rich, savory broth and thick, chewy noodles was set in front of me and I devoured it (after I took a bunch of pictures). The egg had a soft, creamy center that wasn't cooked too long, but not runny at all. The chashu was perfectly thick and fatty.Even though the tonkotsu broth was plenty rich already, I am still curious to try the fattier kotteri broth next time.$12 Tsukemen w/ pork broth, seared chashu, egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions:Just as delicious with the dipping broth. The soup base was saltier and thicker as tsukemen bases tend to be.Considering how popular Daikokuya (literally translates to big black family?) is and how small the restaurant is, I can see why the restaurant typically has a long wait. If you are good at planning ahead, there is probably no wait around opening time at 11am. Plus, they're open late, so that's another plus for those late-night ramen cravings.",5
Was starving after a walk through Little Tokyo and found this gem on yelp and it did not disappoint - Great ramen and great service!,5
"This is definitely one of the best ramen places I've been to. I've been here twice, and both times I got the daikoku ramen. The second time, I got the kotteri flavor (extra fat), and it definitely adds flavor to the broth. I would highly recommend it. The broth is a perfect color and flavor. Pretty much the way tonkatsu broth is supposed to be. The noodles have good consistency, not too soggy. I would give this place 5 stars, but unfortunately the second time I went the egg was overcooked and almost hard boiled. My friend got the spicy miso ramen and lucky him, his egg was perfectly soft boiled. I feel bad docking one star, but part of having a great restaurant is consistency. Nevertheless, I will definitely come back to eat here.",4
"The tonkotsu was quite good, but the wait is pretty ridiculous for what it is. I think I waited ~30 min for myself to sit at the bar at 3pm on a Friday. There was also no AC The broth was a bit too salty for me (I am actually one of those freaks that actually likes to drink the broth). The chashu was cooked perfectly and the egg was great. The noodles are very thick and I actually like mine medium but this one was super al dente (a lot of people like it that way). I like to customize my ramen so perhaps I would like shin sen gumi more. Not sure if I would come back before trying the other ramen places.",3
"CASH only! They hide this on the side of the windowpane . In plain view, but off to the side. Daikokuya ramen is $11.00 and cash only. Hardly a steal at all. At least discount it!So after waiting the forty-five minutes to eat solo , I ordered their ramen. Ingredients were pretty on point. The broth was a bit more watered down. Should have been a little bit milkier creamier which bogs down the taste. Also for eleven bucks, bamboo costs more ?Okay, but better ramen out there , especially if it's cash only!",4
Just walking around and bumped into this place. Simple and quite and the food is awesome! I love sushi and i think i ate too much that day ( ha ha ha) Tokyo town is awesome and it is also very nice at night. I like the area because it is pretty chill. I would go back.,5
Delicious ramen! We went on super bowl Sunday so only had to wait 5 min. Best vegan ramen I've ever had. Super yummy noodles. My bf got the Daikokuya ramen with recommended toppings and loved it. We got the spicy tuna roll for appetizer which was also really good. Definitely felt like we were visiting Japan for an afternoon!,5
"Anyone wondering why they have over 7,000 reviews? This place really is great! There's not much else to say. Whenever I come by here there's literally a line going out the door. This place is always packed and I guess that would be the absolute only reason I would give them 4 stars instead of 5. Everything else is really good. I dont think theres a better noodle place in all of LA. It's located downtown in the korean area by the number streets (right smack in the middle of all those big buildings). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I really like coming here",4
"Easily my favorite ramen in the L.A./OC region. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place knocks it out of the park all the time with their amazing tonkotsu-style ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork bones are simmered for hours on end to extract so much flavor that the broth becomes milky. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I actually go one more level and ask for the kotteri broth because it has even more porky goodness and richness than the house specialty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth here is well-seasoned and just unctuous. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's both rich and light...so well balanced. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles are cooked perfectly and pair so well with the char su pork, bamboo, corn, and green onions. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I always splurge and add one of their soft boiled eggs to my bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is a perfect meal on a cold day.The staff is super friendly here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They are also super efficient. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Orders are quickly taken, and if you are just getting ramen, your order comes out real quick. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've tried their gyoza here and house pickles in the past...the gyoza is passable, but I love the pickles.Some house rules, they will not seat your party unless everyone is present...make sure your ramen date is timely. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You write your own name on the clipboard and they call you when it's your turn. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is no pager or app system here...it super old school. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They also DO NOT TAKE PLASTIC, CASH ONLY. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Don't make that mistake because the nearest ATM machine isn't that convenient to this location. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You have been warned.I've found that the best time to come is late at night...30-45 minutes before closing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_That is the only time that the wait is minimal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Outside of that good luck...this place is that popular and that good.",5
"This is our favorite spot for Ramen . The wait gets long on Friday and Saturday nights but it's totally worth it. Once you sit down, you order right away and your food is served shortly after. The prices are reasonable and the taste is amazing! The decor inside is very Japan-like, making the experience even sweeter. The servers are fast and friendly.",5
"I am not much of a soup person, but whenever I have the time, and am in LA , this place is my usual go to restaurant for ramen. The place is very small, but easy to find since there are like dozens of people there waiting in line.Since I don't come here everyday, I tend to like to treat myself when I come in, so I like to order the combo, which comes with the salad and a bowl of your choice(varies in price based on your choice). You will definitely get full from it, so dont worry about the portion sizes. For the bowls, I have tried both the tuna and the poke bowl, and I would probably just go with the tuna bowl. If you want poke there are plenty of other places to get poke, so don't go for something that they don't specialize in. I suprisingly like the tuna bowl though. The tuna was fresh, and it was a nice clean dish that I could swap out from my extra savory (because I order it kotteri) soup. I like having a couple bites of one then switching to the other, kinda like a palette cleanser of sorts. The salad is also very good, dunno what the dressing is, but I really like the salad.The place is very compact, so because of that, it also gets warm fast due to the body heat. So even if its cold outside, be sure to just wear a t-shirt under the jacket, but u gonna sweat bruh. They did install a fan recently I think, but in all honesty, its like trying to fix a bullet wound with scotch tape as a bandaid...Tips:-Bring CASH!!! if you suddenly forget, there is an atm in the back, but I would say try to just go to one of the atms across the street while you are waiting to be seated. - best for groups of 4 or less, there are not big tables so if you are going to be doing a larger group, then you better send a guy in waaay early so that they can get enough tables to clear out and combine. - If you are into spicy stuff, you can ask for extra spicy oil to put into your bowl, its usually not offered at the table.",5
"Next to actually being in Japan, this place is the next best thing. And that's definitely not a slight on them. The line is usually pretty long (45 minutes to an hour), but the staff does a good job of keeping everything moving. Overall highly recommended if you're a ramen lover or just someone wanting to try something new.",5
"delicious food and amazing enviroment. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_you feel like you arent in LA ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_but whisked away to some little hole in the wall on the other side of the ocean. I only dock stars, because servers rush you to order, eat and pay, no real communication when asking about the menu, almost rude to think i can ask a question. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Dont know if they were understaffed, or if their style is just that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_either way. food is a yes, but don't go in excepting service or a full glass of water",3
"I guess the caption should say it all. Daikokuya is definitely one of the top contenders for ramen in Little Tokyo and delivers every time. I personally prefer the Daikokuya over the spicy miso as I think the broth is a bit fuller. The tonkotsu broth isn't too strong, but if you have a blander palette like I do, then it can be a bit overwhelming. Otherwise, Daikokuya is a great place to go if you end up in Little Tokyo. Just try to get here before or after the lunch or dinner rush.",5
"So there is a line for this place prob no matter what. I got here on a Tuesday at 2pm. Luckily for me, I was by myself and I got seated at the ramen bar pretty much immediately. So my recommendation for you guys trying to eat at those popular ramen spots is to just go by urself and just eat at the bar.Food-Daikoku Ramen: So this is supposed to be their signature ramen. Its the tonkotsu kind. I think it could have been creamier, but it was still really great. And supposedly if u get extra backfat then it would have been even more creamy and rich. The hard boiled egg and the noodles were top notch. I think ive had slightly better meat, but this one is def still damn good.Pork Cutlet Rice Bowl: This came because I ordered it as a combo with the ramen. I think it totals to around 16 bucks or so. It was so good, id def recommend.Overall, def a really good bowl of ramen. The serving size is pretty big too for the price. I dunno if its the best in socal, but I can see why people come back.",4
"Fast service, reasonable pricing and good food. Tried their fried rice and it was really good. They only accept cash, so make sure you have cash before you go. In general, very good place, I recommend to visit it!",4
"I LOVE it here! CASH ONLY w/an ATM machine by the restrooms.| WAIT |Although there's always a wait, it's totally worth it. In two separate occasions I was lucky to get sat right away. But on many several occasions I've waited 30+ mins.| FOOD |My go-to is the Ramen+Eel bowl combo w/a side of avocado for the eel bowl. You're missing out if you've never had a eel/unagi bowl. It's the shit y'all. Most ppl I've taken here say the Ramen is too salty but I love salt, so whateves | AMBIENCE |Just a heads up, if you sit at the bar top it will get a lil hot. Restrooms are always clean. | SERVICE |My fav part about this place is the wam bam, thank you m'am service. This place means business &amp; I love it! The staff are friendly &amp; attentive.",5
"We waited for an hour to be seated. The customer service was good. I was excited to try the famous ramen so I guess I expected the ramen to be exceptional. The Daikoku ramen was a little bit salty for my taste. The octopus balls were good, but again, not really special. Would I come back and wait an hour for it again? Probably not.",3
"My favorite ramen spot in all of LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Yes, there are a ton of ramen places throughout LA that have more creative options and are great as well, but take it from someone who's grown up in Japan: this is as close to home as it gets. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tiny, cash-only, simple menu, authentic. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait can get to be ridiculous but honestly, there's a wait because it's worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think any time between 5-9pm you're going to wait at least an hour to get in, if I go before those hours I'm usually pretty lucky and don't have to wait a while. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If it's a last minute decision to grab ramen, I'll go somewhere in my neighborhood, but when I'm craving food from home, I'll make the drive and wait the line because to me, it's worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But just know, once again, there will be a wait; it's first come, first serve, they don't take reservations.",5
"Kind of a let down.. given its hype and my friends' recommendation to try this place (sorry friends)...food was mediocre and definitely not worth the 45 min wait. Daikoku + small chicken egg rice (combo): the rice dish was sooo bland. The only notably positive part of each ramen dish is the egg. They are all perfectly cooked, like just cooked a bit longer past the runny yolk stage. But yea, other than that...this place is eh",3
"I can't believe I've forgot to review this place. In fact, I am now reviewing this place after trying ramen in Dallas, another lesser competitor in LA, Australia, and Hawaii. This is HANDS DOWN the best bowl of ramen you're gonna get.Just absolute perfection...from the perfectly flavorful and silky broth to the succulent slices of meat to the just-right egg with yolk cooked to a golden hue. And you know when a restaurant is legendary? When they serve the amazing food time after time after time. In 3 years of visiting LA numerous times, I've yet to be let down by the flavors achieved in this quaint little joint.Daikokuya, please don't ever change!",5
"One of my favorite places to have Japanese ramen. It's delicious and affordable! The only downside is the wait time. Every time I come here, I wait around an hour or longer. Also, be prepared to bring cash! They don't accept credit cards. However, they do have an ATM machine in the back.",5
"Please try the fried dumplings, they are so good ! I will for sure be coming back for them :)))",5
"I first came here more than a year ago, before I was vegan, and I remember really liking the Daikokuya ramen. So I was excited to come back when my friend told me they have two new vegan ramen options on their menu (spicy sesame ramen and tomato ramen). I thought this was cool since most other ramen places have one vegan/vegetarian option, if any. Sadly, the spicy sesame ramen wasn't great. I didn't inherit a high tolerance for spiciness from my Thai side, so I wish you could adjust the spiciness of the broth. But the waitress said it's already pre-made, and you can only make it more spicy. The level of spiciness was fine, but the black pepper flavor was too overwhelming for me. Also, for $13 ($2 more than the normal Daikokuya ramen with pork), I wish there were more vegetables or maybe tofu included in the dish.On a Sunday around noon, there were about 5 groups ahead of us on the waitlist, but it only took ~20 minutes to get our table. Once we ordered, our food came in less than 10 minutes! Also, it's cash only, but there's an ATM in the back of the store ($1.50 service fee).I might end up back here, since my boyfriend really liked the Daikokuya ramen. But I won't be ordering the spicy sesame ramen again. I'll give the tomato ramen a try next time.",3
"They're known for their Tonkotsu. So if you're coming here you're best served trying that.Ramen can be like shoes, every type of ramen fits a different kind of person. This is the more traditional style thicken curly ramen noodles in the thick fatty salty tonkotsu broth the way it should be. When i'm in the mood for this kind of ramen this is my go to place. Wait can be long during meal times and weekends.",4
"I started off with an appetizer as I ordered the Homemade Gyoza. The pan fried dumplings that were part of the Gyoza were savory, fully cooked, soft, and nutritious. The pork meat was fresh and cooked thoroughly. For the main dish, the Daikoku Ramen was edible since I was able to enjoy this dish with their homemade tender pork belly chashu, been sprouts, sesame seeds, and the Green Onions which I enjoyed the most from this meal. To complement my Ramen and Gyoza, I ordered a Sapporo Light that made the entire meal perfect which left a good impression, as I'm considering to going back to DAIKOKUYA - LITTLE TOKYO in the near future.",5
"Great ramen place in little tokyo! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Line is long but goes by pretty quickly.The original daikokuya ramen is ok, but not complex enough for me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, the kotteri (rich + backfat) ramen is one of the best in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is so heavy, smooth, and porky tasting. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got the combo set with the salmon bowl and chashu bowl, which were amazing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You should try this place for the kotteri ramen.",4
"My favorite ramen spot in Little Tokyo. Warning : it's CASH ONLY ! Also, be prepared to wait for at least an hour. I usually find street parking, I have only been there during evening hours. It's a very small place. Once you enter, put your name down and stroll around Little Tokyo. We usually go to the restaurant next door and get drinks. Before we know it, it's time to go and have ramen.Your order comes very quick! I prefer the original ramen. I Tried the spicy miso, but didn't like it. Oh and you don't have to pay extra for the egg. Most ramen places charge you for that :/Nothing beats hot delicious ramen on a rainy night.",5
Nice place. Worth the wait. Am glad it has vegetarian options but the broth was a bit on the saltier side... Would go again and try out the other option.,4
"Long wait, somewhat hard parking, but worth it?Out of the LA ramen places we've visited so far, this was the best for me. Note: Cash-only, need the whole party to be seated, and waits can easily be 40-60 minutes.Most of went with the Daikoku ramen (without the optional extra fat upgrade) - and it's definitely a great choice. The noodles are thin but definitely cooked well (and you can customize them to be even more al dente). The broth is rich (and although flavorful, doesn't compare to higher tier places). and the toppings are pretty good.If you have time to wait (or the wait isn't long), Daikokuya definitely is the best ramen place we've gone so far. Though we will continue our search for even better options in LA :)",4
"CASH ONLY. They don't accept cards! If you're a vegetarian/vegan, try the spicy sesame or tomato vegan ramen. You can also make their fried rice substitute with vegetables! Or their yakisoba. I love coming here whenever I'm in little tokyo :-)",5
Service was great! When sat every table was full and had our food served within 5-10 minutes. Open late which is a plus. Should definitely check this place out!,5
"Great ramen!! Definitely worth the wait! We almost went somewhere else, but we decided to hang in there and I am so glad we did!! Nice atmosphere, fun menu, and really great food!!! Their appetizers were also quite good, and you can't beat Little Tokyo for cool things to do/look at nearby while you wait.",4
"I had very good ramen before, so this place was pretty average to me: The egg was well done instead of running yolk; the chasu meat was pretty cold instead of being seared chasu (like at Totto Ramen in NYC) or slow cooked tender melt-in-mouth chasu (like at Orenchi Ramen in Sunnyvale CA); the broth was ok, and the noodles were also ok too.They have a crazy number of reviews probably because of their location, which is just right next to Japantown. I also had to wait quite a while everytime I came here, even when I came at 10:30 pm.They only accepts CASH only.",3
"I've been on a soup kick recently since it has been cold outside and raining a lot lately. Decided to travel to LA for some Ramen.Based on the reviews I read online, we got here 30 minutes before it opened. We were first in line until I read the cash only sign. Went to the bank across the street and came back. We ended up being 3rd in line.By the time the restaurant opened, the line was very long!We selected the bar for our seats. I just prefer sitting at the bar when I go to Japanese restaurants, I have no clue why.I ordered the gyoza to start and the Daikoku ramen with kotteri...and OMG! First the gyoza came out. It has the perfect amount of char on the dumpling. When the ramen came, the broth was soooooo rich and heavy. The noodles were perfectly cooked. The egg was really good in the broth. Don't expect to have a long meal here. This place is fast, efficient, and sooooo good! I would recommend coming when it opens and then walk around Little Tokyo after to let your food settle.",5
"Maybe I didn't order right? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'll have to blame it on that, because I walked away thinking why is this place highly rated? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I just couldn't get my finger on it....We got there, waited few minutes and reviewed the menu... and I have been reviewing their menu for weeks before heading out to LA... First, CASH only, so make sure you have it or use the ATM machine in the back to get cash. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Also, make sure you get your name down on the list.I got the Daikoku Ramen combo with Tuna Poke Bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would recommend that you bypass the Tuna Poke and just order the ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The mistake I made in ordering was that I needed to order the Kotteri flavor! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was just ok, nothing special, otherwise the ramen noodles was good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Again, make sure you order Kotteri flavor, which I'll do next time I'm in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Parking sucks, but it's downtown LA, what you gonna do!",3
"Rich, decadent and buttery broth make all the difference here at Daikokuya Little Tokyo. The Daikoku original ramen is served with thin sliced tender chashu, an delicious soft boiled egg, and warm/hearty noodles in a tonkotsu broth. Gyoza's are made in house and the salmon sashimi is worth the price as well. Despite the long wait times, cash only payment option and limited menu, Daikokuya serves the best tonkotsu ramen in LA - if you have the patience.",5
"One of my friends thinks Daikokuya is the best ramen in Little Tokyo, so I've been excited to give it a try!! It's known for notoriously long waits, but luckily for me, I didn't have that experience. My friend and I were meeting a third friend here, and he arrived ten minutes before we did and put our group on the list. You walk into the small restaurant to write your name down and then you go back outside to wait. My friend wrote us down at around 6:10pm on a Friday, and by 6:20 (when I arrived), they had a table for us. Surprisingly a very short wait! We didn't take long to decide what to eat, since we were all ordering ramen. I ordered the Daikoku ramen ""kotteri"" style, which apparently uses soup extracted from back fat (sounds great, I know). It comes with green onion, bean sprouts, a boiled egg, chashu, and bamboo shoots, along with the traditional curly ramen noodles. It was really delicious! I added some of the minced garlic and spice they had available at the tables--I really enjoyed a little kick as well as the garlic flavor. The broth was rich but not too creamy, the chashu was super tender, and the egg was great. The portions were large too; while I finished mine, I was full afterwards. The servers were precise, efficient, and attentive: they received our order, brought our food, refilled our water, and handled our check quickly. From the moment we sat down to the moment we left, the entire stop took only 30 minutes. Again, we were lucky to have come at a time that was not as busy. An important thing to note is that it is cash only. From now on if I want ramen, I will probably think of this place first.",5
"Best ramen in Los Angeles. Yes, it's fat, but in this wonderful guilty pleasure, convenient food. The meat is perfect. They also have great options for veggie. You will be delighted.",4
"This is my go-to Ramen place, especially when I have time to wait for a seat - which can vary from 30-45 minutes... but it is definitely worth the wait! Occasionally they will close down for a few weeks for their cooking staff to go to Japan, I guess to learn the ways of ramen. But I'm cool with that, especially if that means better ramen. I get the basic ramen every time - the Tonkotsu Ramen. It comes out very fast, in under 5 minutes. I'm sure 90% of the guests there order the same, so it's on constant circulation in the kitchen. This ramen is incredibly rich and the broth is velvety smooth. It's tempting to swish it around your mouth because of it's texture. It comes with a tender boiled egg (the yolk is set, but tender), pork belly (almost melts in your mouth!), sprouts, nori (seaweed), and chopped scallions. I'm glad they started to include the egg in the price - some years ago you had to order it in addition to the ramen.I just made myself hungry. TIP: ask about wait time when you jot your name down on the waiting list. From there, gauge your time and wander the shops of Little Tokyo. Restrooms: could be cleaner. Needs a bit of upkeep. Parking: Street or paid lots.",5
"The spicy miso ramen here is the standard by which you should judge others here in SoCal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is steaming hot, rich with tangy miso and just spicy enough to make you order another pint and wash it all down. The noodles are perfectly al dente, the bean sprouts crispy, the bamboo sprouts are sour and crunchy, the scallions are plentiful and strong, the pork belly is soft and tender enough to tear with your chopsticks. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The boiled egg is acceptable. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I wouldn't order the other items until you've had the spicy miso first. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_That way you'll know what to expect at least. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My main complaints are the wait, its a bit pricy (not the worst but could be better) and they only accept cash.",4
My Daughter was craving Ramen noodles and we decided to search for a top ramen restaurant in DTLA Daikokuya was on just about everyone lost of top ramen spots. The wait was only 20 minutes for our party of four. We were greeted and seated promptly. The servers arrived 2 minutes later ready to jump into action. We ordered the Spicy miso bowl - deliciousEel side order - larger and tastier than expected excellentShiso leaf fried tuna appetizer -mehShredded pork topped with eel sauce app. Great!Fried rice Awesome. Order was big enough to take home and snack on for the next two days. Fair prices and tasty dishes.We will be back!,4
It was okay for me. I expected more but it would be okay if you have had gooood ramen in Japan. Tonkotsu ramen may be good for American people. Service was good. The customer service reminded me of Japanese high-quality service back home.,3
"I arrived right during rush hour for lunch around 1230-1c and the line was long, but the wait was super short :) They have a great system here, and since it was only me, it took only about 5-10 minutes although there were about 10-15 people waiting before me. The spicy miso ramen was everything I wanted and more. The noodles were soft but with great texture, the broth was so flavorful, and the chasu was so soft, nothin like I've had before. Parking is never fun downtown, and after circling around for 10 minutes and about to give up, the stats aligned and I found a parking spot a couple blocks down on first street. This place lives up to all of the hype and I'm glad I got to try it before I leave LA next week.",5
"Probably the best ramen soup and broth I've ever had. So flavorful. Only two or three types of ramen on the menu: daikokuya ramen, spicy miso ramen, and a cold ramen dish. They also have seasonal ramen specials on flyers on the wall.We arrived around 1130 on a Friday, and there was about a half hour wait already. They open at 11 AM.Cash only. They have tables and a counter. The kitchen is in the same room as the dining area, and it gets hot on warm or hot days because the Ramen is cooking in the same room but behind a I wanted to get a look at how they cook the food but it's not so easy unless you are sitting at the right place at the counter.The restaurant is pretty small inside. Everyone is waiting outside on the sidewalk on First Street. The waitresses try to encourage you to finish and leave because of the line outside.",5
"A super iconic and famous restaurant in little tokyo! If you ever stumble across little tokyo area, I advise you check out this place and try their array of ramen!",4
Crowded. Expect a wait for one person let alone 2-5. No A/C SO ITS HOT! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The spicy miso was exactly what it said on their menu which was mildly spicy. Grab someone to let them get you chili oil. Mine was good. The lack of central air is a huge turnoff especially when being sat near the kitchen. It was super crowded so that could also be it. Either way it was ok. I'll stick to the less crowded one in Hollywood,3
"The long lines at this place intrigued me to go in and try their daikoku ramen.. whats the hype about this place? Other than waiting in line for 30 mins the ramen was extremely salty, noodles felt under cooked and broth was not hot enough.. the only thing good was the egg in the ramen.Not worth the wait in line. Will not be back.",2
"The only thing that sucks about this place, is the wait. But what else do you expect for one of THE best ramen in little Tokyo? We're usually served pretty fast, and we're usually in and out of there within 30-40 minutes. Good ramen here, and I'd also highly recommend their fried rice!! Sooo good. Also, remember to bring cash, because this place is cash only. If you do happen to forget, they have an atm in the back.",5
"Eating at Daikokuya is a necessary adventure that all aspiring ramen conoisseurs in Southern California must embark on at least once in their lives. The broth is delectable and complex with a nice hint of some type of peanut like flavor. The noodles are firm and had the right blend of consistency and chewiness. Best of all the portions here are gigantic and come with some incredible chashu pork, bamboo shoots, scallions, and an egg. Be warned that the wait times here are horrendous; i've once waited 2 hours in line on a friday night and it took another 20 minutes just to find parking. Normally I would dock a few stars for poor parking and long wait times but I found the ramen here so game changing that I just had to give it 5 stars. This place is cash only and if you aren't trying to wait in line long the best time to go is in the early afternoon from 2-5pm. This place ranks among my top 3 ramen spots in LA right up there with Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata Ramen. Do yourself a favor and eat here because it is absolutely worth the wait!",5
"The yelp reviews failed me! 7000 reviews and the ramen was not good. They are stingy on the meat, ramen noodles too under done, and too heavy on the green onions. Yakitaki was too sweet! And again covered in green onions.",2
"Food (4): The broth was amazing. I got the koterri which adds that extra back fat into the soup. And yes it makes all the difference. The meat was amazing as well. Fatty and melts in your mouth savory. Good egg. However, I prefer the firm straight noodles. The texture is much better and so is the mouth feel. This noodles were like bag ramen noodles, but less bad. It's the noodles that stops this place from being a 5.Ambiance (5): Very cool japanese decors around the the lanters, vintage ads, old tv and old fans really puts out a cool authentic ramen shop vibe to it.Price (4): Pretty reasonably priced for the quality of food I got and pretty standard with ramen prices. I'm surprise it's not a higher markup considering how famous this place it. Literally crazy lines out the door. I only got in easily cause I was one dude and on the bar area.Service (3): Quick and speedy service from food coming out to processing my check. My only problem was that it was cash only place. Was not big on that.",4
"I was told that this was a ""must-try"" while in L.A, so I guess I had really high hopes for it. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad by any means. Just not as good as I imagined it to be since some people seem to be ok waiting over an hour and a half to dine here. Luckily when we went, we only had to wait about 15 minutes. Our party of 6 and a baby was crammed into a standard sized booth though, just with a stand-alone chair pulled up to the end. We should have asked to separate, as it was quite uncomfortable. Ordered the katsu-don and ramen combo set, which was a good deal. The katsu was tasty. The ramen was good and the broth was tasty, but like I said, just not mind-blowing.",3
"I'm not really a huge ramen fan of daikokuya, but when I don't want to drive all the way to tsjuita this spot will do. Tsjuita will always be my number one bae.What Ive had so far -tsukemon (not a fan, tsjuita does it way better)-katsu (overcooked, i cut up the roof of my mouth trying to bite into it)-spicy miso (probably your best bet here! the flavor was there!)Things I will try next time-the cold shabu beef dip (a party beside me shared this appetizer and it looked pretty appetizing)",3
"The ramen here is good. Like, REALLY good. The broth, so rich and delicious! It really hits the spot. The chashu just melts in your mouth, and the egg was nicely soft boiled. The wait is long, but it's worth it. They provide magazines and manga for entertainment while you wait. Though from what I looked at of the manga, it was only in Japanese. If you're studying the language, this could be a good opportunity to study and entertain yourself while waiting! Or if your wait is really long, you could walk across the street and check out the stores at little Tokyo. Just make sure you come back in time! Also, it's cash only!",5
"Occasionally come here on special celebrations. When I come, it's always busy here which is why being served may be a little slow, but it's totally worth it! I usually order the Daikoku ramen and if it's too hot for soup, I get the beef bowl. Both dishes are flavorful! You can tell the recipes are authentic. Reminds me of the food in Japan when I use to visit my family there. It's a little out of the way from where I'm from, but there isn't many choices for Japanese food/ramen where I live.",5
Noodles are sooo good! Perfect place for 2 people. Bring cash and eat fast cuz lots of people will be waiting for tables!,4
I absolutely love this place. Best Ramen ive had by far. I travel an hour and a half just to eat here. Service is fast and staff is always happy to serve you. The only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because it's cash only.,4
"I love the ramen here. We've got the Daikokuya Ramen and the Spicy Miso. Both are rich and flavorful. The place was packed when we came here. You gotta fall in line, but don't have to wait that long. Though the phase is pretty quick, you'll have enough time to enjoy your meal! We also got takoyaki, eel rice bowl and gyoza, all are good and a must try! Will definitely come back!",5
"Went on a Sunday at around 5:30 and managed to have only a 25 minute wait so felt extremely blessed. Ramen is always so unique based on the chef and their special base sauce, so I was really impressed by daikokuyas unique flavoring. The bowl was enormous and incredibly filling for a fair price- but be warned cash only! I made the mistake of also splitting an appetizer which between the two of us we couldn't finish! If you are someone who appreciates well crafted ramen and can tell the difference between flavors of ramen, you'll love this place. Those who claim it's overhyped don't know the skill and thought that goes into making a bowl! Daikokuya is well worth a visit, just go during less crowded hours!",5
"Wow this place blew my mind. Generally I do not give 5 star but this place deserves it. Great and fast service, food was amazing. Ramen is on point and fried rice, I can't or don't want to get the taste off! It is small and very busy place so if you get sat right away, you hit the lotto. Prepare to wait 20-30 min at least but you won't regret. I highly recommend this place.",5
"I was in Little Tokyo looking for ramen, and so I had to try Daikokuya for their classic signature tonkotsu. I can see why this place is such an old favorite as the tonkotsu broth was absolutely porky and creamy, and the noodles had just enough chew. That pork belly chashu was just amazing, piling on to the pork euphoria. It's seriously melt-in-your-mouth, so soft, and rich with flavor. And they pay serious attention to soft boiling the egg, as only the outer edge of the yolk was slightly over, whereas the rest of it was perfectly soft and yolky. We also tried the kotteri broth, which they serve in a small bowl for you to add. It seems unecessary as it's pretty much just extra fat, so it doesn't really add anything different to the broth, but go for it if you're looking for even more richness.I've definitely become a fan of Daikokuya. It just seems like the perfect place for a reliable bowl of good tonkotsu ramen. Their tonkotsu is a pork-lover's dream.",5
Everything is good except the line outside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's worth the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_45 minuets is not too bad.,5
"I use to always go to Shin Sen Gumi as the best Ramen in town; however, I have to now say they have equal footing. Delicious ramen, attentive service, clean bathrooms, and clean place overall. Parking is tough to find but that's DTLA.",5
"Really torn between 3 and 4 stars. Food = really good, environment = really hot.We always wanted to eat here, but never wanted to wait in the line. This time we said ""why not""? and waited the 45 or so mins to get a table. The wait is a little harder in the 85-90 degree heat, but probably not a big deal in the winter or later at night.We were pretty excited about the food since there has always been such a long line, so we ordered a few different things: the spicy miso ramen, tsukemen (which, if you've never had it, is cold noodles with a dippable ramen sauce), and the gyoza appetizer.The gyoza came out first and it was really good. meat inside wasn't mushy and it had a great ponzu-ish sauce.On to the noodles. Both were really good. Ranked up there with some of the better ramen joints that we've been to, but the heat in the restaurant really kills the mood. It was super hot and we were sweating. Add the hot day outside, hot noodles and a really steamy, hot restaurant, and you have a appetite killer. So if you don't mind heat, the food is really good. If you don't like to be in hot restaurants, this isn't the place for you.",3
"This place is so cool! It's our first trip out to LA, and we craved some ramen. Trusted to come here to Daikokuya Little Tokyo, from the reviews, and we are so happy we did! Chicken TeriyakI was AMAZING! Our friend is vegetarian and they offered some pretty nice vegan options, she LOVED the Tomato Vegan Ramen. It's a little pricier than we expected, but the size and quality of the food is worth it! Big bowls of ramen and quick service! :)",4
"Given the extremely close proximity to work, the number of times I've been in Little Tokyo for other restaurants, AND that I've been to the Daikokuya Sawtelle location on numerous occasions, it's pretty amazing that it took me THIS long to finally come here. Ok, the super long line here doesn't help. Or the fact that it's cash only. But some out-of-town friends wanted some good food in DTLA and I only knew of one place that could fit the bill!So of course, having never been to this location before but knowing that it's delicious, I ordered the standard Daikoku Ramen to see how it stacks up against its Sawtelle location. Well, it is just as good and exactly what I expected out of Daikokuya. The noodles, broth, and pork are all top-notch, you will not find much better out there. If you want some super bomb tonkotsu ramen, this ramen bowl will certainly make you satisfied.Normally there's a pretty large amount of people outside, offputting enough to make me not want to come here. Oddly for us though, there was not much of a line on the Friday that I came here. Either way, I wasn't complaining. I'd definitely come back more often if I could avoid the long wait times.Overall, the Little Tokyo location is on par with the Sawtelle location. I only give the edge to Sawtelle simply because they take cards while Little Tokyo is cash only. Aside from that, they are both equally as good in my book for all intents and purposes.",5
"Daikokuya is just average but overhyped and inconsistent.If they had a store in Japan, they would have been just a normal ramen place you can find anywhere, definitely not something that people wait in an hour~up line for!(Yes I'm a ramen snob who have been eating ramen for my entire life in Japan and here:p)With that being said, I brought overhyped friends of mine who had never tried Daikokuya. As soon as one of them had a sip of Daikokuya ramen, she said ""it's too thin:/"" Yes, their soup is too thin for tonkotsu ramen and the broth is not rich enough. Tonkotsu ramen is all about ""thickness and richness!!""I think the soup used to be thicker though. Someone said ""kotteri"" ramen wasn't even thick enough in his review.This time they really messed up my ramen. I picked up the noodle and the whole chunk of it came up. And the egg was not soft boiled, it was a normal HARD boiled egg. The soup was warm NOT hot. Came here couple weeks ago with the bf and had the same issues.At least their ramen was better than this when Daikokuya was one of the only few good tonkotsu ramen options beside Shinsengumi back in early 2000....The fried rice and chashu bowl were pretty good.And I love their house salad dressing. Service is friendly and love their decor concept ""Nostalgic Showa-Era Japan"". If you prefer thin and non-greasy ramen then you may like it. But for me, nah.",2
The food is delicious :)) Great price.The Ramen and broth are amazing ) Fast and high-quality service. A great choice for Japanese food lovers.,4
"+ awesome interior+ walking distance from art district+ really great service+ lively atmosphere~ make sure to use the crushed garlic~ I think I like the rich soup better, but my stomach hurt cuz it was so heavy the last time~ I think I like noodles a little harder so I will probably order them extra firm next time+ I think this place deserves a 5",5
"First stop of the LA trip after the first stop (car rental place). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My sis raved about this place and brought me here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A bowl of ramen always hits the spot and brings back those memories of our youth when we made what we could from those Ramen packs and cups (sometimes you'd eat it raw depending how intoxicated you were).We got lucky when we arrived as our wait was only about 5 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The spicy ramen bowl was my go to and it had everything you could want from the egg to the pork belly to the pork/miso broth to the chopped nori that I added.It's a tiny restaurant with minimal seating making this even more exclusive. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_$$$ only, no plastic. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can tell everyone raves about this place as it's on fellow Yelpers lists.It gave me a great first impression on LA's Tokyo Town; I'm jealous that my sis and bro-in-law live in this area since they get to enjoy this at their convenience. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I told them next time I visit, we need to come here again. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And if you're in this area, you should do the same!",5
This place is amazing! Fair warning: quite a wait but it's worth every minute! Definitely try the spicy miso soup! My bf had the #1 special which was equally as great. They also make they're own dressing!,5
"Another excellent review to add to this much hyped restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't need to tell you about how great their ramen is. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just go, enjoy the sizzling hot broth of the spicy miso, and don't forget about their gyoza as an appetizer. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My only recommendation is there will be a wait for lunch or dinner but it is not as terrible as it looks. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Additionally keep in mind that there are usually 2 separate wait lines for this restaurant and the one next door so make sure you are in the right line. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For Daikokuya, there is a wait list that you can add your name to once the restaurant is open.",4
"Dont understand why this place is so overhyped maybe these people dont know how ramen in NY tastes like. I would've gave the place 3 stars but the service was terrible. When people are still eating you don't bring a check to hurry us up, on top of that they came to our table twice to try to pack our food while we were eating. This was unbelievable.",1
"Their ramen is really good however, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_stay away from the tsukemen. You literally pay $3 extra for them to separate the ingredients from the broth. The soup base wasn't extra rich and tasted just like normal soup base. Other than that, the regular ramen bowls are fantastic.",4
"I came here with my friend for late night ramen. I am from New York and there's tons of ramen joints. But I must say, it's part of my top 10 ramen places now. Food ordered:Daikokuya Ramen + Chicken Egg bowl Combo ($15)It hit the spot. The broth was really rich and the overall flavor was not overwhelming. I just wish there was more noodles or a choice for kae-dama (extra noodles).",5
"Do I really need to write a review for this place? Their ramen is just the best ramen you can get in SoCal. Period. I love the noodles. And the pork melts in your mouth. I tried both the Daikokuya ramen and the spicy miso one. Both are sublime. I also tried the ramen with kotteri I flavor, which is basically liquid bacon and oh my... food-gasm! I love the authentic Japanese vibe that the location has. And being located in Little Tokyo amplifies the oriental vibe. Staff is quick, organized and loud (typical Japanese).The only flaw of this place is the wait, which is on average longer than any other place. So try to come here far from peak times and come up with some ideas about killing some time (like going shopping in Little Tokyo) because there will be a wait no matter what. Is it worth it? DEFINITELY YES! Hands down.Parking is not a problem since there are multiple structures in the area and if you come on Sundays you can utilize the free street parking spots in the neighboring streets.",5
"We had the Vegan Spicy Ramen. It was so good!!!!! I'm not sure if the noodles are actually vegan since it's the same ones they use in the other noodles, but omg, I am glad I am not from the area or else I would be here every day. The noodles are amazing and the broth and veggies were so tasty! We also ordered Tuna sashimi which was ok, and Takoyaki! The Takoyaki was so hot and fresh and tasty. Can't wait to be back to eat here again! I also love how they haven't updated the interior. It gives it a cute vintage look. The servers are also extremely friendly and helpful. It's so authentic and worth it.",5
"Line was over an hour. Seating is very small. Parking is never to be found. The ramen was mere decent. I've had a lot better. The soup was great but very fatty. The toppings were limited and the noodles were very little compared to most. The nooodles did not taste fresh, definitely packaged. The best would be their pork, it was very fattening but in a great way! flavorful and delectable. Service was horrid, no refill on water unless asked. Their sushi was also awful, but it is a ramen shop in the first place",3
"Food: My favorite thing about this spot is the noodles..some places make the noodles too thick but these noodles are perfect size for my preference. You can also intensify the taste of your broth by asking them for kotteri flavor. Normally I only get daikokuya ramen, but I finally tried their katsu don and it had sooooo much flavor. Highly recommend it. You can get ramen+rice bowl combo.Wait: Wait is long during lunch/dinner rush but it's understandable because of limited seating. Luckily, today we came and immediately were seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Kid-friendly: last time I came with my 1-year old sister they gave us an extra bowl and plastic fork/spoon and she ate it all up :) Service: Very attentive and polite!",4
"It was barely 11:00 AM and there was already a line, but for good reason!The ramen is outstanding. You can't go wrong with Daikoku ramen and tsukemen. The pork broth with the tsukemen was so rich and smooth... I'm pretty much salivating right now as I write this review.My only ""complaint"" was that we were seated at the bar. It was so hot since we were sitting right in front of the grill. It may be their policy to just sit where available since the restaurant is small. Next time I'll definitely request to sit at a booth.The restaurant is cash only.",5
"Updated review from 2013.I came to Daikokuya again after a 4 year hiatus and I was pleased. Definitely this place has the best ramen in Little Tokyo because the noodles are like egg noodles instead of the skinny, thin noodles they have at MenOh or Shin Sen Gumi. If you prefer more chewiness in your noodles, then this is your place to be! Also, with so many other competition ramen places popping up in Little Tokyo, Daikokuya still has the best quality and taste ramen in the area. I came around 5:30pm on a weekend and the wait was literally like less than 10 minutes. We got seated fairly quickly and I ordered a half portion of the ramen and my friend got a large portion along with the rice bowl. For someone with a small appetite like me, the half portion is perfect. Be sure to come early so you won't have to wait in that ridiculous long line!",4
"This restaurant is one of my favorite spots for Ramen in Los Angeles. I do have to say plan accordingly. This place can get super packed and it's cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Decent waiting times have been after 9pm . Their bowls are big. If your starving, starving get extra noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Like Gyoza? Try their homemade Gyoza. As for types of Ramen bowls you can't go wrong. My favorite is the Daikoku Ramen. They also have a fast and friendly staff. If you can wait thirty minutes to one hour this place is a must! Come hungry!",4
"I was a bit hungry since I was in the area, and thought I would stop by. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya is great. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Came about 20 minutes early but the wait was just to long. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So if you're ok with the wait, check it out - otherwise, it is great given you go during non-busy hours",3
Oh how I miss thee daikokuya There isn't a ramen shop which compares in The Bay Area. So I recently went to japan for two weeks and daikokuya is NOT like what I had there. Still it is delicious! I always get the shredded pork rice bowl either with the combination or just on its own. Crispy potstickers are a go to as well. People seem to love the slaw they give but the dressing is way too onion heavy for me.I love their creamy pork ramen with egg!!! It is kind of heavy so it's not the best for hangovers. What I don't like about this place is the wait is ridiculous so I always come a bit before opening :) and that they are CASH only. But hey that's how you make noodles lucrative....,5
"Excellent food and service. This is not a place to go if you don't like waiting in line, as wait time is usually between 30 minutes and 1 hour. I usually order daikoku ramen which is the house speciality. Prices are good too :)",4
"Delicious but I have had ramen in a couple other places like Kosuke in Alhambra that I like better. Just what my taste buds like! But this place has good food, good service and they hussle! The line might be crazy sometimes but just pregame a bit and wait in line with some friends and the time just flies byyyyy. Or go to their other locations! Ones database not as busy!",4
"Excellent! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was worth the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ramen was sooo good, bowls were superb and the sushi was delish as well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Super fast and efficient service. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Cash only-so keep that in mind. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Kinda wish they had a full bar but that is easy to get over with the yummy food.",5
Great location in Little Tokyo. Love the atmosphere. Great menu. Ramen is fresh and blends very well with the soup. Add an egg to make your experience a little better. Place can get busy but definitely worth the wait.,5
"The wait wasn't bad at all! When you write your name down, remember the number by your name because they called us by the numbers! I came in a group of 4 and we said we'd wait for the booth over the bar which was only like 10 mins longer. Our server was super sweet and attentive. I wanted to add something to my order and she quickly made the change for me. She visited our table often to make sure everything came out great! My friends all got the daikokuya ramen with the koterri and I got the half size spicy miso with corn. OMG IT WAS SO GOOD!! The half size was perfect for me! It was so flavorful and satisfying. The chasu was by far my favorite part. It was perfectly cooked and soaked up the ramen broth ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I tried the daikokuya soup broth and I would definitely recommend if you're not a miso kind of person. Overall I loved this place and I'll definitely be coming back the next time I'm in town.",5
"Definitely one of, if not the, best ramen spot in Little Tokyo. I've been here twice and speaking as a vegan, its the best ramen I've had in the area. The place usually has a bit of a line depending on time you go however they're very good about getting people in and out without rushing you. As I mentioned before, they've got plenty of options for both meat eaters and vegetarians/vegans. My personal favorite is the spicy sesame ramen. Hope you enjoy this place as much as I did!",5
"This place is honestly OK. It is mediocre. It's highly reviewed and I've heard great things about it. But my experience here was extremely average. I've had better ramen at other places with less reviews, hell even less stars. Service is good. It gets crowded so make sure you show up with your entire party otherwise you won't get seated. I got the original daikokuya ramen with the extra fat broth. It was, like I said, OK. I'll eat it again if I was handed a bowl but I wouldn't go out of my way to pay for public parking and wait for a long time to get seated. Perhaps recipe changed?",3
"Such delicious ramen at reasonable prices! I came here with three friends and we were lucky enough to only wait for around five minutes before a table opened up for us. We each got the half portion of the Daikokuya ramen since we weren't that hungry, and it was a great portion size for a meal on the smaller size. The ramen was so so great. The broth was delicious, the pork was tender and not too fatty, and the noodles were perfect.",5
"Spicy miso ramen with a side of pork cutlet or chicken-egg is my favorite here. Although I'm not a tofu lover, their fried tofu is quite fine",5
"The ramen here was amazing! The staff was nice and the restaurant was clean. Only cons were that some of the fabric on the seats in the booths were cracked and uncomfortable to sit on (for ladies wearing short shorts/skirts) and that the table was slightly tilted. If you're planning to visit, anticipate a 10-15 minute wait time &amp; to wait outside somewhere near the entrance for your name &amp; number to be called. I definitely plan on coming here again!",4
"Been eating here for s couple decades, and if it weren't for the lines and wait I'd eat there more often. It's good what else is there to say? If you go alone you can get a seat much quicker at the bar.",5
"If carbs weren't evil, then we'd all be eating Daikokuya's ramen for every meal. It's the ultimate cheat meal, comfort food, and hangover cure.GO FOR THE NOODLES. They're the best, and I'm comparing them to other popular ramen shops both in NYC &amp; LA. The firmness can even be altered upon request; I stuck with the default firmness aka. perfect al dente bite. The spicy miso broth, pork belly, and soft-boiled egg were still good but an afterthought.It's located right across the street from the Little Tokyo Mall where you can kill time or grab dessert after (check out Cafe Dulce for amazing iced matcha lattes and donuts).",4
"What's more iconic than eating ramen in Little Tokyo?My girlfriend and I settled for Daikokuya, being the most apparent choice on Yelp. We were greeted by an entire Japanese staff and immediately seated (we luckily arrived right when they opened). We had a table next to some Japanese neon signs, stickers, and a random surfboard which provided for some unique vibes. Both of us order the Spicy Miso because that's our favorite style to order back at home. The verdict is *drum roll please* above average. The broth was good, but could of used a bit more of a kick. The meat was tasty and the egg was cooked perfectly, but it was missing that oomph. Hailing from D.C., where surprisingly there are a bunch of influential ramen spots, I've developed a certain palette for ramen. I'm specifically honing in on one restaurant in particular... Daikaya. Daikaya has a unique smoky broth and they wok fry their veggies which adds even more smoky flavor. That is the oomph Daikokuya is missing. A signature flavor! This made me appreciate the ramen joints in my area even more.While their ramen is enjoyable and well-made, they are missing a ""signature"" flavor that would truly set them apart from the rest.",4
"The ramen is yummy and the service is very fast. If you order the daikokuya ramen and want extra flavor, make sure to try it kotteri style.",5
This place is busy but way worth the wait. I check out Google and try to avoid it during peak times. The ramen is hands down the best. I love the ramen and shredded beef combo. My kids and I get it every time.,5
The food seemed like it was made with quality ingredients but I didn't like the flavor of the broth. Ramen bowls are about $13 but the portions are fairly large. We came from Orange County and most of the ramen places we try locally taste better. The wait and service was not very good at all I am a water guy and they never refilled my water. I'm,3
"Opened at 11, got in line at 10:30am... worth the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service was fast and the food was delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Had the beef bowl with came with salad and miso soup. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Husband has the ramen with salmon poke. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ordered pork cutlet appetizer. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All were great. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Come early so you don't have to wait in the crazy long lines.",5
"Wonderful delicious food, the service was great too. Highly recommend the first item in the menu",5
My favorite Ramen place by a mile. Surprisingly the vegan ramen was actually really delicious too,5
"Oh my god, the ramen here was so good! Yes, there's a wait. Yes, there's limited seating. Yes, it's cash only. No, that won't stop me from coming back. I had the vegan sesame ramen and added egg. It was so tasty and spicy to begin with, but spicier once I added a generous amount of the spice mix they provide you with. While I tried to eat the whole thing, portions are gigantic so I recommend you share. Service was very fast. I want to show everyone I know the light and take them here.",5
"DTLA visit - Salmon Sashimi over sushi rice: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The rice was lightly seasoned and perfection. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Some of the best sushi rice I've had.Spicy Miso Ramen: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ate the egg ASAP so it didn't overcook, broth not too salty which was a huge plus (Orenchi and Hokkaido Ramen Santouka are way too salty). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Broth not too spicy either (definitely prefer the spicy broth at Ippudo East Village). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles and pork were on point!Overall a solid bowl.Side Note: Came after the lunch hour so no wait =D",5
"If you want ramen, this is one of the best spots in LA. The wait is a while and may be pretty long depending on when you go, but that's because it's really THAT good! The place is pretty small, so don't expect a ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_large group to be seated right away. The main specials of the Daikoku Ramen is a must get. The beef bowl here is also pretty tasty if you're not looking for ramen when you go here. You get can get with a combination deal and it's worth it if you're very hungry!",5
"First you have to sign in inside then wait to be called, don't just line up. The place is very small and they seem very busy inside ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_but they do get the food out fast. I tried one ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_of their vegan ramen (they have 2) that had black sesame I think, it tasted good. It didn't seem particularly special. The broth was light not too heavy. Be sure to bring cash as they don't accept cards, they do have an atm inside :)",4
"This place is ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_good. Friendly service. Nice atmosphere.Very great food, great price. The Ramen is among the best.",5
"Came here for the first time after hearing about it so much.. Got there at 1045am n there was already a small line. Wasn't long but still a line... They opened their doors right at 11 am n we were seated at the bar area.. We ordered the their signature Ramen, gyoza, n veggie roll. The food came out pretty fast n the servers are on top of everything. The Ramen was delish, perfect broth n the noodles were cooks perfectly also.. I love love the egg.. It was soft boiled but not runny. The gyoza was also good.. Love the green onions n it was filled w juicy meat inside. I enjoyed everything.. From the service to the foood. I wouldn't wait 2 hrs in line for it like I heard some people do.. But I'd come here if there was a small line.",5
"This was my first visit to Daikokuya and part of my bucket list. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Knowing about the long lines to get into Daikokuya, I got there one hour before opening on a Thursday. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There was one other couple ahead of us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Others did not show up until after 10:30am.I ordered the ramen and pork cutlet combo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen was firm and the broth tasty but a bit too salty (this is my 3rd time eating in Little Tokyo) which appears to be the norm in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork cutlet was a disappointment. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was even more salty and the breading was soggy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Seemed like a dish which was too heavy in soy sauce which overwhelmed the pork.Service was prompt and friendly.Walking past the restaurant at 2pm, the lines were even longer",3
They have good combination although I wish the pork cutlet was a bit crisper. The ramen broth is amazing one of the best ramen I have ever tasted.,5
"seemed over-priced for what it was...broth, an egg, I cup noodles and an handful of scallions and 2 small slices of pork shouldn't be $13. the broth taste nice, but still...this is ramen people. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_remember Smack Ramen?",2
"If Ichiran is the best ramen in NY; Daikokuya is the best ramen in LA. Daikokuya has a significantly more porky flavour to their tonkotsu broth and the kitteri style definitely enhanced the depth and overall flavour of the ramen. In contrast, Ichiran is more on the refreshing seafood influenced tonkotsu flavor. Both are a very good representation of authentic Japanese ramen from coast to coast. I would travel all the way to LA to have Daikokuya ramen again even in the scorching heat of LA.",5
"I tried the daiko combo with the beef bowl. While the rice bowl was okay, what's great about this place is the awesome noodle texture and rich and flavorful broth. The pork melts off the chopsticks as does the egg's perfectly springboiled yolk. It's a good ramen place - now I wouldn't think waiting over an hour is worth it to be honest. There's a lot of other good ramen places in the area (e.g. shin sen gumi) so I definitely think it's best if you come here on a weekday off-hour lunch or dinner time so you don't feel like the place has been overhyped.",4
"The place was good. Had their famous ramen combo soup with a side of corn and seaweed. I ordered a beef bowl to go, nothing special just tasted like a large beef from yoshinoya. Overall who comes here for a beef owl lol. I tried.",4
"I'm very particular with how I like my ramen, and so when I heard about this place and how much people love it, I honestly expected a lot. When I finally tasted their ramen, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_it was soo perfect, if I had extra room in my stomach I wouldn't min getting a second bowl. Everything in this tiny restaurant in the heart of little Tokyo is so authentic. When I go back to la, this is one of the spots I plan on going back to. It deff lived up to my expectations and more!!!",5
"Some people hold Daikokuya in such high regard. I don't know what they're thinking. Lines out the door. 30-45 minute wait. Sub-par ramen. Forgettable broth. Daikokuya is overrated.The service was bad. Worst of all, when the ramen was served, the noodles were overcooked. They fell apart as I lifted the noodles with my chopsticks. I've been here twice and that's one time too many.",2
"My bf and I got there before they opened and there was already a line, and indication they're popular. Their house ramen is one of the best ramen I've ever had and their sliced pork belly is to die for.",5
"This place is very cool and very tasty. Be prepared for a wait, I've only ever been here at an off hour and it's still at least an hour long wait. It's a very small and very popular place.",4
"After all these years still a personal favorite of mine. In fact, my date was vegan, and she was impressed. They have a fantastic array of both hot and cold noodle dishes, two vegan options, and their entire menu can be made gluten free. I have been here three times now, and as before, I plan on returning. Would go again and try out the other option.",5
"Ramen is good. The noodle was on point and good amount of cha siu pork. The broth is not as heavy as the authentic japanese one, but still pretty flavorful. However, the egg that was not marinated and a bit overcooked. I really liked their homemade salad dressing, so delicious. The portions are very generous especially if you take the combo option, you can easily eat for two. They even have vegan options!I will not recommend going there with a party of more than four people since the place is very small. Service wise they made a mistake giving us the order of another table. Other than this, they were very polite and welcoming.",4
The service was great and the ramen is EXCELLENT. I tried their spicy sesame vegan ramen and the broth was very hearty and flavorful. They also grill the veggies before they put them on the ramen which adds great flavor. Would highly recommend it if you're in the area and looking for some great ramen.,5
The best ramen in Southern California hands down! We come all the way from the riverside county because it's that good!,5
"This place is a gem in Little Tokyo. My sis and I went on a Thursday night and they were packed. We had to sign in, waited for 20 minutes I think. We were quickly sorted once they have available table. I ordered their special ramen and the sister got tonkatsu don, which was to die for. The amount that they gave was unbelievable; I've never to-go anything at a ramen joint, but today I did!!!! The don was too overwhelming for my sister to finish, so we packed it so she could have something to snack on later.",5
"The ramen is really good, and the cost is affordable. Their appetizers are also really good, definitely one of the best ramen in the area.",5
This is THE Ramen spot in little Tokyo. It is hands down the Best Ramen I have had outside of Japan. Their broth is super rich and it doesn't need extra seasonings/sauces. Their chyasu literally melts in your mouth. Tips: Ask for the Kattori Flavor and your life will change! It is so good. The wait can be around anywhere between 1-2.5 hours depending on which day and time. This place is very tiny and CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM inside. The interior is more on vintage side and they have small ad billboards on their wall which gives you a feeling of being in a busy street in tokyo during old times. You have to be there to experience it. I always make sure to stop by this place every time I am in the area even when I am not hungry.,5
"Disappointment of a lifetime. So I had class from 7-11pm which sucks ass, but class ended early at 10pm thank the lord. Rushed over here and Cam joined me (thanks for waiting 2 hours for dinner) First off queued up and waited for more than 20-25 minutes for this. OK I get it, you hip, and you cool, understandable. Finally we get to our table, server took our orders I got the classic Daikoku Ramen. Also got a Nigori Sake cause I wanted to get lit. The Sake came and by god it's fantastic. $9. Amazing. Couldn't finish it cause Cam didn't want to help me, I did drink a lot of it though. Got to keep the bottle afterwards. Finally Ramen came and guess what I see. The Egg. AND IT'S BROKEN. My egg is broken. As if a 7 year old took a test bite out of it. The precious beauty, the thing that ties everything together, the egg that is essentially the creme of Ramen - has been destroyed. OK it wasn't complete disastrous but, regardless, it was broken. Never have I ever experienced that. C'mon! I waited essentially 40 minutes (including wait at restaurant) for this?! How dare you! You insult the sacred sanctity of Ramen! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So the ramen itself wasn't bad I have to say. The ramen noodles reminded me of the ramen noodles they served in the cafeteria in a ski Resort called Rusutsu in Sapporo. So that was pretty damn authentic. But honestly, it doesn't pack a punch. It's not as flavorful or robust as other ramen places. It's still decent I guess.Also you can't pay by card, cash only. $12 for Ramen.I don't think I've ever been this disappointed at a restaurant before.

After seeing the lines here for quiet some time we finally decided to pull the plug and go. We came around 9pm on a week day and were not troubled by a 25 min wait for 2 people. Overall I can say their Ramen is good. For the price one can not expect great but I would definitely go back. Not for a long long line but I would wait. The killer was the squid balls. In real!! Truly. Do yourself a favor and order them. The Ramen good..... the balls amazing,5
"When I was younger, I would have said this was well worth the wait, but not so sure I can say that now. If you haven't had ramen and you just want a good decent, affordable bowl of ramen with all the fixings, then yes, Daikokuya is your place. Their broth is fatty, rich and heavy, and these days, I prefer a lighter broth base. Definitely your typical rich tonkotsu broth. And that line! This isn't the largest space, so do try to come in a group no bigger than 4. 2 is probably the best so you can increase your chances of getting a seat either at the bar or in a booth. On the flip side, because it does feel like a ramen factory inside, your food does come relatively fast! Daikokuya is a safe bet, but I personally wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes to eat here when there's so many other options around in Little Tokyo. TLDR: Long wait, no matter the time or the weather, hot or cold, there will be a wait. Groups of 4 or less is probably ideal. Prices are very reasonable considering what you get in a bowl of ramen. Try if you've never had ramen and are looking for something easy on the wallet.",3
"Easily one of my favorite ramen spots! I've only ever had their classic Daikokuya ramen which is absolutely delicious. It comes with bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, a generous amount of scallions and noodles, a perfectly soft-boiled egg, and two slices of fatty chashu pork. The broth is very flavorful and not too salty at all.As for parking and wait time:I usually park at the Aiso parking structure whenever I go to Little Tokyo. It's a short walk and only a dollar an hour. No wait at 3pm on a Friday! If you're grabbing lunch/dinner at an awkward hour, come here and beat the crowd. Otherwise, I hear the wait time can be over an hour- eek.If you're a ramen enthusiast, you must try Daikokuya. And don't forget cash since it's cash only!",5
"I'd been craving ramen for the past couple of weeks now and today my bf suggested that we go to LA to find the good good. We came in around 2:30 on a Sunday and there were 12 parties ahead of us.. I knew there would probably be a wait but hollyyy. The inside seemed pretty small at first, but they could actually fit a decent amount of people in there (avoid coming in big groups though, all they have is booths and bar seating). Also, I don't think there was working AC, just fans. However, it still felt better inside than it did outside for sure. After some debating on whether we should wait or go some place else, we decided to just wait it out. It only took about 20-30 minutes, since their service was on top of it and really great at getting people in and out.I ordered the Daikoku ramen with the kotteri flavor and my bf got the spicy miso. The food came out pretty fast and I was really pleased with both flavors. Mine was a little greasy, probably due to the kotteri, but nothing unbearable. The flavor was amazing, I love creamy broths in my ramen and this one hit the mark for me completely. Also loved how the chashu wasn't super fatty like how it usually is. I'm not really a fan of fatty meats so I was super pleased with that as well. The spicy miso was pretty different from any other spicy miso I've tried, but in a good way. It had a really unique flavor, less creamy than the Daikoku, but still really wonderful. Overall, I'm really glad we decided to stay and wait. It actually didn't even seem that long because during that time, I noticed one of the CASH ONLY signs and we decided to go the Nijiya market in the Japanese Village to get cash back after finding out there was no atm. SUPER SMART IDEA if you don't want to pay the fee they'll charge you if you use their atm in the back of the store (since there's no other atms around besides citi bank). But yes, very important that it's cash only so come prepared people!! Anyways, really great food and really great service, I'll definitely be checking out the Monterey Park location soon since it's way closer for me.Also side note, the parking sucks but surprise surprise, that's LA for you. I ended up parking in the Japanese Village parking structure for $10. But then again, I'm pretty unfamiliar with the area so maybe there are better options available for parking. If you know of any, please let me know!",5
"My review might be a little biased considering I came here to eat after drinking, but everything was pretty damn good. On a Sunday night at 8:30 it was only a 20 minute wait for four people. I got the spicy miso ramen combo with ikura bowl. I devoured everything because it was so good! The only thing is I wish the noodles were more firm but other than that there was nothing to complain about. Everything came out pretty fast too. Overall would definitely come back if I was in the area and craving ramen if the wait wasn't too long!",4
"Funny shit, there are a couple of other ramen places on the same block and they were completely empty, this place, however, was packed. We wrote our names on the clipboard and waited outside for about 5 minutes, then a girl came out and enthusiastically mispronounced our names, we walked back in and ordered some stuff I mispronounced. Phonetics aside, the food was good, the place was clean and cozy and the bums outside were nice and gentle, good stuff.Oh yah, parking can be a bit of a hustle depending on what time you go, heads up!",4
I was just in Japan and had some of the most amazing Ramen. I come here and this is the first place that is comparable to actual Ramen in Japan. I wish they would open one up in other cities.,5
"I am Japanese, and I must admit that the ramen here is AS GOOD AS the ones I had back in Tokyo. Literally the BEST ramen ive ever had in the states PERIOD.Just wish the service gets better but regardless, the ramen is like 150 out of 100, so it evens out.",5
"This is an ok place.I'm comparing it to Ken ken in the Bay Area, Kizuki in Seattle and Ippudo in NYC. It's a charming, small restaurant and when we went in on a Sunday at around 11.20a - our wait was about 20 mins - not bad at all.I got the Tonkatsu ramen with a combo of rice with pork Katsu and an order of the Gyozas (for 3 of us - myself + 2 kids - this was plenty). Everything was fine. Just not as good as what I'mused to. Expected more from what has been written up as an LA Ramen institution.",3
Worth the wait.I had octopus balls to start and the Daikokuya ramen with the back fat option. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Pairing all this food with a bottle of hot sake will absolutely make your night on a cold night.Would reccomend the food here anytime.,5
Went here Christmas Eve 2017 with the wife and I can report that the food is mediocre at best. If you want some good Japanese ramen go to Torrance CA or somewhere else because it wasn't good at all imo. The gyoza was subpar as well as the sausage. The ramen isn't nasty just so-so. I must confess that I lived in Japan for many years so I'm a bit spoiled when it comes to my ramen so maybe my standards are too high but if you know good ramen you will not like it here.,2
This is a good spot for your ramen fix. I would recommend going there not too hungry if you're going at night on the weekend or else you're gonna be waiting and standing for 40 mins+ hungry. I would also recommend not getting any ramen with the extra fat either because it makes the broth too heavy and oily. It makes you feel like crap afterwards. Do always get an extra order of noodles! Can never have too much of these noodles :)You can order an extra noodle to go and put the broth you didn't finish in a to go container for an extra late night helping :),4
"Does this place need yet another review? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Nah, but here I am. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Late night, we found ourselves seeking food near-by and since Cole's kitchen had closed up, roamed on over to Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya was open, with one last table free.Though a ramen appreciator, I'm no expert slurper. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My feeble taste buds don't often distinguish precisely between pork- or chicken- based stock. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tonkotsu (pork) tends to taste richer and heavier. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Some places combine the two soups and serve as tori-paitan.Tbqh, da foodles wuz fine but nothing super special. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Best part? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just hanging with friends. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service was prompt, no issues. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Couple of us enjoyed beers. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the house Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles were kind of sparse and not particularly memorable. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Soup was extremely onion-y-- chock full of sliced scallions and minced white onion.Daikokuya has its share of Dai-hards, but I get the feeling it's kind of played out by now. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Luckily, timing worked out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If we'd encountered a line and the typical extensive wait, I would probably dock a star. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_(Hai.. I'm a fussy BEE sometimes.) ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Glad it's around, but I'd much rather get ramen and hang out at other eateries around LT.",3
"DAIKOKU RAMEN, KOTTERI:- Broth and noodles were okay, expected it to be richer since it was the kotteri style... I am curious how it would have been without the kotteri flavor.- Egg was pretty decent!- Did not come with chashu as described on the menu, disappointing!- Added nori (dried seaweed) as a topping, was surprised they came as shredded pieces as opposed to larger sheets as most ramen places doArrived before noon on Sunday so the wait was pretty short.3.5/5 but rounding down due to the MIA chashu and nothing particularly groundbreaking in terms of service and other intangible factors.",3
"This was my second ramen spot! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The first I ever went to was horrid. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Never went back to a ramen spot for a few years....Until now... and this place turned my thoughts around and I will definitely be coming back here for a 2nd, 3rd, and 4th time!!We got here at 10:45 and there was already a line!The line was so big The seats filled inside and we were first on the waiting list with 15 others behind!",5
"TLDR:Long waitCramp interiorSticky tablesDecent ramen Went with the most popular ramen here. Tonkatsu flavor was very subtle, not to my likingNoodle was good. Bowl only had two pieces of ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_bamboo.... boo. Egg and chasu was cold, not a fan of cold meat in ramen or in general; egg didn't have that runny yolk I like. Broth flavor was alright. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Meat was tender but not melt in your mouthOrdered extra chasu and they were not the same as the ones that come with the ramen (wth?) and it was cold and cut thick. Wouldn't order again. Ramen wasn't piping hot, more like warm. Ramen was cold before I finish eating and I'm not a slow eater. =\",2
Best ramen I've ever had! The spicy miso bomb makes the ramen so much more delicious. Definitely worth the long wait. Food doesn't take long to come out and they have great customer service. I am a pretty frequent customer!,5
"The wait is ridiculous, as always! Even on a weekday, my group still waited for about half an hour, but it's expected for such delicious ramen! It's CASH ONLY, so remember to bring cash with you! This restaurant isn't meant for big parties, so seating can be a little cramped and the restaurant itself is rather small as well.I recommend the Shoyu and the Spicy Miso ramen. Both are delicious! Spicy Miso's broth was savory and you can ask for it to be thick and fatty as well. The Shoyu was a little bit salty for me, but it was still good. You can do a half order for that if you feel that the regular size bowl is too big. The bowls are huge, and definitely worth the money!",4
"First time visiting Little Tokyo and saw the reviews on this place on yelp. Service is good. We waited for 1 hour but was able to walk around downtown while waiting. Inside is very small but people are in and out.We ordered the gyoza and 2 daikokuya ramen. Gyoza was good, ramen was perfect. Portions are not that big but it is very filling. It wasn't too salty and had the perfect amount of toppings. $11 for a reasonable bowl of hot ramen!!",5
The waiters were really nice. I've tried a lot of Japanese restaurants in Italy and Philippines and i must say this is the 2nd best restaurant I've ever tried. The price are affordable and worth. I experienced to eat in the sushi bar in this place. It was ok. Just the place is a bit small.,4
Ridiculously fast service. (Fastest Japanese restaurant ever. Like Chinese restaurant fast. So you are in and out.)Good food. Gyoza was pretty good. Hot green tea for $1.Cash only.Restroom could be cleaner.,4
"I've been wanting to eat here for awhile and finally had the opportunity one night after barhopping in the area. We were starving. We put our names down on the waitlist around 12:30am and they said they would still seat us! We ended up being seated a little after 1am. They close at 1am.I ordered the Daikoku Ramen and thought it was delicoius! The broth is pretty heavy, but the flavor is not too salty. The noodles were cooked perfectly. It comes with a whole egg and bamboo! Two things I love in my ramen. The meat was so tender and flavorful. I loved it.Service was good even though we were seated so late.They have small mugs of Sapporo for $2.50! I think it was Sapporo, I might be mistaken.",5
"How could I forget to write a review for Daikokuya? It was the first and only ramen shop I visited when i stopped in LA. There was a wait and we signed in. We waited about an hour. I always think lines are indicative of how the food will taste. People don't stand in line for mediocre food. While waiting, I noticed the interior looked old, but it had a traditional japanese feel to it.SPICY TUNA ROLL- avocado and tunaThis roll was very fresh and had a nice creamy texture. There was a nice hint of spice to the tuna. It was a very simple roll, but it was packed with fresh flavors.SALMON SASHIMI- raw salmon and radish shavingsThe salmon was very fresh and had a nice smooth buttery consistency. The pieces were cut very thick, which is always a plus.GYOZA- pan-fried dumplings with a mix of pork and vegetablesThe gyozas were very crispy. Just one bite into it I could tell that it was freshly made. There was an even portion and ratio of pork to vegetables. Even though it tasted homemade it lacked flavor. There was nothing special about this dish. It was just a typical dish of gyozas. It failed to wow me. Overall this dish was bland and could've used more seasoning.SLICED ROAST PORK- seared kurobuta pork belly chashu with sweet glaze and green onionsThe roast pork was very meaty and had a sweetness to it due to the glaze. I only wish that it had more fatness to it. The green onions were a nice addition because it added a little bit of a crisp and texture difference. This dish was okay. It was really heavy and the flavors were more sweet than anything.DAIKOKU RAMEN- boiled chijire style egg noodles, kurobuta pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, bean sprouts, green onions, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds infused with blended soy sauceThe ramen itself was a disappointment. I didn't like it too much. The broth was simple. I was expecting to get hit with flavor, but it was so basic. The broth was neither sweet nor savory, the cuts of chashu was very meaty and tough, and the egg was marinated nicely, but I've had better eggs elsewhere. Overall, I don't understand the hype. I give a solid 2.5 rating. The service was okay, the wait would've been worth it if the food was up to par, the establishment is a bit rundown and the food could've been better. I'll stick to Houston with this one.",3
"You know you've found the location when you see all the people waiting outside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They have a paper where you can right your name for a table right as you open the door. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We each had the Daikokuya combo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Which comes with ramen and a small portion of another dish. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen's broth is so rich and delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And their pork belly is melt in your mouth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Note: our friend ordered an extra side of pork belly, it comes to the table cold - so be sure to throw it into you broth asap to warm it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you're willing to wait it's definitely worth a try and be sure to bring cash!",5
"Best ramen I've ever had. Made the drive all the way from the valley to Little Tokyo and it was well worth it.I had the Daikoku ramen which is a tonkotsu broth, it had scallions, bean sprouts, an egg that was soft and delicious and pork which I usually am not a fan of but it was so tender it literally melted in your mouth. The ramen noodles were cooked nicely and the broth was DELICIOUS. This bowl is only $10, and I had a Sapporo for $3.50. For under $15 I had an very satisfying meal and I was so full. I came in on a Wednesday at about 8:00pm with a friend. We waited maybe 20 min max. Sat at the bar area which we didn't mind. It sucks that it's cash only so come prepared or use the ATM in the back.I can't wait to come back when I need my ramen fix. Maybe next time I'll check out a different location that is closer to home.",4
"Their current business model I believe is to mass make ramen, push business.I ordered for one, at 430pm on a weekday which meant no line for me. There were 3-4 pairs waiting to sit down.I ordered their specialty which is a tonkatsu flavored ramen. It came in 5 min and I was a little surprised. Egg: I had really high standards after seeing the best egg in Sunnyvale. The egg had a crack on the outside and I knew that was bad news. I took a bite, to find a cold, gooey center. :(Pork slices: well, I couldn't see it from the top. It was buried under a few green onion and bean sprouts. Once I picked up a part of the piece, it seemed to have been a broken piece.Noodles: good chew, cooked well.Soup: slightly sweet, probably from the green onions.Overall the base is good, especially for the price. The additives were not as I hoped.Presentation: 2/5Taste: 3/5Parking: street paid parking.",3
They have my favorite pork cutlet bowl in all of L.A Definitely the most flavorful My go to when coming,5
I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with the extra flavoring. It was really good but I felt like there was a lot of MSG in the ramen broth because after eating the noodles I needed a lot of water to cleanse the flavor out. I waited only 15 minutes in total but I don't think it would be worth it to wait any longer than 30 minutes. I would come back only if the line wasn't long! A good place to try once while you are in LA!,4
"This Daikokuya location already has 7,000+ reviews, so I don't know what else I can add to convince you to come, but I will say that it is the best ramen place I've been to (which is also a downside for me because I live almost 4 hours away and I know I'm going to crave this so bad). When I went, we waited no longer than 10 minutes which is surprisingly short compared to other reviews (I went around 10p) and it is cash only, but they do have an ATM in the back (thank goodness because we didn't have cash).The staff were quick and attentive and I love the authentic feeling of the place.Just go. So good. You won't regret it. I would show pictures but I was super hungry and didn't take any before I devoured my food Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€ºÃƒÂ§And if you're ever on your way to Fresno and happen to stop by this place, bring me food. K, thnx. Haha.",5
"Watched a vlog on YouTube about little Tokyo and it mentioned this ramen place being one of the best in LA so decided to try it out because why not...ramen is always a good idea. Coming here I was warned that the wait was long so meanwhile we went to tony moly which btw you should go for all cute Skin care and masks. Got a chicken curry bun that was outside of a bakery then went back to the ramen spot. After waiting for a few more minutes we were finally seated at the bar. Ordered right alway and was served quickly after that. The first order we got was the gyoza. It was ok. Then came the ramen. First off I ordered the spicy ramen and in their defense they did say it was mild BUT it was too mild to where I don't see the point of putting the word spicy. Keep in mind I don't handle spicy very well. Over all the noodles were really good but I have to say I had better ramen. Would I come back? Hmmmm...a weak yes But fersure I really appreciated the service, friendly service and not a long of a wait on a Easter Sunday .",3
"For starters, there was a long line outside to get a table. I immediately assumed this place carried possibly the best ramen in LA but I was wrong. The soup is just okay- not terrible but not great. We tried the gyoza and fried spicy tuna and that was good I'll admit, but other than that I wasn't crazy about the soup. I'm not sure why people rave about this spot but it didn't keep me wanting more. The bright side is that we got awesome service! The staff is super efficient, friendly and attentive. The place is clean and everyone who works there seems happy to see you, which creates a nice ambiance. For those reasons I gave it 3 stars, but try it for yourself as you may love it. Also, cash only but there's a chase and Citibank across the street.",3
"Don't get all pansy if you come here. If you come here, get the Daikoku Ramen AND get the kotteri (extra fat from the back). I tasted both the regular broth and the kotteri and the latter is so much more rich and hearty. It makes you go aahhhhh.I like that I'm paying $9.95 for a solid bowl of ramen. Every bit of it is was quality. Even the cha shu (which doesn't get a chance to warm up) was tender and noodles were bouncy. The egg was cooked slightly over soft-boiled which I actually appreciated. Sometimes I don't like the goo running into my broth.The waitlist can look daunting but the actual wait itself isn't too bad. People eat ramen pretty quickly. If you're dying, there's a Family Mart a few stores down for you to replenish your body with (drinks, food, a/c).",5
"Daikokuya, you always come through for me. We managed to be the last patrons in the door before they closed up at 1 am last Saturday night after a night of drinking in DTLA. I got the spicy miso ramen as per usual, which somehow managed to be even more delicious in my drunken ramen haze. Portions are great, prices are reasonable, and the food delivers. Love this place!",5
"This was my second time visiting Diakokuya, but my first time eating here. The 1st time I visited, diakokyua they were closed due to going back to japan without notice on yelp. It was disappointing because we made the trip to LA especially for ramen. We ended up settling for Shin-Sen-Gumi. But I digress, onto the review. After spending this past summer in japan, I will safely say I can tell the difference between good and bad ramen. Diakokyuia produces fantastic ramen, on par to what I could get back in Japan. It's not as good as Ichiran or Ippudo, but it holds its own. We were greeted with a friendly gomensesai. The broth was creamy and perfectly salted. The chashu was incredible tender and broke apart easily in my chopsticks as I tried to incorporate it somewhat into the noodles. Now, what I consider a hallmark of a good ramen shop is the egg. I have seen some places put a hardboiled egg or a non-marinated soft boiled egg, which I greatly dislike. There's nothing more satisfying than spitting your egg in two to find a nice jelly-like yolk. Daikokuya's egg was perfect.The only negatives I would say is that it is a very small establishment and the wait can be a bit long. It can be uncomfortable if it is a hot day and the line is going out of the door as it normally does. I would definitely recommend this place to any ramen-aficionados looking for a good bowl.",5
"NOM NOM NOM! Ramen at its finest! Best Ramen spot i've been to in LA/OC area. This place was packed for a Tuesday lunch. We waited about 20-30 minutes or so. The place is pretty small with limited group seating and then theres a bar for singles or doubles or any group that doesn't mind not facing each other.After we were finally seated, the server quickly took our orders. Service wasn't very phenomenal but the standard. Can't really complain.I ended up getting the Spicy Miso Ramen with extra bamboo shoot. The broth was very rich in flavor. The ramen was cooked to perfection (not soggy, not hard, just perfect al dente - is this the correct term for ramen noodle?). I asked for a side of hot chili oil so I can make my ramen spicier. It was definitely needed since spicy didn't really mean spicy in my opinion.If you happen to find yourself in Little Tokyo and want noodles, definitely check this spot out!",5
"I cannot say enough glowing things about Daikokuya. By far the best ramen I have had stateside. The line is always ridiculous but worth the wait. Don't forget to put your name on the sign-in sheet when you arrive before you start waiting. We ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen, the Daikokuya Ramen with Kotteri Flavor, and the Tsukemono (pickled vegetables). Everything was great! The tsukemono had interesting vegetables and seasoned with sesame. The Spicy Miso was the best spicy ramen broth that I've had. But man, that Kotteri Daikokuya is out of this world good! The broth has so much complexity of flavor and body. The noodles had a good chew and bounce. The soft-boiled eggs were perfectly gooey on the inside. It was absolutely fantastic.",5
"I stayed away from this place for a long time mainly because after having the Monterey Park location so many times (which isn't as good btw) I thought that it would be just whatevers..but after hearing so many people say the Little Tokyo location is better, I had to give it a try.SOOOO yummy.. I came on a weekday for lunch so there wasn't a wait.",5
"I went here since all my new workmates recommended this place and now I know why.Most of them recommended the Ramen (of course) and another person recommended the pork cutlet rice bowl, which essentially is a Katsudon. I found that to be a little salty, and I have not tried the Ramen -- YET.However, I tried the Chasu (pork belly), which is usually laid on top of a Chashu Ramen bowl, or can be enjoyed alone as an appetizer, which is what I did. (I recommend having it with other things to cut through the richness -- like rice.Oh boy... I think the world shook a little when I had a taste. I nearly wept into my hands from all that flavor and texture! Order it and have a taste and share my joy, reader.",4
"This place deserves a 3-star, but gets 2 from me. I can sum it up in 3 words - overpriced, overhyped, over-seasoned. The ramen are $12/$13 each, and they come with very little ingredients and soup. I don't know if the chashu is supposed to come in one piece or all broken up in little tiny bits.. but latter was what I got. The lines are long around the clock, i don't know why, because the taste is just mediocre. The soup is super salty - expected for ramen broths - but i almost threw up in my bowl and had to ask for some more unseasoned broth. The wait staff is friendly, but didn't bother to refill my water.. And if you have a moment to walk to the bathroom, check out the cleanliness of the kitchen... absolutely disgusting. Now that I am at the end of my review, I am really tempted to give this place just a one star... but I'll keep it for now - credits to the friendly staff.",2
"Waited over an hour, the food was not worth the wait. They rushed us to order as soon as we sat down. Ramen wasn't anything special. My noodles were under cooked. Also 9.50 for one glass of ipa?! Also you got to love the big signs everywhere stating cash only.",2
"Came around lunch, and waited maybe 10-15 minutes to be seated. I ordered the vegan sesame ramen. Honestly think it was the best vegan ramen I've had. Out of both LA and San Francisco. Vegan ramen is usually iffy. But something about this broth was just perfect, should have ordered two. I for sure plan on coming back!",5
Not worth to wait 30 min. Ramen was decent but a bit too salty. There were a lot of ramen so you will probably be full. No credit which sucks.,3
This is a must stop each time I drive from SD to LA. It so worth the wait! All the other locations do not taste the same and they do not offer the tuna sashimi bowl! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE open in San Diego!,5
"This place is highly overrated. The tonkatsu broth without koterri wasn't all that. However, the koterri version of the broth was really good. They forgot both my gf's and my char siu... When we asked them for it they brought us cold pieces. The egg was a little cool (temperature) as well. The noodles were OK, nothing special or bad. I like that they did have half portions available though. And honestly, the half portion was enough unless you can eat a lot. Don't know if this was an off day or it's normally like this.",3
First of all there's better ramen with shorter wait times at other places so make this place your last resort. The service here isn't exceptional. They forgot to serve us a few of our items we ordered and messed up the food they did remember to serve us. You kind of have to flag them down to ask for the rest of your items. They don't check up on ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_you. Seems like the waitresses are more attentive when asking for tips. They'll go out of their way to chase you down and force you to tip. The waitress with the contacts tried to make it look like we didn't pay for our food when in reality she didn't get her tip. I heard the world's smallest violin playing for her in the background. Why should I tip an incompetent waitress? Not to mention she told us to never return. She will literally harass you for her undeserved tip.,1
"23/100 Yelpoilicious 2017 Reviews challenge for Yelpthusiasm!!NOT WORTH THE WAIT! ALL HYPE!!!!!!!I came here on Saturday January 21 right after I protested in the woman's March in DTLA. I remember when they open one up in Hacienda heights and the health department shut it down, it wasn't even open a year and their ramen sucked! So putting my better judgement aside, I decided to give this place a try.There was a line so I figured this place has to be good. But all the ramen places were full but I asked a group of asian girls how good this place is, and they said it was the best! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Hmm..First off:I had to sign in and was greeted by a not so friendly host, who just dismissed when I try to ask a question. We waited 48 minutes exactly to come from outside to inside, just to sit in a small cramped space. As I sat there on the bench, I took a look at the number of people in front of us and that not so nice host, let another party (who just signed in) sit before us. We finally sat down after 62 minutes.Ambiance:Rat hole at best! Dirty tables and benches and even the lamps are falling to pieces. Look at my photos. Nothing special for a place that's consider the best!Saki:I needed a drink after these rude ass people sat me down. I order a bottle of warm saki an admittedly it was good, however it's not good enough to wait for an hour with horrible host and waitresses.Daikuko Ramen: A bowl of disappointed!PROS:~~ The broth is really good and better that the place that closed a few years ago in Hacienda heights. It's thick creamy with good flavor but they're stingy with the broth. My bowl was less than half way full and for $11.00 unexceptable!!At least the egg was good!CONS:~~FATTY PORK. The pork was really fatty with little to no meat an I was really disappointed! I had to put 90% of it on my napkin. NOODLES: They must have grabbed a handful and threw it in my bowl because there was little to get excited about or fill me up, AND THIS PLACE SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST LOL LIES!!!AND WHERE'S THE VEGGIES? This ramen suppose to come with bamboo shoots and bean sprouts, and they didn't give me none 8( They just coverd mine with green onions!!I'm sorry but if this is what people call the best, I can now see why people voted for Donald Trump. This place sucks plain and simple, sorry but it does. Horrible service, diplorable conditions, mediocre ramen equals go somewhere else! There are too many other Ramen houses to choose from that are better and you don't have to wait (2) hours for mediocracy. Better places that will appreciate and value you as a customer.",1
This place is so amazing Everytime icome in I get the same things most of the time the Ramon is amazing I am always satisfied Everytime I go in. Best shop ever,5
"This is the second Daikokuya location that I have been to, first being the Sawtelle location. I really enjoyed the Sawtelle location a lot so I figured I would give the DTLA location a shot. I enjoyed this location even more! We arrived to the restaurant 10 minutes right before they opened and there was already a line forming outside the door! We had to circle the blocks a couple of times before resorting to parking in the parking structure across the street for $8.50. I can't really complain about parking since it is DTLA and free parking spots/metered parking is limited or non existent. Due to the amount of people, we weren't sure if we were going to get seated right when it opened but we were fortunate enough to grab a small table for 2 near the door. The kind waitress took our drink order right away and came back with the menu. We ordered the Daikoko ramen combination with the small pork cutlet bowl, and a side of corn. The combination also came with a side salad. For the amount of people that were seated down the same time as us, we got our food pretty fast. The line outside the door was also forming rather quickly for a Wednesday morning. The ramen both was so rich in flavor. Probably one of my favorite ramen bowls to date. The pork cutlet bowl with egg was also delicious. The pork cutlet was a little too rough for my taste but overall still really great in flavor. The chashu pork in the ramen melted in your mouth. If LA wasn't so far from me, I would probably eat here every week if I could. Also, MOST important thing of all, this place is CASH ONLY. I know this can be a turn off for most people but they do have a small ATM machine in the back of their restaurant for all the patrons who has card only. Definitely cannot wait to come back here. Not looking forward to the line but it is definitely worth it.",5
"Great food, worth the wait. Love this place, bring cash. You'll love the ramen, I had the Spicy miso ramen, but the side dishes are amazing too.  Avoid the lunch rush. If you do catch the rush, write your name down and enjoy a conversation. The egg added to the Ramen is cooked perfect, and the broth is rich and creamy. Even though the soup will fill you up, try an appetizer because they're all full of flavor.",5
"Love their spicy ramen it's always good and even though it says spicy it's not, it's just right. Order a spicy ramen and a Sapporo and your all set.",5
Yo if you have the patience to wait in line then you should come. Stand around n talk abt how good the ramen is for a few hours. Then ull come in n sit down at this lil mom n pop place. I will do awkward things to strangers for thus ramen. Only thing is that i wished the katsu was grilled like it is at silver lake ramen.,5
"Last time I came there was at least a 45 minute wait therefore we went elsewhere. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But, I was determined we'd get in another time. We finally got in only because we got there five minutes before it opened at 11 o'clock on a Tuesday morning. There was a line of about 10 people before us! The Bento box is huge and our waitress did an amazing job packaging up my leftovers in tiny little styrofoam containers so when I opened it up it looked so beautiful you couldn't tell it was left overs. The Ramen really is good here and so plentiful and filling. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The miso just makes me sigh, it's just right. This place has that home cooked taste and feeling.After eating I was waiting out front and a little Japanese man was excitedly running around trying to get a picture in front of the restaurant by a passerbyer. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_He was so excited that he was finally here he ran up to me to show the picture of him standing in front of the restaurant. I asked him where he was from and he said, ""here!"" He reminded me of those Japanese cartoon characters that are jumping up and down and he had come to life right in front of me then he disappeared just as quickly and excitedly as he ran into the restaurant. Tiny little place that has hand drawn signs that state cash only all over the walls! It's all about the food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Get in, get out, but most importantly you gotta get in first.",5
"Slurrrpinng good Ramen, but not worth the ridiculous wait with all the excellent ramen spots in LA and little Tokyo in general. The pork cutlets were incredible though. Go during the week and you won't be disappointed.",4
"Best ramen in LA. Love this place. Great food, great price. The Ramen and broth are divine. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is always a wait but well worth it.",5
in my humble opinion~I am Japanese and a true foodie. This Ramen AND Gyoza are just not worth the hype. I seriously debate telling people this in person when passing by the constant lines. (I live in the area so I walk past often) I'm also not a fan of shinsengumi just FYI Check out MenOh and My Ramen Bar in DTLA.,1
"I wish I lived in little Tokyo so I could come here more often...I got the daikokuya ramen only, which was $11. They give you a lot of noodles, a whole egg, and 2 slices of pork. I do wish that they gave more broth (I love soup!!).The broth was delicious and flavorful (I didn't feel the need to add any garlic or chili powder), the noodles were fine (I'm not picky about texture, although my friend wished they were more chewy). I came here at 10:55 am on a weekday, and there were already a few people waiting outside! For some people that came exactly at 11, they had to wait I think waiting for ~15 minutes is fine, but anything longer and I would go somewhere else. Fortunately my friend and I were able to get seated.",5
"Authentic ramen in a little shop. This food is delicious! Cash only when I was there, so come prepared :)",4
"Absolutely fantastic ramen restaurant. Reminder: it's cash only, and you'll want to arrive early, as there can be a lengthy wait. Nonetheless, the ramen is well worth the wait, and the service here is good.The Gold Line metro stop is within walking distance as well, so you don't have to bother with driving and parking either.",5
"This is in the perspective of a recent college graduate rower.FOOD: 5/5I usually only ever get one thing here, and that's the Daikoku Ramen with kotteri. I personally feel like this is the thing to get when coming to this restaurant. They just do it so well that it is impressive. I thoroughly enjoy this dish.SERVICE: 5/5The servers are always nice and attentive. They're very quick to serve, but as a result, you kind of have to be quick to decide your order and what you want. Since the restaurant is very fast pace, it feels a little expected of the customers to match their pace too, especially since it is almost always busy.FACILITY: 3/5The restaurant is very small, but that's how they made it popular. It can get very crowded and there is almost always a wait. Expect a wait if you're coming to this restaurant--it's almost always guaranteed.VALUE: 4/5Since I first came here, they raised their prices again, but I would still happily come here for the food. Even though the food has gotten more expensive, I think it's worth it. SIDE NOTE:When coming to this restaurant, you will definitely have to wait, but when you put your name down, don't leave the restaurant. I've had it happen many times where I put my name down, go out and walk for a little bit, but come back to find out my name was called when I wasn't there. Overall: 4.25/5. Would come again, but sparingly or for a treat.",4
We decided to try this place prior to ending our shopping day in LA.You have to put your name down so they can call you when the table is ready. We only waited for 5 minutes and was seated at the bar. L chose the spicy miso with extra cha shu pork and I went for the daikoku ramen with extra cha shu pork. The noodles were a bit on the tough side but the soup was flavorful. My Daikoku soup was good. The best part was the pork. Tender and juicy! I enjoyed the spicy miso soup more when L and I traded soup. L mentioned her soup was on the salty side. It was a bit spicy to her liking also. Overall I would still recommend this place.,3
"This is the quintessential Japanese ramen joint (and trust me my Japanese grandma loves this place, and I myself have been to Japan twice). Simplicity at its finest. Been going here for over 15 years with family. Daikokuya's hearty miso broth is to die for. The soft boiled egg started my love of yolks. Yes. Do it.Unfortunately prices did go up.",5
"I came early to line up before opening time to catch first seating. It didn't take long for the line to form. The restaurant was full once the doors opened. Better than waiting an hour+ !You get a huge bowl of noodles here. The pork is nice and fatty. Broth and noodles are okay - i actually enjoyed the appetizers and side dishes more than the ramen itself. The gyoza was so crispy and was covered in a heaping pile of sliced green onions. Probably some of the best gyoza i've had. The fried rice is great and full of flavor too from all the chopped onions, pork, egg and corn.Anticipate major food coma. Completely worth it if you can avoid a long line.",4
"Miso soup smelled like wet dogs and tasted horrible. My cousin ordered pork gyoza and complained about the smell and taste. We hardly ate our food, paid our bill, and left. Never going back.",1
"Really not sure why this place is always so crowded. There are a number of ramen shops in downtown la I would go to before here. Noodles are thick, soup is really heavy",3
"Mm this place is bomb. I don't usually crave ramen but Daikokuya would be an exception. The quality of ramen is up to par with the best places I've tried and their prices are very reasonable. Food-tonkatsu ramen- yum, standard ramen but the broth is really rich and delicious. The meat is tender and I was really full by the end of it. -Oyako Don- delicious! Love how they have ramen and rice bowl combinations. Destroyed this rice bowl right away. Service-so apparently they have a policy where you need everyone to be seated. Someone in our party was running late and this fobby looking female waiter was making a big deal out of it. Luckily, this other guy who was a lot more chill let us stay and took our orders. Besides that, service is fine. Environment- super crowded and there's not much seating. Not the best place for large parties and expect to wait during busy times. Overall, this is one of the top ramen places I've tried. I def recommend it to anyone in the area or wants to try places in LA!",5
"I love this place in Little Tokyo for ramen. However it's not really a quick bite because there's almost always a long wait. The best suggestion would be to come hungry, put your name on the list, and get some mocha from the shop next door to snack on. The standard ramen bowl is pretty good, not spicy but tasty and I like it even though I usually don't eat ramen unless it is super spicy. The portion size is good too: filling and enough that you are full but don't feel bad about wasting any",4
"Delicious spicy miso ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Had it with corn, butter, and extra egg just how I like it. Wait was around 15 minutes at 11pm on a Thursday. Will definitely return.",4
"It was a long wait. Signed up then popped 2 doors down to Marugame Monza and had their hand made Uni cream Udon. Finished that and popped back here just in time for the ramen. Hehe.It was past 10 p.m. on a week night. Would I wait for 45 minutes or longer for it again? No. It was good but not outstanding, but it was very comparable to Shinshengumi. Not sure I have found the 5 stars ramen yet. But this was intriguing since it always had a long line outside, over 6,600 reviews for a hole in the proverbial wall, wtf? This was the only opportune time to try it. :)",4
"Best udon I have ever had! Really great service and really great ambience, and the food is spectacular! They have really great pescatarian options, all of their soups are fish broth based which I like, they also have a vegan option I believe, but better to call to confirm. Went there multiple times with family and friends. The wait is long though it is worth it because they are a great place!",5
"Cash Only!Got here around 3pm, and even so, there was a 30 minute wait for my boyfriend and I. I was glad to be able to sit down in that timeframe as we had our flight to catch that evening and I wanted to eat here from all the raves i heard.The dishes come out so quickly which is really nice! I ordered the spicy miso ramen and my boyfriend ordered the traditional tonkotsu. Both were so delicious and rich in flavor. I wish the pork belly slice was a bit thicker, but still tasted great. I love the ajitsuki eggs.It's really a dine in, and get out type of restaurant as it's a really popular place and they want to serve as many people as possible. Definitely one of my favorites",5
"This place is always packed. After a 2 hour wait, my expectations were high. This place does not disappoint.I tried the Daikokuya Ramen special. The secret soy sauce makes all the difference from other ramen places. The pork belly and the ramen was devine. I can eat here all the time.Service was quick. Expect to wait a while on a busy weekend night. Highly recommend this place.",4
This place has one of the best ramens I've ever tried! The service is fast but people are not really there to help because it is always so busy. The food is absolutely worth the wait!!,4
"Very nice place! My boyfriend and I are ramen connoisseurs back home in NYC so when we went out for a trip in California, naturally we had to try what is labeled as ""the best ramen in LA"". Man, I was not disappointed at all. The wait was about 30 minutes which was expected for a small ramen shop on a Friday night, and I definitely say it was worth the wait. While you browse the menu and wait to order, you're served a really light and refreshing shredded salad, with dressing made by the restaurant. The sauce is super creamy and delicious, and they even have it bottled and for sale! Very smart on their end. We ordered the Daikokuya ramen which was such a joy for my tastebuds, and our meal was served by a waiter who sang our order out to us. Pretty enjoyable experience, I'll be sure to be back the next time I'm in LA!",4
I haven't been here in ages and the lines are so long but my friend wanted to go so we went early and still had to wait for 40 min. Yeah. It's what I remember. I was underwhelmed. I don't know why people like it so much the broth was oily and not a lot of flavor. I was expecting more with the spicy miso broth. The noodles were good and chewy but not enough to change my rating. I don't think I will wait in line again.,3
Not worth the wait. Broth is a bit too salty and the extra port we ordered seemed to be frozen. The egg also had a weird texture. It's like they froze it and heated it up.,2
"The food is great, but there are equally great ramen places without the long wait. I guess it just didn't match up to my expectations. The broth and noodles were delicious and tasty, but it wasn't a memorable experience. I finished the dinner and left Little Tokyo with the time spent waiting for the food as being more memorable than the actual food itself. With its popularity, I somehow expected to be more impressed.This ramen place is still pretty good, just not worth the long wait times. I would definitely come back if there was only a short wait because the wait was really off-putting. There are other great ramen places around.",4
"This is what ramen dreams are made of. We got here and put our names on the list. We killed 20 minutes or so. By the time we got back there were still 10 or so people ahead of us, but they asked for a party of 2 and we were the first ones available! we sat down and ordered and within 5 minutes they brought us the gyoza appetizer that we had ordered. Shortly after the ramen came out. I got the kotteri flavor daikou and added an order of pork belly. My girlfriend got the spicy miso with the recommended corn and butter. Both were packed with flavor and were phenomenal. The spicy wasn't too spicy, like some places I've been have made it. All in all great ramen, and highly recommended.",5
"Wow. Best ramen I have ever had!!!The regular and spicy ramen tasted very authentic with the perfect amount of ingredients. The salad and fried rice was nothing like l have ever tasted. The service was great, very attentive, and friendly!The restroons were clean and non stinky.I am definitely coming back here.",5
They have vegan ramen so I love it already! It tasted as good as regular ramen and they serve you a huge bowl. Tiny place with awesome food. Definitely worth the wait. The employees are really nice. Great service. I'll definitely come back.,5
this place is has the best ramen bowls out there. I always keep coming back and even though parking may be an ass its SO WORTH IT! The lines are usually long and might take over thirty minutes or more depending on the time and the day you usually go. What you are suppose to do is sign on the guest list and write your name and then how much people is in your party. then after that I just time out thirty minutes then I just walk across to Little Tokyo and waste my time there. The service is usually really quick and they are always on their feet all the time. They are really nice and they bring out the food usually in like 3-5 minutes. I highly recommend this place for people who love noodles or ramen. IF THEY HAVEN'T TRIED THIS PLACE THEY HAVEN'T TRIED REAL RAMEN!!!,5
"Happen to be in a workshop very close to this place and I remember last time I could not eat here due to a very long waiting line (and smoky). So this time I have to get their famous ramen. Yummmmmm, it is worth the walking distance (10 mins but I hate walking in downtown LA). The house ramen is so good, flavor even without their recommend addition sauce. A bit off with one of the waitress, but overall I am happy today :)",5
"Good customer service but the food was over priced and so not worth it. The fried food could of been presented better but it was oily as hell, they could of drenched the oil prior to plating. Beef bowl tasted like it was from Yoshiniya and just plated on a nice bowl! I can't even with this place so disappointed!! Kia Ramen is so much more better!!",1
"Arrived at 1PM expecting a wait, but got lucky and seated almost immediately. Dove right into some interesting bonito-infused gyoza and had to try the tsukemen. It was just so warm in there, going full bore on their ramen seemed like a sweaty proposition.The tsukemen was pretty satisfying; the noodles were great. The egg was just right with the yolk still soft. The pork slices broke apart easily, perhaps a bit too tender. The broth was good, but it did leave me with a bit of a lingering salty aftertaste. Fortunately, not one of those dreaded MSG hangovers, just slightly unpleasant feeling for a couple hours. Worth it though, IMO.When I was just about ready to pay the bill and head out, the herd of patrons showed up. Quite a few folks suddenly waiting for tables. The influx made paying the bill and getting change a bit slow, but can't really complain.",3
"Cash only and worth every penny! Hits the spot when you're craving ramen/noodles. And they have veggie broth for the non meat/pork eaters. They also have other options of entrees besides noodles, such as beef and rice, fried rice, etc. I got the Daikokuya Ramen classic noodle bowl which was perfect noodle size and soup texture. The amount of noodles and soup in one bowl is pretty filling. I had leftovers. Would recommend this place!",5
"So we waited like 45 mins to sit. It was 2pm. I thought it is worth the wait because there so much reviews. There's nothing special. But the ramen is good. They have marinated egg. Service is fast. There is only one size i think. I ordered the daikokuya specialty for 12. To be honest the MSG is too much i have to stop in the middle as i started to feel sick. I am a culinarian and very sensitive to MSG. They have a no msg vegetarian ramen but that is not what i want. I swear i didn't finish my ramen. The soup is still half the bowl and i wasted it as i wanna go home and go to bed. Headache and lightheaded means MSG kicked in. I drank 3 glasses of water. It is not worth the wait. The place is too small that is why the line is long. I will not come back. In my own opinion, since the ramen house has a lot of regulars and continue supporting the business i think it is better to give something back. Give them some comfort. Renovate to a bigger place. Without the regulars, your business will be closed. That is how we keep business. Again, just my own opinion. The kitchen to restroom is soo filthy i suggest not going to restroom before eating. You will lose your appetite.",2
"Cash only and the line is always long, but for a good reason!!! So good it's definitely in my top 5, but there are also ramen places within the general vicinity if you don't want to wait.",4
Server never brought me change. I would like to choose how much I tip. The server took the cash and then wasn't seen again. I waited about 10 min but then had to leave because my parking was up. Ramen was definitely delicious. Just bring small bills when coming here.,4
Had the sesame vegan ramen with egg noodles. Everything about it was delicious! It's a tiny place so expect to wait to be seated.,5
"To start.... Once you get there, there's a clipboard with a sign-in sheet. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You write your name next to the following number, # of people in your party, and write ""yes"" or ""no"" if your group is willing to be separated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just fyi, the larger your party, the longer you may be waiting for a table. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_What I don't like is that as they call out the next number or name of person on the list and if they aren't there, they will go back to the skipped ones later just when you think you are next on the list. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_In my opinion, if you aren't there as they call out your name, it should be crossed off as a no show. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There are tons of people waiting around for their name to be called. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There were four of us in our group and we wanted to be seated together. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So, after waiting a little more than an hour for a table, we finally got seated at the bar.So about the food.... We each ordered their most popular ramen dish, the Daikoku. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Me and one of my friends shared one bowl of it ($14), but ordered extra noodles on the side (extra $2.50). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was the perfect amount for us, especially when we wanted to get dessert somewhere else right after. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was delicious and the slow cooked pork belly was so tender and pretty much melted in my mouth. And by the way, I am normally not a pork belly person, but this was quite tasty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles already in the bowl were really good. So, the extra noodles weren't as flavorful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It would've been better if it was marinating in the broth for awhile. We also had the pork gyoza, which was a perfect appetizer for our ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I liked the extra green onions on top, too. All in all, the wait is worth the wait especially if you wanted to have a taste of the ""original"" noodles.",4
This was our best meal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was a relaxed quiet atmosphere unlike many of the restaurants on this area. All of our food and drinks were excellent and we had a great time here. Highly recommended.,5
My favorite late night Ramen place in LA! Order their Daikoku Ramen with the miso bomb!,5
"""Waitress Dumped My To-Go Food. I Was Sad.""Customer Service::Two-stars is for the waitress there... After I finished the ramen and PAID... I had a bowl of pork chop rice bowl and takoyaki leftover... the waitress asked me if I want them to be packed for takeout... I said yes! She took them into the kitchen and packed for me... ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, i was out the door coz I had received a emergency call ... only ONE minute (seriously) after i came back and asked the waitress for my takeout food... She said she dumped it.... what a waste!!!? I had 3 years of experience working in a restaurant... i won't do such a thing if my customers ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_just disappear... at least I would keep the togo food for 15 minutes to see if he or she would come back or not right??? The Food::Ramen is not extremely good here... I would say it is decent... But you need to drink lots of water afterwards. Waited for two hours and I DONT think it worth the wait...",2
"Came here base on the high reviews. I'm not disappointed, excellent ramen place, very flavorful and good. Long waiting, about an hour wait, but worth it, very small place so that's why it took so long. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall, good big size portion, lots of meats included and just good! Recommended",5
"Overrated - Its A-OK doe; with so many Ramen places in LA now I can't justify the wait on peak times. That being said, go at off hours like 4:30 or 11:15 and you'll be fine. The place next door is pretty damn good though ""Marugame"" I was a little disappointed; because it wasn't as flavorful as other fatty broth and you basically get 2 pieces of thinly sliced pork for 11 dollars. If there's a long wait, there's another ramen place like 4 blocks down and one accross the street (Maruya - which has the opposite problem of giving too much meat!)",3
I won't review this since there's so many reviews here but it was really good. Simple and hefty and quick service. **CASH ONLY** luckily there's banks and atms around. Be prepared for long lines (could be a smidge cleaner too) but definitely a must try in the area.,4
Awesome ramen and great service. We have also enjoyed their Sawtelle location. Add a bit of the garlic paste and ginger ... on the table.,5
"What can I say? Hands down one of the BEST ramen places in town. Had the Daikokuya ramen with katsu bowl combo. Enormous portions, incredible flavor, and as good as the ramen in Japan. This is an old school joint that is cash only and you may find yourself waiting a while to get a seat. But it's worth it. Too many classic restaurants in L.A. try to capitalize on being kitsch and overcharge because they're popular (think Apple Pan, Phillipe's, etc.). But this place remains true to form. Incredible ramen at a great price.",5
"One of the most well known ramenya in LA, Daikokuya maintains its reputation for good reason. Their noodles, pork, egg, and broth are consistently top quality, and despite the small building size and somewhat cramped seating, this is more than made up for in the quality of food. I have only had Daikokuya twice, but both times were amazing experiences for me. I also tried the gyoza my most recent time - the dumplings were quite tasty and juicy, and tasted homemade rather than store bought and reheated.Daikokuya is one of the premier institutions of ramen in the Los Angeles area, and it is a must try location for anyone visiting the city.",5
"Mmmm the Hot Dumps.What Gyoza around comes around.Salad dressing is too bomb!Hands down the Spicy Miso was Lit AF!!!Got so stuffed. Couldn't eat my side bowl.Pro Tip: If the wait bothers u just put ur name down and grab some brew at far bar, set ur time for 5 mines for every party ahead of u.Bathroom is basic. Toilet paper is decent.",5
This is a life-changing experience to have the best Ramen in the world in Los Angeles! Come and enjoy the hot Spicy miso along with the freshly made gyoza and an ice cold beer! This place is unmatched unlike any other Ramen house I've been to! Come enjoy cheers,5
"Best ramen ever! My best friend and I went to San Francisco this past summer and had top notch ramen; we were not sure if we would find one similar or better. But this place is the best ever. The noodles were absolutely perfect; you can taste the broth with every bite. The pork was soft, would fall apart when picking it up with chopsticks, and had excellent flavor. The staff was also really sweet and nice. There is a wait but it's so worth it.",5
"I ordered their known speciality Daikoku ramen for $9.95 and it was just ok to me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The place is just way too small and the wait in line is just going to forever be there since it's popular and well-known. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You must put in your name and number of people in your groupie. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A party of 4 would be your biggest groupie you could dine with. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Our groupie waited for about 45 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I guess it feels like Japan - super crowded and a lot of hustling and bustling going on. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You just have to eat and jet and no time to jibber jabber about your yacht life. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A few tables and booths and a tiny bar fill up some square footage. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Be careful walking to the restroom because you can easily slip on that slippery tile. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Daikoku ramen is a tonkatsu soup base (what they are known for) filled with bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, green onions, a soft boiled egg, and 2 slices of kurobuta pork belly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The soup base was good, but not the best I've ever had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The egg white texture was too soft for my liking. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork belly felt like it was way too crumbly versus tender for a pork belly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It lost some of that rich flavor and texture because it was sitting too long in water kind of feeling. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The same feeling like your skin turning wrinkly from sitting in the pool for too long. However, the egg noodles were cooked to a perfect firmness. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My expectations were too high, but I'm glad I was able to try it at least once. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It wasn't too bad, but not the best. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Check please. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Going to yacht it up.",3
"You literally can't go wrong here EVER. If you're looking for a heavier, thicker and fattier broth, your search ends here. Best ramen in SoCal in my opinion--and I'm a ramen fanatic. I've brought other friends who also love ramen and they said this is the best ramen they've ever had.. I brought a talkative friend who normally talks through meals, who stayed quiet throughout the entire meal because they were enjoying the ramen so much--yeah, that's how good it was to them lmao. It's one of those ramen places you just want to concentrate on the flavor of how bomb it is to yourself. I always get the Daikokuya ramen combo with pork cutlet and my friend got the other pork dish which they're well known for. Perfect noodle texture, perfect soup, soft char siu and perfectly soft-boiled egg plssThe service is great considering how busy it is.I wouldn't come to this location ever again though--because of the long wait. There is another location open in Hollywood I like to go to with the same quality of food but never a wait. And there is parking there too as long as you tip valet lol.. If however, you do decide to come to this location since you can just put your name on the list and walk around little tokyo to kill time, I'd make sure to put an alarm to come back around the estimated time and go INSIDE the job to wait because the server doesn't go outside to call your party's name. She stays inside.",5
"I was refused service! My boyfriend and I were stuck in traffic trying to meet our friends for dinner. They started eating because we were so late. Once we got there, our friends were just about finished and we wanted to order food. The waitress said they cannot serve me because we did not get there the same time as our friends. I only wanted one bowl of ramen and she refused to serve me. We asked politely and she started getting attitude with us. (So we ended up leaving and having FAR BAR just down the street and it was so much better! There was an intimate outdoor seating area. The food and beer was super tasty. Highly recommend Far Bar)I have never had such rude service especially with a place that has so many great reviews. Also the cash only policy was annoying. It's 2017, everyone uses card now",1
"Spicy ramen was good, but the crab fried rice was the best thing! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Extremely flavorful and a little crunchy.",4
"Found this place after searching through Yelp for some good eats near my hotel while on business in LA. This spot was highly rated and I wanted to give it a try. Luckily for my coworker and I, we arrived early (about 6:30ish) for dinner. We put our names in and waited all of 15 minutes, if that. It's a small restaurant with a few seats; hence, the reviews regarding long wait times. It is also cash only, but they, conveniently, have an ATM located at the back of the restaurant. We were seated at a tiny table and were greeted immediately. The service is fast and food is turned out quickly as well. I ordered the daikoku ramen and small chicken. Each combination ramen order is also served with a side of soup and salad. I totally didn't pay attention to that fact because, with the combination ramen that I ordered, it was a ton of food! Everything was delicious -- excellent flavors and just an overall enjoyable meal. If I'm ever back in LA, this will be a go-to!",5
"One of the most yelped places in Los Angeles and rightfully so. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_On a Friday afternoon (5pm), the wait was about 10-15 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There's a sign up sheet for people to put their name down. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Would recommend staying close by because we jumped a lot of names since they weren't there when a table was ready.We both got the combination ramen - one regular and the other with the spicy miso broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The regular broth had good depth of flavor, noodles were cooked well and the meat was very tender. The spicy miso wasn't that spicy (but we have a higher tolerance for spice). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There was a salad that came along with it and was the perfect amount of dressing and was very light (which was great) I got the shredded pork bowl which was delicious and had plenty of pork, saucy, green onions. Be I kinda which the combination had this as the large and the ramen was smaller. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Also got the tuna tartare bowl - good - can't go wrong if you have good ingredients.Good food and the service is amazing - quick and friendly staff!",4
"awesome spicy ramen. just like Tokyo. wait is usually 30 to 40 min for a party of 2, but well worth it. cash only. must try!",5
"My friend told me this is the most well-known ramen joint in LA so naturally I had to go. We arrived around 7:40pm with a wait time that was not too bad. We walked by again later around 9pm and there were more people waiting outside the restaurant! It's fairly small so there is not much room inside to wait for a seat. I ordered the Daikoku ramen and I found it to be alright. The egg was not as soft as I like, although similar to another ramen place called Kukai in Portland and some other cities. The portion size was huge but there is the option to order a half size, which I will do next time I come. PS they only take cash!",3
"High expectation for this. Little Tokyo edition. We waited outside for the restaurant to open at 11:00am. Short wait, seated instantly by the bar seats. Corner against the wall. I ordered the eel rice bowl (22.00$) and the specialty ramen (12.00$). The eel came out minutes from when I order, only to have me except it to be microwaved eel because of that speed it served. The ramen took around 15 minutes, considering all the other guests ordering before us or a bunch of ramen order at once. Service was almost perfect, really quick taking everyone's ordering during lunch rush hour. Cooks banging out food mad quick, prep game strong . Hefty amount of rice and teriyaki sauce on my rice bowl. Thick ramen broth, plenty of ramen on the bottom. The 22 buck rice bowl wasn't at all satisfying but I needed to try for myself rather than looking at year old pictures and drool over it. Overall a aright recommendation for the lunch. Maybe returning to this establishment, undecided. But surly ya need to try it for yourself.",3
"I'm really disappointed the broth of spicy miso ramen was not delicious only the pork was tender and ramen noodles. The best broth soup I recommend is at Hana Ichimonme Restaurant which is coconut champon it has pork soup base with coconut milk, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ground pork, sea food, beansprouts and onion it's worth it trust me",3
Yesterday I went to Daikokuya for dinner and got so sick when I got hom actually threw up twice last night this morning I contact the restaurant manager name Asuko to let her know what happened but nothing was done about it the only thing she said was all are vegetables are fresh if someone else called to complain we let you know and took my info. What a horrible customer service I been coming here since I move to Los Angeles at least twice a week with friends and family. Please think twice before you wait for an hr so later you can ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_get sick.,1
"I don't know how, but my friend and I got in after a wait of about 10 minutes on a Friday night. Between the two of us, we shared a combination of daikoku ramen with fried rice. The ramen was pretty good, and the fried rice was not that great. I'm not feeling the hype, wouldn't go out of my way to come back :(",3
"Seriously, the best ramen I've ever had. The broth was perfect. The egg was phenomenal. There was so much flavor to the food. I had the spicy miso ramen and my girlfriend had the daikoku ramen w/ kotteri flavor and no pork. I normally am not a huge fan of regular ramen or house ramen bowls but her Bowl had me dipping into it between bites of mine. Don't get me wrong -- the spicy miso was the best I've ever had, but I couldn't keep my chopsticks out of hers. Best way to put the quality of this ramen there were 4 ramen places on 1st street within a 10 storefront span and all of them were next to empty, but Daikokuya had a 30 min wait and no one seemed willing to go anywhere else but on Daikokuya's waiting list. As far as atmosphere goes the place is small, but most ramen places are. It was average size for a ramen place. Service was very fast and polite. I just loved this place. They only accept cash so be prepared for that. Our bill was $25 plus $5 for tip. We got extra bean sprouts. They're warmed and add an extra crunch. I'm happy only I asked for extra bean sprouts because one bowl of them were enough for us both. If I lived anywhere near little Tokyo I doubt I'd eat anything else. We didn't come up for air from our bowls during dinner beyond telling each other how good our bowls were. LolGo. Have fun. Enjoy. You won't regret it.",5
"My family always goes to this ramen shop when we are in LA japantown. Even though it was a super hot day of 110 degrees, ramen was still good. The place is very small and wants their waiting customers to wait outside. Even once inside, it was still hot. They only had two small AC units going. People kept opening the door so the restaurant never got cool. They had nice cold noodles options, but we came here for the original. It was nice that they had an option for more day for people who wanted a richer both. This place isn't that great for large parties unless you guys do not mind being squeezed in or separated. We noticed this place does not place dry seaweed with the noodles like some places we ate in our hometown. Regardless, the ramen overall was still good. The parking here is rough. People were save parking stops by blocking them off. There are garages near by to park in if the meter isn't for you. I think this place needs to expand. It is way too small",4
"This place is worth the wait! I'm not a big fan of ramen but oh my lanta this ramen house changed my mind on that! From what I read from reviews it has been said the wait is typically long. My friends and I came here during lunch hour and surprisingly we only had to wait about 20 minutes which was wonderful.Hands down definitely worth the drive (drove about 1 1/2) but needless to say, the workers here a very sweet and kind. The service was quick and food came very quickly!",5
Best ramen in LA. Love this place. Good place. Worth the wait. Am glad it has vegetarian options.,4
"Every time I go to LA, I always go to this ramen joint! Woohoo, there was no wait when we went there on a late Friday afternoon. I usually wait 1.5 hours so it was pretty surprising how there was no wait. It is conveniently located in a nice, food- adventurous neighborhood, therefore you can always get dessert around here. Service is A+ -- the staff is very attentive and polite :) it made the experience enjoyable. After trying several ramen restaurants, I think this is just ok. The chashu pork is tender that it instantly breaks apart when you pick it up. I just wish there were more of a variety of ingredients. It's practically covered in bean sprouts, green onions and a couple of bamboo shoots. Maybe add in a fish cake or seaweed? The noodles have a pretty hard consistency, which I'm not used to from other ramen joints. But the broth made up for it - super tasteful! Try their creamy broth than the standard broth!I recommend trying this once and maybe see if you like it? If not, there are plenty of other ramen joints in the area too!",3
I feel this is a below average ramen place. And it's cash only. I like Men-Oh and Tsujita better. Even Shin-Sen-Gumi is better than this.,2
"The food is pretty good. I'm not 100% savvy on the authenticity of traditional food. So I don't know how accurate they are. However, I wasn't impressed but I also wasn't dissatisfied.",4
"Whenever I came to Little Tokyo I always saw the line outside of the yellow umbrella of Daikokuya and wondered if it was good. I prompted to read reviews and called to make a reservation ,but unfortunately you cannot make a reservation. That was alright because at the end the ramen tasted real yummy. I mean it's not ramen from Japan, but it's still good! The servers were very welcoming , quick and fun to chit chat with.",4
"The taste is really just okay. The waiting is so long that I really don't get it. Come one, Little Tokyo, you can have better ramen.",3
"One of the oldest ramen spot in la, very traditional looking, seats are severely torn inside, food quality is great however, it is a CASH only place. Ordered the pork ramen with egg, and California rolls as side order, and fried dumpling. Would consider this place to be like a fast food type, as we were rushed to finish, so they can seat others waiting.",3
"Can't believe only rating at 4 stars,I will give 7 stars.Not because they give me sth beneficial,the best ever Ramen I have eaten so far!!!!! Awesome eel bowl Combo,so tasty.the hot sake really good Must come here",5
"Great food, terrible servers. Watch out for that one chick with a resting B face. She has the worst attitude problem.",3
Wow the ramen here is pretty good not excellent but pretty good. Broth- a little too eggy but it was rich in flavorRamen noodle- well that's for your preference to decide whether it suits you or notMeat- ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the seared tonkatsu pork was bomb. Adding a smokey flavor to the whole bowl of ramen. This review is missing 1 star because of how they rushed me out as soon as I got in after an hour of waiting. Customer service would asnt the best. Would still come here though.,4
"First time here for a late-night dinner. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The line was worth waiting for, especially from seeing how all the other Ramen places next to it looks kind-off empty compare to this long line here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I noticed how they have over 6K reviews with a positive 4-stars that drew my attention to let my hunger waits.Got their ""Specialty"" Daikoku Ramen $11.00 with their famous tonkotsu soup base, which is infused with their secret blended soy sauce (not salty and on point). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Comes with boiled chijire style egg noodles (fresh and home-made, I believe), and the firmness can be altered upon request, but I shall keep it to the Chef's original. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Topped it off with kurobuta pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.Customer service was good, but subtracted 1-star for my marinated boiled egg was not completely peeled off. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I noticed a small white crack on the egg as I picked it up with my chopsticks. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Other than that, everything was good.",4
"Put in your name on the waiting list, go over to Little Tokyo and get some mochi, and come back for the deliciousness. Get the original Ramen with Extra Back Fat -- you won't regret it, my friends.A quaint place, casual with awesome old propaganda posters on the walls and full tables... Go to Daikokuya and embrace the amazing flavor. The bowls are big, so it's even better- makes great leftovers!!",5
"Service and ambiance were nice, food was disappointing. We were visiting LA from the east coast and decided to come wait in line after seeing the yelp reviews. We got here right around opening time, put our names down, and got in after 30 minutes. We tried several of the dishes including the sausage appetizer, sliced roast pork, spicy miso with pork katsu combo and daikoku ramen. I was most disappointed by the ramen. While the noodles were tasty and had a good consistency, the broths were really nothing special. The spicy miso was far too gingery and both just didn't have the richness that I've tasted from ramen joints in NY. The pork was also just very average, tender but not melt-in-your-mouth tender; and the eggs come hard-boiled rather than soft-boiled. The appetizers were pretty good, though. They use the same roast pork slices that they put in the ramen for the appetizer and just fry it with some eel sauce and scallions. Tasty, but again nothing too special. Overall, a bit of a disappointing experience given the hype, but atleast the food was cheap. If you want noodles and don't mind the wait, go to Monzo right next door for a great bowl of udon instead.",3
Make sure you're really listening for the host cuz she mutters and talks really quickly and apparently if you don't respond right away she moves on. The evening started off a bit rocky because it was already an hour wait but on top of that the host had skipped over our name after calling it out ONCE. We were present but she called out Brian instead of Brent and when we notified her of the mistake and that she had skipped over us she responded in dismay as if we were lying. The food was good though. The food came out really quickly. However it does come whenever it's ready so not everyone's food comes at once. It didn't bother us but some people may not like that. Service was average.Food (4/5) Service (3.5/5) but with the host problem (2.5/5) =(6.5/10),3
Awesome place! I love the vegan tomato Raman and the portions are huuuuge. Only downside is cash only &amp; the wait can be long so be prepared!,5
"Food is amazing, service is good. Gets a little too stuffed and hot inside maybe some Air-conditioning.And the wait is long but it's totally worth it",4
"When I entered Daokokuya, I felt transported from the bustling modern streets of LA to a classic and timeless little ramen spot. If you're tired of eating ramen loaded with trendy toppings and being surrounded with hip decor, this is the place for you. The wait here is no joke. I came on a Saturday around 8pm and my party of 5 waited 1.5 hours to be seated. Good thing there is so many shops to explore in little Tokyo. After finally getting a spot, We were sat in a old looking booth with beat up seats. We all ordered the Daikokuya ramen ($11), and it was absolutely delicious. The noodles were chewy and tasted hand pulled. The broth was rich with delicious pork flavor. It's no wonder folks here are willing to wait so long when there are two other ramen shops on the same exact street! This place is absolutely no frills. The staff is not overtly friendly and pretty straight to the point but I noticed that our waters were dutifully refilled throughout the meal. This is absolutely one of the best bowls of ramen I've ever had, but I'd recommend stopping by when it's not peak hours if possible .",5
We're from Alaska and have our vacation in LA. We love japanese foods and ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_heard about Little Tokyo and found this shop. We were planning to have our breakfast here but the line was so long and we tried to call if they do reservations but they said they can't. So we were planning to go at night and just wait for an hour. The wait was really worth it! The ramen taste so good and the eel too. I really want to come back here again. And you can only pay cash only and the long wait again is still worth it. Love this place i recommend it to my friends,5
Recommended by many as the best ramen place in LA and I can see why. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Keep in mind cash only!!The price is very affordable under 10$ for a meal is always a great deal. The ramen is amazing. I can't describe it but just think thick salty soup which is not a great description but it is really good. Service is on the rush side but understandably so. They are always packed with a line out the door. Decor is set up like a traditional Japanese ramen shop like those you would see in anime or Japanese tv dramas. It's small and bustling. Try many of the side dishes. The main thing is of course the ramen but the sides are fairly cheap and usually can discover something new you like. They opened up a new shop in west Hollywood that should have less of a line once the grand opening is over.,5
"If you want to wait 45 mins for okay ramen, this is the place. For years, my friends have raved about Daikokuya on social media and finally tonight I got to partake and discovered that this place is hyped like no other and doesn't seem to stand up. Parking:Anytime you want to come to this area of town, be ready to shell out at least $5+ for parking if you're not able to find a metered spot on the street. On the weekends be prepared to pay $8-10. There's no way around it.Initial impression and ambiance:A place that takes CASH ONLY with a throng of people crowded outside at 5:40 in the evening, my initial impression was this place has got to be good, right?. It's not even peak dinner time yet. When I went in to put my name down to reserve a spot, I took a look around inside, it had a dated feel to it so it must be one of those places that's a grimy hole in the wall that serves great food. Service:You only get one chance at making a first impression and the person who was calling the names on the wait list and seating people could care less. When she got to my name and number on the list she called it out and didn't even give time for me to respond before turning around and going to another area. No problem, I just went up with my wife and waited for her to come back to the wait list and told her that I was one of the numbers she called. Her response was almost one of exasperation and suspicion like I was trying to snake someone's place in line. After pointing to my name on the list and about to take out my driver's license just to show her, she relents and points to the counter communicating that those are our seats. Food: Since my wife and I were 20th on the list to be seated, I was poring over their menu imagining how good the food was going to be. All those people milling around outside weren't suckers were they? I overheard some person telling someone who was eating there for the first time that they had to try the original ramen and that it was going to ""blow their mind."" That sure set the bar high for me.We ordered the tempura appetizer, original Daikokuya ramen, spicy miso ramen, and an order of fried rice that came with a bowl of miso soup and shredded cabbage with their own house dressing that they also sell separately. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When the tempura was brought out, it looked sad and soggy almost as if it was cooked up a hour before and dunked in boiling hot oil just to heat it up again. The tempura breading on the shrimp and veggies were just soggy and not crispy at all. Ok, so this is not their forte. I'm here for the ramen!Upon taking the first bite of the ramen, my initial impression was that it was pretty salty but the broth flavor was good. The noodles were hot but when I went to slurp the soup, it was warm moving towards being tepid but held up by the noodles which were really hot. When I took a bite of the egg, it was slightly warm. Bleh. Let's also not forget the MSG after taste.As for the fried rice, miso soup and shredded cabbage with their house dressing; the dressing on the shredded cabbage was tasty. That was the best part. The fried rice wasn't bad, however, the miso soup was surprisingly bad for a place that makes ramen. It tasted like hot swimming pool water mixed with a hint of miso, some tofu and seaweed. One sip and that was all she wrote. Conclusion:The ramen was decent, but far from being good enough to make me want to wait as long as I did. If you want great ramen, go to the food court at the Mitsuwa market and try Hokkaido Ramen Santouka instead.",2
"Holy potatoes, this place has nearly SEVEN KAY reviews?! When you search up ""ramen"" in Los Angeles, Daikokuya will most likely be the first place that comes up on top. This restaurant is INSANELY popular. I've driven around Japan town trying to get a number numerous times and every time the wait was way too long.Luckily, my friend and I were in the area around 11am (right when it opens) on a Friday morning and it was even packed then. We tried to squeeze it right before the lunch rush. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Although parking is a big pain (you won't be able to find free parking unless you get those 2 hour spots, but that will be nearly impossible in the downtown area), there's plenty of meter parking nearby the restaurant.I put in about 2 hours thinking it would take forever but we actually got in really quickly. The wait was around 10 minutes, which was perfect. I really liked the ambiance when we walked in. There's a little curtain at the door which I feel like, walking through it transports you into a different world. The place itself is small, which makes wait times so long. There's only a few booths with one long counter. Their menu is actually really small. Even though this place is known for the ramen, there's only two simple choices: the Daikokuya special and the spicy shio. My friend and I both got the Daikokuya.Our ramen bowls came out pretty quickly, which was a bonus. Even though I joined the ramen game pretty late, I felt like I do have a good taste for good, bad, and great ramen. I would say that the ramen at Daikokuya was really good, but not the best I've ever had. The broth was really savory and not too salty. The portion size is decent for lunch but not too overwhelming; there's not too many ingredients, but enough for a medium sized meal my opinion. You get a few pieces of pork tonkatsu, an egg, as well as several pieces of bamboo. If I had to rate the ramen compared to all the other ramen shops I've been to, this one would probably be around an 8/10. It was great, but not mind blowing. I guess this place gets all the hype because of the other stuff that they have? But if this place is hyped from the ramen, you may want to pass for another place; you may not like the result after waiting 2-3 hours. Luckily we only waited 10 minutes, and we were happy with that. The prices are not too bad either. It's around $12-13 for each ramen bowl, which I find standard at most places nowadays. Service is amazing as well.Oh yea, it's cash only. Bring cash!!!Eat well and prosper,",4
"I haven't been to any ramen shops in the west coast, but I have been to quite a few in Japan, and a few in the midwest. This is hands down the closest I have gotten to experiencing Japanese ramen in the states. Went with the standard Daikokuya Ramen bowl with an Asahi beer. The wait wasn't terrible on a Sunday at 4pm, and it was totally worth it. The atmosphere was great and the staff was fantastic. Thanks for the great experience!",4
I came here for the vegan ramen. The broth was great and the Japanese IPA was really good. The noodles were a little hard. We drove about 40 minutes to get here. Not worth the drive for me.,3
"Visited with the family for the first time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So many ramen establishments in Little Tokyo, chose Daikokuya based on yelp reviews and proximity to our location. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Waited about 20 minutes for a table for 4 (11:00AM on a Saturday). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ordered the Daikoku ramen with koterri and a side of tempura veggies and shrimp. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Very rich (koterri, the back fat makes a difference), flavorful, and ramen noodles were good (Note: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_added lots of ginger to my ramen - very, very good). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ I enjoyed the tempura as well - nice variety of veggies (potato, carrot, onion, green bean). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Overall ramen and other food is equivalent to many other ramen places - tasty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Nothing stands out from other options - simply good.Food = 4 starsService = 5 stars (extremely nice and accommodating)Price = 4 stars (similar to other ramen spots)Ambience = 3 stars (small, crowded)",4
Yikes. I'm sorry :-( Don't know what all the hypes about.....Lines are always out the doorThe place is TINYAnd HOT The food:Soup was goodThe noodles were undercookedOne small piece of chashu Not worth.,2
"My expectations were too high and the ramen ended up disappointing me. I ordered the daikoku ramen combo with pork cutlet and a side of salad.The salad was good, plenty of sauce. The pork cutlet however was not cooked enough and ended up being hard to bite. The daikoku ramen also lacked flavor and had some pretty bad bean sprouts.",2
"The place is pretty small and warm, in the summer its sweltering. The food is amazing and the fried rice is my favorite. The food comes out pretty quickly and the servers are very attentiveThey only accept cash and they have signs everywhere to remind you.",5
I've always heard about this place from friends and wanted to give Daikokuya's ramen a try. They did not disappoint. I got their daikoku ramen (their specialty) and it was soooo good! The broth was unlike any other ramen place I've been to and the chashu pork was so soft and delicious. The only down part I would say is the super long wait time and it is cash only. But don't worry! They have an ATM in the back of the restaurant :),4
"The Daikoku Ramen be thicc AFYou can get it extra thicc AF tooThis is my favorite ramen bar in LA (followed by Tatsu, Slurpin' Ramen, Shin Sen Gumi, and Tsujita).For the price and quality, it's worth the wait on a busy night. Get the GyozaCASH ONLY!",5
We were hungry for something warm after the Billy Joel Concert at the Dodger Stadium and this place is open late. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There was no wait at the time so we were seated right away. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My friend ordered the vegetable ramen and tofu ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's a cute little place.,3
"We didn't know what to expect walking into this place with all the cash only signs posted everywhere in this small restaurant, but wow...the food was amazing! I know this is a ramen place, but the vegetable tempura was unbelievably good as was the chicken teriyaki and fried rice. Next time we're in Little Tokyo, we're definitely trying the ramen!",5
Definitely a must have if you enjoy ramen and happen to be in Little Tokyo. The takoyaki are delicious and the best I've ever had. The potstickers were clearly made by hand and not frozen from a package. The filling was all meat with no veggie fillers. The pork broth ramen was excellent! The egg was perfect. The noodles were the best ramen noodles I've ever had. My only gripe was the broth (I know it's preference and I'm no ramen expert) but I've had better. Still good nonetheless. Service was fast and friendly enough. I recommend getting here early because there is a line before they even open.,4
"I can't believe I waited this long to write a review! I swear I thought I already wrote one for this place. Ramen is hard to come by in SoCal. Let me reword that -- good ramen is hard to come by! This place is hands down the best ramen place I have been to in LA. A lot of people say Shin Sen Gumi is good too, but in my opinion, the noodles here are FRESH! And that makes all the difference. I guess it all really depends on how you like your noodles. I like that Daikokuya's is fresh and thick. The kotteri broth is a must! I've never tried it without kotteri (so I can't really say what the regular broth tastes like) but it's a must-try, if you haven't already. Oh and one piece of advice, if you're a vegetarian, don't order ramen. Everything is served with pork broth. We witnessed a girl order the tonkatsu ramen and she later screamed out that she was a vegetarian. Yikes! If you're not in the mood for ramen, or maybe wanna share a combo, their fried rice and the shredded pork bowl are our next favorites!!! The shredded pork is kurobuta pork, so you know it's good!!",5
It was so delicious! My friend took me and had hyped it up for months so I was a little scared it wouldn't be what I expected but wow! Don't let the long line scare you it's well worth the wait. I would definitely hang around the front. Names get called really fast or really slow. So just be patient and wait. Ramen was perfect and the best I've had so far! Will definitely make a trip down again! Sitting area is small but good atmosphere.,5
"Been here too many times to count. Each and every time has a 30-60 minute wait, but it was worth it. Service has always been fast and energetic. Both waiters and waitresses are friendly and on top of everything.I've had combos of the ramen with Kotteri plus the shredded pork bowl as well as the Gyoza. Kotteri is definitely top tier if you're okay with a stockier, fattier soup base. Though there's no choice of hardness of the noodles itself, I'd say it comes at a middle level. Not too hard, not too soft. Overall, this is one of my favorite go-to ramen joints in Southern California - so long as you have the patience to wait in line.",5
Great place for a snack. The dishes are excellent with a choice of different fillings. Homemade dumplings are really good. Only accept cash!,4
"Dang. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_9 PM on a weekday and it still took 45 minutes before we got seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Be sure you come here with someone who's presence you enjoy or you're in for a long, wait time filled with awkward silences, and desperate glances on your phone hoping something interesting shows up on the screen.Such a teeny, tiny place which is reminiscent of Shin Sen Gumi in Monterey Park. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The space is so small my legs felt awkward while we ate. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_BUT! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But at least the food was good.Daikokuya Ramen- Broth was very full of flavor and creamy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And this is without the added pork back fat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork slices were very tender and I was even impressed by the boiled egg they have in there. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Of course, I think quality wise its not any different from a lot of ramen places all over Los Angeles but I'm just glad I wasn't disappointed after our long wait.Takoyaki- ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Octopus balls? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Why, of course, dear sir. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_How can I say no to those golden brown balls with creamy goodness inside? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_In all honesty, I've hated every single takoyaki I've tried but that hasn't stopped me from ordering each time I see it on the menu. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And finally. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_FINALLY. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I found the one place with great takoyakis. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Soft, creamy and with bits of octopus meat inside, these little ones (or big ones - it's a matter of perspective) are worth their price. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_One more thing crossed off my Bookmark list.",4
"Great food, a must stop place if you're stopping in Downtown LA or in little Tokyo. Raman for days and taste like you're in Japan.",5
"One of the better Ramen I've had in the LA area. The line says it all. My mrs and I were standing outside of the restaurant with a sea of other people waiting for our names and numbers to be called, by a friendly, albeit seemingly tired, hostess in a whisper. As we stared inside longingly, stomachs growling, hunger turned into resentment for all the other people who were eating like snails. One hour later, we finally got seated and admittedly order.She got: Daikokuya RamenI got: the pork cutlet bowl. Our food came out quickly. After the obligatory pictures we jumped right into it. I really enjoyed the pork cutlet. The pork is quite large and the egg on top adds a nice texture to it. The soy sauce marinade just adds to the flavoring and my resentment transformed to happiness. The ramen had a nice flavor, but maybe it was mixture of both of our meals, but I was so thirsty. Beware that there is a lot of salt so bring some extra water. CASH ONLY!!!The mrs and I were in and out in 20 minutes. Arguably the way Ramen places should be.",4
"Honestly it's my favorite ramen I've ever tried, it deserves all the great reviews it has. I hear that people wait in line over an hour at times but I've gone twice and on sundays before 5 pm and I didn't wait more than 25 mins.",5
"The ramen is to die for, it's sooooo good. They have fresh ramen made by hand and also the soup base is amazing. It's easy to get to, you can get the bus or the gold line metro train to little Tokyo and walk a block to it or you can uber there. There is only street parking with meters but that's to be expected in LA. Also there is a paid parking lot across the street runs at 15 bucks per car.Problems though is that your looking at a 40 minute wait usually if not longer and they don't take reservations. Also they only take cash but it is posted outside and inside the restaurant so you can't act like you didn't know, they do have an ATM in the back by the restrooms just in case. The waiting area inside the restaurant only fits about 10 people sitting on little stools, all others must wait outside after adding their name to the waitlist. Would I go again....hell yes, food is sooo good!",5
"I finally got to try this place after hearing about how good their ramen was. We ended up waiting about 45+ minutes because we had 5 people in our group. We arrived there on a Friday night at around 730pm We had to constantly bother the girl calling out the names because she would pop in and out in order to call names. Good thing we bothered her because after about 45 minutes we bothered her again and she said she already called our name. After we were seated, my cousins ordered spicy ramen and I ordered the regular ramen. To be honest, ramen should be hot, but it wasn't hot, it was lukewarm. The plus side was the gooey hard boiled eggs, I love that! The pork that they put in the ramen was okay as well, I've had some amazing ramen before and usually the pork is soft. Now the fun part, in the middle of eating our ramen, a homeless woman kept coming into the restaurant. She was clearly a drug addict because she was mumbling to herself and was asked to leave several times, with force. She came in multiple times and even touched my cousin's hair. It was terrible. She was bothering the other customers and really scared my cousins. After we paid our bill (cash only) we talked to the waiter and apparently she comes in every night! I'm giving this 3 star because of the food and wait. What I experienced there with the homeless lady did not heavily impact the rating of this place. Mainly, I've tried other places that are better and less of a wait!",3
"We got there at 9:30 PM on a Saturday night and probably had to wait 45 minutes to get a table for two. This place was definitely good, but I don't understand the hype at all. Prices were reasonable and ramen was good, but it didn't seem AMAZING or anything. It's nice you can get a decent-size side dish + a large bowl of ramen for like $18.",3
This is probably my favorite ramen place in LA!!!!! Highly recommend!!!! A review from Asian guy,5
"The place was super packed, and lines of people waiting to eat seems to be the norm for this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We probably waited around 30mins to be seated.Although the wait was long the food was very good and tasted authentic. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Every bite reminded me of Japan; I thought it was that good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the beef bowl (delicious), my brother ordered the pork cutlet bowl (I didn't try it), and my sister order the house ramen (delicious).I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience what real Japanese food tastes like without all the traveling.",5
"Long wait, but considering the location it wasn't half bad. The ramen was more than enough to satisfy you. The only minor inconvenience was that the location only takes cash.",4
"Lived in both US and Japan, I think the ramen is just ok - average. I recommend Tsujita more personally.",2
"This place is BOMB. I visited with my sister, aunt and cousin a few weeks ago after a long day and the ramen definitely hit the spot! I had the Tsukemen ramen, which is their normal ramen, but with everything but the broth placed aside. It's so good, probably one of the best ramen I have ever had! By having everything out of the broth while I ate it, the ramen noodles stayed at the consistency I prefer AND I was able to limit my sodium intake (because I'm one of those people that gets headaches from too much salt =[ sadness and sorrow). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And yes, the wait is long. I suggest putting your name down and then hopping over to one of the nearby places for Happy Hour, it will definitely make the time pass by faster. That being said, get back at a feasible time because if you're not there when they call your name, you may just get passed over. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And based on the deliciousness of the ramen, you will NOT want that to happen.PS. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_CASH ONLY.",4
Omg I have never had ramen so good. The broth has such a great flavor and the staff is super friendly and efficient. I added the extra fatty flavoring and didn't note a huge difference to the regular. The noodles we're also the best I've ever had.,5
"The best ramen I've ever had in my entire life. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There are queues out the door at any time of the day and night here, from lunchtime till closing around midnight which are a testament to the popularity of the place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is definitely one of the hidden gems of LA.",5

Not as good as I expected. The noodle is normalÃ¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_soup is really salty. I don't know why the rate is really high in yelpÃ¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒâ„¢BTWÃ¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_cash only Ã¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_and hard to find a park palce.,2
This place was awesome ! The service was beyond great ! Made me feel like I was in a real ramen shop in Tokyo .,5
"Every time I drive anywhere that involves going though Los Angeles, I always stop in Little Tokyo. This little place has been on my radar a long time due to EVERYONE telling me its the best place to go to. With my last trip to LA, I found myself outside with no line (which is a miracle, trust me) and walked inside. Service was prompt, as most shops are around here. We ordered 2 waters and some gyoza. Waters came filled around 3/4 full with no ice. As a person that doesn't want ice makes this ok, but for the vast majority makes this a no-no. Our gyoza order comes shortly after and is nothing I have ever seen. It was pan seared as essentially 1 gigantic piece which we had to break up, all the while making a mess of the food. Not pleasant. Our food came out (I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen with no pork) very quickly to say the least. I had ordered extra bean sprouts but instead received bamboo shoots. It took a long time for our server to come back for an exchange. My main issue is why have the extra ingredient on the side? Is it not possible for it to be added in the preparation stage so it comes up to temperature as well? There are other places in this area that do the same, where all my extra items were on the side. I want my flavors to marry together as one, not add them in and wait as my food gets cold. The flavor of the base was good, just not great. There was essentially no spice to the dish, and had unnecessary oil for some reason. The portions are great though, with fresh vegetables and firm noodles. They add a lot of green onions, so be forewarned Overall, the food is good, not great. The service was ok, but needs some attention. Do not sit at the front right seats at the bar. There is a deep fryer there that is insanely hot and will ruin your experience, as it did mine.",3
"Ever since my sister and her family moved to LA from DC last year, we've been wanting to try the ramen here at Daikokuya. She only lives a couple of blocks from here, so we always pass by it. However, there's always a bunch of people waiting outside. On this visit, my 4th one within the past year, we finally got to have ramen here! Hallelujah! My need for a good ramen fix has finally come to fruition. We only had to wait 15 minutes tops to get seated at the bar/counter. It's such a tiny place that we would have had to wait longer if we wanted a booth. Bar seating was fine, though it got to be quite warm where we were which was next to the kitchen. We ordered the Gyoza for an appetizer and I have to say that it's the best Gyoza I've had in a long long time! We enjoyed it so much we ordered another one after finishing it. The super crispy top of the gyoza adds so much flavor to the whole thing. So freaking good!!! Thrillist calls it a ""masterpiece"" and who am I to argue with that! We both ordered the Daikoku Ramen which is their Tonkotsu based ramen. We didn't ask for any additions and we didn't really need any. Great ramen! Loved the broth! Definitely better than the ramen we had at Mr. Ramen which is a few doors down a few months ago. If you sit by the bar, you'll soon have rivulets of sweat rolling down your temples as you're eating your ramen. As soon as we finished our ramen and Gyoza, we paid up (cash only!!!) and went outside to cool down! Ahh, fresh air...We'll be back Daikokuya!",5
"My expectations were high. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I wanted to try the best ramen in town. So we spent about 90 minutes in line at 2 pm on a Sunday, and while the ramen was good - I don't really see what's so special about it compared to other top ramen places that don't have a wait anywhere near this long. Don't get me wrong - it's very good - but not really worth the wait, which is inevitable. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is on the thicker side and the spicy wasn't really very spicy.I was so starving by the team that we were seated that I ordered the combo with the eel rice bowl and didn't even touch the eel since the ramen was so filling.Tip: They call out parties by number, so make sure you note what # you write our name next to on the sign in sheet. If you miss your name, you are out of luck - so that keeps you from really being able to go anywhere while you are waiting.",3
Went there for lunch and sat at the bar... I loved the place it seemed to be in Japan. The food is very authentic and the service was good. This place is Cash only.,5
"One of the best bowls of ramen I've had. Although there is a bit of a wait to be seated, I felt it was well worth it. The service was good and the food came out pretty fast. Definitely coming back",5
"Oh my ~ what a perfectly satisfying meal. I don't care what time of year it is or what the weather is. This is the place to be to fulfill your ramen needs, wants, hopes and dreams. No wonder why Yelp is crazy about this place. They're quick and fast with the service. Our wait was only like 20 mins in the middle of the summer afternoon. Nice filtered ice water to cool us down. We sat at the bar which was a downfall (pretty much sweating through our entire meal) we both go the Daikon Ramen and loaded it up with chili oil, garlic, picked ginger and extra seasoning. It was slurping good. Probably will be on the top of our great foodie adventures. It's cash only too, so be prepared for that. When I got my cash back they did it in big bills instead of singles (smart way to make you tip more, I see you). So yeah 4/5. Worth coming back to when we are in Little Tokyo and definitely when it's colder.",4
Extremely disgustingly grimy. Aside from that they messed up my order and had the nerve to change me extra without my consent. There's a reason why other places have a wait and this one doesn't,1
Damn!!! Wait was sooo long!! Couldn't believe that it took so long to get a table but it was well worth the wait. It helps to know that while you're waiting there's shopping outlets to go to. Once you step in it's very cramped and it doesn't have the nicest ambiance but they do know how to cook food. I really like this ramen spot and I would definitely come back again to enjoy the great broth and noodles. If you're on a date this a good place to go to. Enjoy the ramen!!,5
"As a first time diner, let's be honest, this place has seen some traffic. The combo pork cutlet (topped on rice with eggy bits), and ramen were excellent and enough for two, but standing in the grimy space and observing their various tchotchkes caked in a thick layer of dust didn't do much for my appetite. This eatery needs a thorough cleaning. Hole in the wall vibe I can dig, decades of dust and grime I cannot. Just keep it clean guys, people eat there.",3
"The daikoku ramen bowl here is good, but the fried rice that comes with the combo is better!",4
"Finally got in after waiting only about 15 minutes prior to their 11:00 opening on a Sunday in the middle of a Memorial Day weekend. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Yay! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The last few times we came to Little Tokyo the wait was too long. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But this time we were pretty shocked we did. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had the basic Daikoku Ramen bowl, my wife had the spicy ramen bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_To start we ordered small, with the tsukemono appetizer. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The assorted pickles, kimchi, and radish with shiso leaf was outstanding. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I took a picture of this fresh, not overly vinegary treat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The perfect starter. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Both bowls of ramen were spectacular, perfectly prepared with a truly wonderful broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'm not sure it would have been worth a super long wait, but I was very happy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This cash only restaurant is well decorated, and the service is friendly and efficient. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Bottom line is that we really enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, and the service. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall a five-star ramen experience.",5
"In a nutshell: Your first choice for ramen in Little Tokyo....no really.I love ramen. I love going to different ramen places to try different broths from different parts of Japan. Most places are good, some are so-so. Every time I've tried to go to Daikokuya, there's always been a large group of people waiting outside to be seated, and every time I think to myself, ""There are plenty of places just as good in this area"" and I go somewhere else. This time around, I decided to wait it out, and I was not disappointed.Parking 4/5If you don't find parking on the street, there are paid lots in the area.Ambience 3/5Small place with limited seats, which explains the long wait. I waited outside and I didn't pay attention to the decor once the food came out.Seating time 2/5Not their fault they're so popular. The turnaround is pretty quick, but expect to wait at least 45 minutes (on a slow night) regardless.Food wait time 5/5From order placement to table - less than 5 minutes!!!! Service 5/5VERY quick. Efficient and fast. Don't expect conversation, but expect your food to come out at almost the same time as the drinks you ordered.Food 5/5MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.......Spicy Miso Ramen - A+Not too spicy, I got extra chili oil and it was still manageable. The seasoned egg was SO good, but that was not even close to being the star of the show. Actually there were two stars: (1) the broth and (2) the pork belly. I didn't realize how subpar all the broths I've had in the past were, because this broth was fatty without being too thick and DEEE::explitive::LICIOUS!!! Pork belly was so tender it melted in my mouth. I'm drooling again.....gonna need a new shirt....Mini Pork cutlet bowl - APretty damn good. Pork was nice and tender, and had a great balance of egg and onions. Perfect way to round out the ramen.Overall 5/5So good, I'm mad at myself for not coming here sooner. This is a pattern for most of my reviews. I have a problem.Highly recommend!!!!",5
"Classic, traditional, delicious, ramen. The only reason why I don't come here more often is because of the rediculous wait. We got the takoyaki, a spicy miso ramen, and a regular ramen. Both ramens were savory, umami, and super meaty. The takoyaki was delicious as well. If you want a different taste, I suggest getting a side salad for just 1 dollar. The dressing they use is so delicious! Overall, a great warm meal!",4
"They probably don't need another 5 star review ! But, I have to say every time when we're in the area, we have to stop by this place! We got there around 1pm, and we only waited about 15 minutes to get our seats. We ordered 2 combos meal-- Daikoku Ramen and Fried Rice, Tsukemen dipping Ramen and Beef Rice Bowl. Honestly, we ordered way too much food for 2 persons, but we have to try everything! Anyways, their ramen is one of the best ones That I've ever tasted!!! Make sure you get the ramen with the richer Kotteri flavor which was extracted from the back fat, yummy! Another thing that I always order is the famous fried rice! It's got small pieces of pork which will melt inside your mouth! The Tsukemen dipping ramen and the beef rice bowl were just okay. I'm already looking forward to come back here to get more fried rice!!",5
"its confirmed, I don't like daikokuya. Been coming back to see if my initial experience was not actual daikokuya. Came back 12+times and now I'm certain. I prefer the milky, rich pork bone based, 15hr berkshire pork brewed hakata ramen at shin sen gumi. Its all about the broth and daikokuya while its the same tonkatsu ramen is bland and salty.",3
"Amazing broth flavor, bamboo shoots had amazing texture, noodle had great mouth feel, loved the balanced sprouts kept great qualities, fully textured, eliminated uncessary raw flavor, pork was cooked amazingly could tell it was more fresh than most places didn't have the overnight fridge taste achtypal to the pork back fat game. Definitely lives up to the hype as you can tell",5
"Have you seen how many reviews this place has? I was introduced to this place by a friend and we decided to go right before they were supposed to close and unlike a lot of reviewers here, we didn't have much of a line to stand in (mind you this was almost midnight so that explains a lot). I thought we were in for shitty service given we would be holding them up from closing on time and getting home, but was really surprised to experience otherwise. We ordered a couple of dishes because I really wanted to try their offerings and not a single dish let me down. You can tell they are well equipped to handle a large volume of clients because our food appeared on our table within 5 minutes of placing our order (miracles do happen!) Please don't take the 5 stars for the appearance or location of this establishment because that alone would be rated 2 stars but who really cares about that when the food makes up for everything. Oh, service was great, too!",5
"I am a ramen person, and have tried ramen in different countries and cities. For me, this flavor is pretty good and authentic. My favorite snack is called tofu nuggets, is extremely tasty with the sweet chili sauce",5
"++ Stop #8 and #9 in my jury duty food adventures ++To my immense surprise and pleasure, it was completely do-able to powerwalk here from the Courthouse, enjoy a leisurely lunch, and powerwalk back within 1.5 hours. Around 12 on a weekday, there was very little wait! This is a far cry from the last time I tried to eat dinner here on a weekend and the wait was probably 1.5 hours in itself. Don't forget about the CASH ONLY! But even if you do, there are a few major banks located within a mile. The really nice thing is that once you sit your cheeks down at a table, you place your order and receive it within minutes. They are all about efficiency, it's just that they don't have the physical room to accommodate the demand. * DAIKOKU RAMEN ($9.95): Ordered it =kotteri= style so the broth was richer. This is like...my golden standard for ramen broth. I could not get enough of it and drank every drop, which is probably really unhealthy. Chashu is melt-in-your-mouth tender. Noodles are the perfect firmness for me the way they are, but you can always ask for different firmness. Every element here meshes together perfectly. ~ 5/5* SPICY MISO RAMEN ($10.95): The spicy is a bit of a misnomer, because it is not very spicy by itself. However, you can ask for chili oil to add on. The broth in this one is creamy and rich, but it does not compare to the Daikoku broth (for me). Still very good though, and the toppings are consistently perfect. ~ 4.5/5Food: 5, Service: 4, Environment: 4, Price: 3",5
"humm... ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've tried this place before and it didn't leave me with much thought. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've tried this place three times and still couldn't figure out why people hyped it so much. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_As much review as this place have and the rating they received, I couldn't wrapped my head around the buzz that people been clamoring about. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think its a bit overrated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My two stars for them isn't to designate their quality of ramen being poor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Its decent. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Its just I've had better.This ramen place, figuring as famous as they are, should yield a few more selections for their patrons then their choice of two. House special and Spicy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But hey, there are restaurants out there that have limited items on the menu and done well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Well.... their ramen is plainly underwhelming. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Broth was on the light side. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had to douse my bowl with their table spice and garlic paste to enrich the flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A regular bowl can feed two by the way. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had so much noodles where it became monotonous to finish. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ratio of ingredients were a off. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Luckily, I ordered extra bean sprouts to have more texture than of the noodle. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The redundant noodle and lackluster of a broth set me back a bit. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Again, I might concluded that its in Japan town, small joint, two choice of ramen, late hours, interior decor and long wait gave it its hype. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Truly, I've had better before from San Francisco, New York, and even Austin. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you never been here, I encourage you to try and see for yourself. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Again, I've tried this place multiple times and results are the same. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just to name a few places for bases of comparison, SF: Ramen Dojo. New York: Ippudo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Austin: Ramen Tatsuya. Also, Santouka in Mitsuwa.",2
"I finally got to try this place out after bookmarking it for ages. Every time I come here, there is always a long wait. i finally got to try their ramen. While good, it was nothing special. I definitely have had better. I like the meat here because it was really soft. The broth was on the heavier side. I like that the ramen here makes me feel full compared to other places where I'm still hungry afterwards. I like it here but I don't think it was worth the wait. But its located in an area where you can walk around and browse while you wait.",4
A small and quaint area. We were all not hungry enough for a full bowl but wanted to try the ramen so ordered the half size for $7.50- totally worth it and a great portion. Ordered the original ramen- broth was on point and the meat was also so tender. Would totally go back to try the spicy miso! Be sure to add some of the ginger and a touch of nori :),5
We sit next to the kitchen. It's super crazy hot. The ramen soup is very salty. I need to keep drinking water to finish it. The egg in the ramen is so sticky in my mouth which is weird. I don't know if it is overcooked or what. The noodle is too hard. I will never visit again. Very disappointed.,1
"Checked this place out based on the insane number of Yelp reviews. I got there at about noonish on a Monday (it was Presidents' Day so I don't know if that helped or hurt things wait time wise) and there was already a mega line. We signed up and were number 40 on the list. It took about an hour to get sat.Excellent ramen. The noodles especially were on point. We tried their signature ramen, spicy miso ramen, and pork cutlet. All delish and top notch! Super quick service and food preparation too. Also very cool that they have tsukemen on the menu.Payment is cash only but they have their own atm in the back of the restaurant by the bathrooms. Well worth the wait and plenty of things to do nearby like pick up some banging mochi a few doors down and have dessert first.",5
Not as good as expected... Waited half an hour because it got the most reviews. But I had better Ramen in other less reviewed places...,3
"The outside is deceiving as it looks a little run down, but the food is delicious! Waited about 50 mins, but totally worth it! Probably wouldn't wait that long again because there's so many great ramen places, but would definitely recommend.",4
"Nope nope nope and nope. I'm not sure if the restaurant is overhyped or they invited all relatives and friends or hire high school students to give them extremely over the top "" best ramen on earth"" "" best ramen in LA"" ""best ramen in the universe"", ""best ramen like I have never had in my life"", "" best ramen I ever had because I was standing outside waiting for an hour and starving to dead"". Ramen is decent. Listen up people, it's DECENT! Please don't waste your time waiting hour for this basic ass bowl of ramen with basic broth. I was so hyped up the ""rich, cream, flavorful"" broth. I was so underwhelm when I first try the broth, it was bland, not that rich at all. Noodle is not chewy enough so the texture just okay when you eat with bean spouts and bamboo slices. Meat is dry, so don't expect the juicy chew out of it. Egg was little bit overcooked. Soup was so bland I have to put gingers and soup sauce and red pepper flakes on the lack of flavor. It's okay to go to a restaurant with many Yelp reviews. Living up on that hype at least once which I did. I tried it once, and I won't go back to this place again. Little Tokyo is an amazing place with many other amazing ramen restaurants. It was sad to see other restaurants in that block were empty and this overhyped ramen place is packed with people waiting outside. Please give other places a chance and save that 1 hour wait!",3
"OMG!!!!! (Insert anime face with tears) My mind and stomach will NEVER be the same again. I had the BEST RAMEN EVER!!!! Where to start...... We got Gyoza, Takoyaki and Daikoku Ramen Combo (We got Tsukemen). The combo comes with salad (dressing is to DIE FOR!!!! Get it!). Small Shredded Pork (yum yum). And Ramen. I must go again!!!!! I want more. I actually still have leftovers but I want more. Ramen for days!!!! The wait is very long. Come early. Come hungry.",5
"I waited 45 minutes for a counter spot late Sunday afternoon. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This was my 2nd time here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think it's good, but not the best. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not really worth the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Honestly, I think Santouka at Mitsuwa is just as good if not better.I just ordered the Daikoku Ramen and also a shredded pork side bowl that I ended up taking home....Portions are huge. Just have to say...try to eat your ramen properly! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Please do not eat it like pasta! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Use the spoon and slurp! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is a way different experience and will taste better.",4
This is one of my personal favorite ramen places to go to! Everything I've eaten here is superb. The only downfall is the wait...but it's worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Get the Daikokuya ramen with a side of fried rice and you won't be disappointed.,5
The place was cute and small. The food was ok. The ramen wasn't all the hype but the Katsudon was very tasty! It was almost just as yummy as home cooked katsudon.,4
"Is it worth the wait? YES! This place is CHEAP for its portion. $10 for Daikoku ramen with soft boiled egg and charbroiled pork sliced with veggies is well worth it and the portion is huge. I got a combo with a small bowl of chicken donburi and salad (sauce is bomb!!!) for an extra $4 with my ramen! I don't usually like very salty broth and I felt like it was a perfect rich amount of broth (if that makes sense). Don't forget, CASH only!",5
"As ramen lovers, my BF and I have been meaning to try Daikokuya for about a year now but just weren't able to get around to it until now. Usually when we walk past, there is a line out the door and down the sidewalk and we just don't have time to wait. Awesomely enough, this time there was ZERO line and we were able to be seated immediately if we sat at the counter. We took the hostess up on that offer, not wanting to wait around for a table. This turned out to be a mistake. The corner I stupidly chose to sit in was very warm, my stool was wobbly, and there was a cloudy glass panel right in front of my face. The counter did not have much space for food which I should have considered before we sat down. Our waitress was very nice (and spoke Japanese, which was nice!) but seemed to be in quite a hurry, presumably to get everyone out the door before the dinner rush came. In turn, we felt a bit rushed. It was also VERY difficult to get our server's attention for anything. For instance, my BF ordered extra bean sprouts but they brought bamboo instead and it took quite awhile to get someone's attention so that we could get the correct vegetable. The food was pretty decent! I will admit that it is not the best ramen I have ever had, though. The gyoza was very strange. They were all cooked together into something that resembled a patty or omelette and were topped with green onions. They were pretty tasty but the presentation was odd and some of them ripped open as we tried to tear them apart. If I had to rate the ramen on a scale of 1-5, I would give it a 3. I do like that you can order a half portion because I can never finish a full size bowl of ramen. The broth a noodles were decent. I loved the sweet corn that came in it and even asked for extra. The egg (a miso egg, I believe) had to be my favorite part, though. I was a bit skeptical because when I first went to bite into it, I noticed that it was cold. I let it sit in the broth for a bit and it was good to go. The yolk was gooey and absolutely delicious. Overall, we had an okay experience. I wasn't blown away but it wasn't terrible either. We may be back or we may not.",3
"Yaaaaas! This place is so good! The wait will be long, but the ramen is good, the takoyaki and the dumplings are all amazing choices. Everything is sooo fresh. I had the dipping cold ramen and I will let you know it's worth it for those hot summer days.",5
Chashu = 4/5Service = 4/5Cleanliness...yikes!Will not return to this location =(,2
"The ramen is pretty good, don't get me wrong. The hype... doesn't help the ramen. My girlfriend and I waited for an hour and half to eat, not a problem, complete understood the wait time. However with such a wait time, you'd think it would be worth the wait, sadly it wasn't amazing amazing. The hype was a complete disservice to the quality of this ramen.",3
"I totally underestimated this place as only reason for many reviews for this place is that is is located in Little Tokyo; however, they do definitely serve some very good ramen here! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_By the way, if you are expected to wait in line for an extended period of long time, it may be a good idea to stroll around Little Tokyo for 30-40 minute after listing your name on the waiting list. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_By the time when you return, they should be ready to seat you at any minute.My wife and I have ordered a ramen with some extra noodles, and the amount was sufficient to feed both of us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their noodles and soup taste comparable to ones sold in Japan, and the generous amounts of green onions are a major plus as well. Obviously, you will be ordering your ramen here, but I also strongly suggest to order their gyoza (pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings) as it is surprisingly very very good!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I can honestly say that they maybe serving one of the BEST gyoza in US , and you may also include Japan as well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is a MUST so please please try! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Their service is excellent as servers are very courteous and generous. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that ramen soup was warm, but not hot. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I am not sure if it has anything to do with too many liability lawsuits in US, but other than that, you will definitely have a very good dining experience here!",4
"As soon as approaching this restaurant there was a line outside, so I figured this was the place to be. Sure enough, I left extremely satisfied. Service was great and food came out fast! Fish was so fresh and tasty. I had salmon sashimi and spicy tuna roll. I got the original ramen bowl. Broth was delicious, not too salty and full of savory flavors. Next time I'm in LA, I will be returning.",5
"Great noodles. Chicken is fatty af, so ""authentic."" Expect to wait an hour for a table, enough time to check out the neighborhood shops. WORTH THE WAIT! Less wait at the off hours, lunch and dinner will cost 2 hours of your life",5
"Part of the lure is the line up in front of this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So we went and we waited. Service: exceptional and attentive. I admire a place that can handle a large crowd of waiting people. They even made a few flight missteps when calling people on the list, and owned the issue. Food: Really good flavors with all their food. Only issue found was that the spicy was not very spicy.",4
"So so so delicious . ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Worth to wait for the long line for a Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ordered the miso spicy base and tried the pork base from my friend, the pork base soup definitely a star of this place.",5
"Daikokuya is the bomb spot for some really good Ramen. I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen Combo, the Broth was so rich in flavor and the meat was so tender was like butter not to mention the soft boiled egg! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I also really liked the side salad and the Pork Cutlet.",4
"Worth the wait - no matter how long. They have the best ramen and Katsudon. It is difficult to find Katsudon at restaurants, but theirs tastes like you are in Japan. Thank you so much. You can also buy their salad dressing that they serve, and it is a must. Will be back soon.",5
"Best ramen in California!!! This is a small restaurant but it is a must for everyone coming to Little Tokyo. We went during an off hour and was able to get a table right away. During busy hours, the wait could be 45min to 1 hr. CASH ONLY!!!  We all ordered the Daikokuya ramen and in half serving size ($7.50). It was definitely more than enough for us. The broth is not too heavy or oily. Noodles were cooked perfectly and the meat is tender and juicy. Got extra nori on the side. Definitely would go back again to try any of their other ramen!!!",5
"Tiny ramen jewel located in Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you're in a rush, this might not be the restaurant for you. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The restaurant has very limited, cramped seating...but it's BIG on taste! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My LA local friend took us here because my boyfriend wanted ramen.When you walk in, immediately find the wait list book and write your name down. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This lets the staff know who is next for an open table. Optimal seating is or parties 1-4 people; and larger and you'll probably be waiting a long time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It took about 30 minutes for my group of 4 to get seats along the kitchen wall.I ordered the combination Daikoku ramen bowl plus a small teriyaki eel bowl, which together cost $20.50. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's a great deal because it's a lot of food, and I got to try different things on the menu.The ramen was flavorful and filling. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The boiled egg was my favorite part, and it had a lot of broth, which I prefer when eating ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I asked for the kotteri flavor, which adds a more fatty flavor to the broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Bowls are made to order, so if you want to customize your ramen, just tell the server.The eel bowl was absolutely my favorite dish. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The eel was sweet and moist, and I chewed without catching any bones. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would've been happy eating just the rice bowl, definitely order it if you are an eel fan!!Daikokuya isn't a place to linger, so once you're done eating, pay your bill and go because there is surely a line of other people waiting for their turn to eat this yummy food!",4
"The Best spicy ramen soup, and they were vegan ,, i will definitely be back.. If you do not mind waiting ,, it is a must ..",5
"We got there before 6pm as some yelpers recommended. Short wait for two! However, the place is very tiny and we were seated in the bar area right next to the stove which made it very very warm on a summer evening. Our meal came out quick. Between my bf and I, we shared the combinaction with their signature ramen and the shredded pork bowl. The pork bowl was delicious! There is an option to add extra fat to the soup.. sounds gross, but I might actually try that next time we are in the area. But the portion was just right for us to share since we don't eat much. We'll be back!",4
"While visiting LA, I made sure to visit Daikokuya which is one of the best ramen spots in LA and also on numerous top 10 lists. I arrived a few minutes before when it opened because I had heard about the hour long waits which are the worst when I'm hangry, haha! I ordered Daikokuya's signature ramen which was absolutely AMAZING. Very comparable to NYC's #1 ramen spot Ippudo. The noodles were soft just the way I like them, broth was TASTY and pork belly chashu was so chewy! I definitely prefer this place over Shin-sen-gumi. I recommend coming here right when it opens. All seats were full 10 minutes after opening with a line forming outside the door when I left. Boy this place was popular!",5
"Perhaps I over-hyped myself about this restaurant. I've heard everyone say Daikokuya is the best ramen and that the food is excellent. We ordered their famous ramen and an appetizer of takoyaki. The takoyaki arrived first, but was not hot at all, it was room temperature and you could tell it had been sitting there for a while. The filling mix however was not bad, it was pretty good. The ramen for me is another story, I honestly didn't find it amazing or that good as people say. There were very few toppings and the soup broth tasted watered down and bland. The noodles were slightly overcooked and too soft. I think this place is overrated.",3
"Finally got to try Daikokuya after being scared away by the lines countless times !! We went at 3 on a Tuesday &amp; there were actually ~empty tables~ !! We were actually in Little Tokyo for a different restaurant but couldn't pass up this opportunity. I'm glad we didn't because the ramen was sooo yum!! I loved the soup (original and spicy miso) &amp; must say it was much more flavorful/better flavor than Shin Sen Gumi. Also the pork belly was sooo tender and flavorful and delicious. The one thing that I slightly didn't like was how thick the ramen noodles were. They were a little hard also so it made it a little difficult to chew. However, it was still overall as amazing as they say it is! **Don't forget CA$H ONLY! The bill added up quite quickly too just fyi**",5
Went here with a friend today around 3:00 PM. There was only a five minute wait. We both had the spicy miso ramen which was divine. The broth was perfect and the pork was melt in your mouth yummy. I would stop here again for sure the next time I'm in the area.,5
"I've been to this place about 10 times and never have I been disappointed!! It's not easy waiting but expect it, and plan accordingly so that you're not standing outside on a sidewalk, starving for 2 hours... (Maybe bring a snack or eat something small beforehand)Either way, you'll have no problem finding an appetite once the food comes out!My favorite is the spicy ramen combo (with the pork) and I add chili powder to make it sizzle... Sooo good! Worth the wait is an understatement. You'll want to finish your food and get out, because the traffic never seems to stop. But nonetheless I'd recommend this place to anyone and I'll definitely be back the next time a craving calls!",4
"Came here during our visit in L.A. The line was pretty long, me and my boyfriend had to wait for at least half hour. By the time we got our table, it was already dawn. We ordered the original and spicy ramen. We have a high expectation on these ramen because this restaurant is rated as one of the best ramen place in L.A.. However, it taste a bit ordinary, not thing too special. But anyway, it's still good and will definitely come back here next time when we visit L.A. again!",4
"The ramen and rice bowls here are delicious. I got the Daikokuya ramen with a small bowl of fried rice. The broth of the ramen was awesome. It was very rich that gets you full pretty quickly but not rich in a sense that it's fatty and greasy. Also, they give you a whole egg as opposed to half which was a big plus for egg-lover like me. Another thing to note about is their chashu. It's very fatty and tender and is probably the MVP of the bowl. The fried rice was also the star of the night. Usually it's hard to make such a simple dish into something really good but Daikokuya did not fail to do so. Not sure what they did but the fried rice here is extra aromatic and instantly boosts your appetite.This place is so good that I believe is worth an hour wait. However, I'm not really sure if it's amazing enough for a two hour wait. Service wasn't the greatest but they are fast and efficient in order to accommodate the crazy amounts of customers they have waiting in front of the store. Will definitely come back if I have some time to kill.",4
This was my first time here! The food was definitely worth the wait and the waiters were super nice! I'm so happy that we made the choice to eat here! I'll definitely be back and bringing some more friends! Thank you Daikokuya Little Tokyo!!,5
"Even though I came in the middle of the week and towards the end of lunch rush, there was still quite a bit of wait time. The place is really tiny and super crowded and the ground/tables are slanted. Additionally, the room smelled a little bit but it went away as the food was brought to our table. Luckily it came very quickly. The broth was really rich and flavorful but salty towards the end as it cooled down. The noodles were a little undercooked towards the beginning but that wasn't a huge deal since I just let them cook in the broth for a while before I began eating. Overall, it was a pretty decent bowl of ramen.",4
"Be prepared to wait in line. We came on a Monday around 2:30pm and still waited 30ish minutes.We ordered takoyaki ball, spicy garlic ramen and the Daikokuya ramen. The takoyaki balls were just super regular takoyaki balls - nothing special and sadly their ginger was dyed. The spicy garlic ramen was very well flavoured and the ramen was perfectly cooked and wasn't too thick or thin (held on the soup very well!)The service was great, everyone there was super friendly and attentive. It's a small ramen place so be sure to come not during lunch/dinner rush. I would definitely come back in the future.",4
"I remember coming here in 2007 when there was no line. Today you have to wait over 45 minutes to get in. That's how awesome this place is! I've been to many ramen places in LA and Hawaii, this is in my top 3 ramen places. I usually have gotten the combination of ramen and rice bowl. Food: 5/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 5/5Worth the wait? Yea!Would I come here again? Yes!Would I bring my friends here? Yup!",5
"I had the Vegan Spicy Ramen and let me tell you...as a ramen enthusiast, this, in fact, is the best ramen dish ever. I've been to many ramen places this year and I thought I found the one but oh how I was wrong. This is officially my top ramen spot. Arigato Daikokuya for adding in the Vegan options! The broth was very creamy, thick and very rich in flavor. A friend and I went at 10 a.m. to avoid wait time but there was already a line forming so we waited roughly 15 minutes so be prepared to wait which shouldn't be a big deal because you're next to Japanese Village Plaza. 11/10 would recommend to anyone!",5
"Ehhh. Honestly, I just wasn't super impressed with their Ramen. It was ok but all of the great reviews made me want to try this place out. The ramen tasted very basic and there was nothing special about it. The service was really quick and friendly. Also, make sure you bring cash because it's a cash only business.",3
"6317. At the time of my review, this first and original location of Daikokuya has 6317 reviews, and I have to wonder when this place is going to hit 10,000, just like all the Y2K predictions said the Dow would hit 10,000 when the millennium arrived.Word of mouth says this is the best ramen spot in LA, and being new to the city, I got to try it twice in the last week. I tried both versions of their standard daikoku ramen: kotteri style (with extra pork back fat) and regular.Here's the low down:1) Find this place by spotting its bright yellow awning and the crowd of people waiting outside. When I arrived on a Friday at 615PM, I was seated within 20 minutes, surprisingly, although I was alone. My second time, my friend and I went on a Monday at 7:30PM -- we thought we would be doomed with a long wait, but we were seated in under 10 minutes! There's an app called Bounce that tells you what the current wait time is at the Little Tokyo (and Sawtelle) locations of Daikokuya, but it's not really reliable. Just show up and I promise it's worth the wait!2) Parking: the street meters right in front surprisingly open up around 7:30PM and there is no charge after 8PM. Otherwise it was like $3 an hour. Your best bet is to park in the Japan Village mall parking structure directly across the street, where the charge is $3 for up to 2 hours and you'll be able to easily find a spot.3) Write your name down as you arrive and listen for them to call your number. There are probably ten seats inside for waiting, but expect to stand outside and don't go too far.4) If you don't want to bother, directly next door there is another ramen place that doesn't have a wait (heard good things but haven't tried it) and a well-regarded udon place that makes its own noodles fresh.5) Friendly service, especially from that one hip waiter!6) Extremely quick to get your food after you order, probably about 10 minutes7) Huge portion with lots of perfectly al dente chewy curly noodles, a FULL soft-boiled egg (not half), plenty of bean sprouts, scallions and a little bit of bamboo shoots for only $10. Add-ons such as corn, butter, more sprouts are 50 cents to $1 and if you want either extra broth or noodles the charge is $2.50. I did feel I would have like a bit more broth but it was just about right.8) Not only delicious but probably one of the better $ values in town. Many LA ramen places only give you soup and noodles to start and you have to add the egg and toppings and you could end up paying $15 easily for a bowl of ramen whereas Daikokuya gives you everything you want for $10. Many other places only give you half an egg if they do at all. Also I want to note that while the broth is salty, I don't think they use MSG because I'm very sensitive to it.9) The handmade gyoza was amazing! Nice brown crust on the bottom that connected the chive and pork dumplings, all served bottom side up. I've had this a lot at Japanese and Chinese restaurants but this was probably one of the best I've had outside of an exclusive dumpling joint. It is best when it arrives and still is hot enough to nearly burn the roof of your mouth.10) I much preferred the standard daikoku pork broth without the extra fat in the kotteri style as the kotteri style is definitely more oily although more flavorful. 11) Cash only and there are signs everywhere to remind you. There's an ATM inside or go next door to the little gift shop and make a small debit card purchase with cash back.12) There are now 4 locations so if you're not near downtown LA you can check out the newest one on the Westside in the Sawtelle district, or hit up the locations in the more Chinese-leaning neighborhoods of Arcadia and Monterey Park.By the time I finish writing this review, I'll bet the number will be up to 6320.",5
There's no doubt the Ramen here was good but the thing that isn't worth coming back here is the slow service. Not to mention the very rude staff who assisted us. She can't even get my orders right. Wth. What a very disappointing experience that was.,3
"Pretty Pretty Good,I was in town for a convention, and I wanted to try Ramen down here, so my sister and I decided to check this out. Every time I've passed by there's always a line. When we visited, we only had to wait about 30 minutes. Located across the main shopping center in Little Tokyo, you'll find this restaurant. It's not too big, a bar on one side, a couple booths on the other. Once we were in, we were greeted by one of the nicest waiters I've seen in a while. I forgot his name, but he seemed very enthusiastic about his work.Today, I ordered the Daikoku Ramen, Gyoza, and a beer. It didn't take much time for everything to roll out. The Gyoza was delicious. First time where I've seen it fried in whatever that was, cheese? Probably not, but they were unique. Make sure you have it with the sauce they provide! The Daikoku Ramen was very rich and filling. I'm a big fan of tonkatsu flavored broths and this was exceptional. The broth was 'thicker' than what I was accustomed to, but it was unique and welcomed. The noodles were firm. Porkbelly was delicious. And the rest all formed a good dish.Whenever I'm in the mood for Ramen when I'm in town, I will definitely come back.",5
"Got the spicy miso soup ramen. I expected the soup itself to be ""spicy"" hence the name but it wasn't. Not a big fan of ramen but decided to eat here. There was about a 20 minute wait for 2 people. Understandably, the place is small so there was a waitlist. Nonetheless I would give this place a 4/5.",4
"On a hot Monday night, waited 30 minutes (-arrived at 6 pm) because the first offer was at bar and it was too broiling hot sitting there so we said we'd wait for a tableYeah!, the table was perfect, glad we waited. It was right by the door and we felt a ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_cool breeze. The second time we came, it was a cooler day and we sat at a table towards the back, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_but again way TOO HOT in here. So I have to ding a star. It's uncomfortable and the only place you can tolerate it is a table by the door, just barely. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Don't go in the summer, on a hot day, or on any day where ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_temp is over 70 degrees!We really only wanted a draft beer cause we had a late lunch, but we ended up ordering the ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_roast pork appetizer and the gyoza. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Both were excellent. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The draft beer arrived in cold mugs. Heavenly.We came back two days later ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_for their ramen and sausage appetizer. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The sausage was awesome. While I liked the ramen, I've had better. It was nothing special.Service was super nice and efficientThere's a great vibe here. We flew in from San Francisco this morning and ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_made a special trip out to Koreatown for lunch and we hated that restaurant. We get back to our hotel, miyako, and notice all the people lined up outside ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_this restaurant, and we think it must be good, let's go get a beer and we end up loving the restaurant we could walk to in one minute vs the restaurant that took three hours out of our day (at least I could go to Nature Repulic and stock up in a bunch of aloe)",4
"Had hot sake, the house special noodle bowl and tonkatsu. This tiny joint, little hole in the wall always lives up to its reputation. The wait is always worth it.",4
"New noodles for the new year! Happy 2016 everybody!It seems fitting to have ramen/noodles to ring in the new year and that's exactly what I did on January 1st of this year. After a slow and semi-rough start due to the previous night's festivities, I hauled my ass down to Little Tokyo to participate in the blessing and tieing of fortunes at the local temple. Parking this day was horrendous. With lots gauging their prices at $20 and beyond, I luckily found street parking but a considerable distance away. Our first stop was Daikokuya to put our name down because from the look of the growing crowd outside, we had quite awhile to wait. One temple, a few blessings and 1.5 hours later, we made it back just in time for our name to be called! Now, I've been here many times in my undergrad days and this visit did not disappoint. My favorite on the menu is their ramen combos with donburi. I chose a tonkatsu/pork cutlet and was very impressed with the taste and flavor of the donburi.Overall, there is little that can be said about this joint that already hasn't been said. It's amazing and will always remain one of my favorite ramen stops in LA!",5
"I came here after reading all the good reviews and figured this many people couldn't be wrong. However, I wasn't super impressed. First off, their signature ramen. It had a nice light broth, good noodles cooked al dente, whole egg which was delicious - wish they had cut it in half though, and amazing pork. Honestly I think the pork was the best part. However, I was not a fan of bean sprouts and bamboo in my ramen. I think it kinda flavored the broth too much and i just didn't like it. I prefer my ramen with seaweed and maybe mushroom slivers, but not bean sprouts. Also, they were a little heavy handed on the green onions. Secondly, I came here on a wed night at 5pm. They already had a few people waiting. The waiting list just sits on a table, and even if you're a single person that just wants to sit at the bar, they don't really notice you. I put my name on the list and politely waited only to notice that another guest was immediately escorted to the bar since she was by herself. I got up and had to grab a waiter who talked to the hostess (in the back of the restaurant) to come seat me at the open bar. A bit of a hassle for just one person. I would expect such a busy place to have the waiting process down like a science. The rest of my meal was fine. Do bring cash as they have like 10 signs around the restaurant reminding you that they only take cash. Also they do have about 10 seats on either side of the entrance for waiting. The whole dining room area has about 8 booths of 4 ppl and a bar that can seat about 10 people.",3
"This place is good, I can see why people wait forever to eat here. I'm no ramen ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_expert, so I'm not gonna go into details. The broth was tasty, the pork was tender, and the noodles were cooked al dente. I probably won't be coming back soon because there was too many people waiting to get in, and I get hangry.",5
"I don't understand why people are calling this the best ramen place in Little Tokyo. We've had way better for cheaper and this place is dirty. A bug crawled on the wall next to me as I was eating ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food I self was ok, nothing to write home about. Definitely not worth the long wait times.",2
"Excellent ramen, and everyone there is nice. SUPER long line to get in, make sure you have time to spare if you're not going alone. Otherwise, there is often space at the bar.",5
Got lucky as we came in before the dinner rush. Service was incredible and everyone is super nice. Great customer service. We ordered and got our food within 5 minutes...and Food was delicious.,5
"Best Ramen in LA! The line is usually super long in Downtown, but the less congested locations are a great alternative.",5
"Hands down my favorite ramen spot. There is usually a line, so put your name down and be ready to wait...or head two doors down and grab a drink at Far East bar. I preferring do the latter Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€ºÃƒÂ§ But trust me the food is worth the wait. Don't forget to ask for a salad, their house made dressing is legendary",5
"This place is super yummy!!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have tried a lot of ramen places and I have to say this is the only place that has a 10/10 on soup and 10/10 on the noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You know most ramen places are great on one or the other. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But this place does it right. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We order the Diakokuya and Spicy Miso ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have to say that either one ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_was not a disappointment at all. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Spicy isn't really that spicy, so you need to ask for real spicy if you like spicy food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their portion size is prefect, not too huge and enough to fill you up if you are super hungry. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food came out within minutes after we order it, it made the wait worth it.We came on a Tuesday afternoon, they are mildly busy. One gripe is corn and seaweed is extra. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Wish it came with it like a combo thing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But I would sill come back here anytime for lunch.*FYIBring CASH",4
"Very busy. Line is always long although if you come right at their opening time, you can grab one of the places at the bar. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ramen is amazing with choices of different toppings. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Home made dumplings are really great as well.",4
"Service was horrible they want to rush you when you're ordering. This place is rated very highly and a recommended spot on different websites, but the broth tastes and looks like grungy water from the sewer. Their pork belly is tasteless and has a disgusting texture to it. Not worth visiting and waiting if you want to have good ramen.",1
"I had heard a lot about the quality of Daikokuya ramen, so my brother and I did the whole 30 minute wait-thing and I have to say, I don't know if it was worth the wait.The ramen was absolutely solid delicious ramen, no complaints about the quality at all. But I can't say it was better than other places that I enjoy. And to make it extra annoying, it's cash only.Look, good ramen, totally worth eating, but the lower score is because the wait is silly when you can go other places for just as good of ramen elsewhere and you can use your credit card.",3
"Back in LA! Daikokuya was our first stop for dinner last night. We had an hour and a half wait, but decided to go across the street to Nirvana Bar and have a couple of drinks there. (Side note: that place really transports you to the world of dungeony karaoke bars. And the garlic edamame is legit good.)We got the Daikoku bowl and the Spicy Miso, and definitely liked the latter better even though both had nice broths. The noodles were wonderfully firm, but neither bowl had much meat. Very good, but not enough to justify the wait. Our server was awesome and extremely accommodating. Dunno. We're not ramen aficionados, but it seems that Tatsu-ya back in Austin is just as good. Hey--at least we tried it!",4
"Love the food by Daikokuya , the three stars is for its location and parking...not necessarily the service or food itself. Little Tokyo is insanely busy all the time, if you come to this location: be prepared to wait a good two hours. The food is delicious and the best ramen I have ever had. I wish they would add more tables and staff but the space is small. Overall, I go to their other locations more.",3
"Definitely one of the best ramen spots in Sawtelle. The wait can be a hassle but if you have the time, definitely the spot to eat.",5
"This was my first time here. We came here on a Monday night and there was already a line outside the door. Parked our car across the street for a fee of 10$, because there's no parking anywhere. We wrote our names on the wait list and was called in no more than 25 minutes. The place was pretty small and crowded. We got the famous daikoku ramen combo, that came out about 10 minutes after we placed our order. The salad that came with the combo was tasty. The size of the bowl was huge. I thought the noodles itself was really good and had great texture. The broth was creamy and wasn't too salty. I wasn't a big fan of the side (pork cutlet) it came with because it was soggy. Service: Server was pushy and rushed us in ordering. Thumbs down for not refilling our drinks.Overall, noodles were good for a decent price.",4
"Ramen :)I am very new to ramen but i am hooked. I have been here a couple times already and i cant get enough. This location in Little Tokyo is so cool, very small &amp; always crowded but so worth the wait. Staff is very cool and very helpful. If you never had ramen before make sure you ask because there is always extra stuff you can add on to make it better then it already comes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Enjoy!",5
"Overrated noodle restaurant. Pros: 1. Noodles is great, tastes very Ã…â€™___Ãƒâ€_Ãƒâ€™.2. Sashimi tastes ok.3. Green tea is nice and it helps you get rid of the salty and oil tasting.Cons:1. Ramen soup is too salty and can't take one more spoon.2. Pork on the rice, from the combine, has one raw piece. It is too dry inside and the fried pork coat is too soft and not crispy. That's why there are 3 stars.",3
Very authentic and homey ramen. I really enjoyed the ramen and the rustic experience here. Be aware that it is cash only!,5
"One of the things that was deemed mandatory on my last trip to LA, was to seek out some good ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Two names popped up repeatedly while doing some cursory research on ramen, especially since I was staying in Little Tokyo: Daikokuya and Shinsengumi. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_While walking around, it was decided to judge books by their covers, and Shinsengumi's modernized facade shared with a Quiznos and a Starbucks wasn't as charming or promising looking as Daikokuya's hole-in-the-wall appearance, not to mention the huge group of people all waiting to get in. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So we decided to put our name on the list and wait out Daikokuya, which was fine by me since I'd been drinking and a little time to sober up and play Pokemon Go sounded appealing.You learn a lot about human behavior when waiting in a long line; for starters, if you think anyone is going to put your name down on the list for you, you're in for disappointment; thankfully I noticed only one person write their name down after me before I realized that I have to do it myself. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The way it works is that after you put your name down, you simply wait and hope to have Beethoven's hearing aid when a server will eventually softly call for your name, and quickly respond before you are deemed as ""called"" and passed over. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But, if you hear your name and respond, it's cool, otherwise, you can be a salty patron and let a hostess know ""we've been here the whole time.""Anyway, after around a 40 minute wait, my name was called, and the gf and I were seated in a cozy booth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Once seated, service is prompt, efficient, and moves like a well-oiled machine; after all, with 40 minute waits, it's definitely in their best interest to get you in, get you fed and get you out as efficiently as possible.We both ordered the Daikoku ramen, since it's the headline item, and what looks like the iconic item of the restaurant. To no real surprise, it came pretty quickly, as I have to imagine that with the sheer volume of ramen that gets ordered, there's probably a massive amount in ready for orders.The broth is savory and meaty in flavor, and I appreciate that they don't skimp on choshu. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The portion is pretty generous in size, as well as how much stuff like bamboo shoots and the volume of noodles you get inside of it.Overall, I have to say that I can't say that I was super impressed with the ramen, though. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For as long as I waited, I would have hoped to have gotten something a little more memorable, but in all honesty, it wasn't mind-blowing or differing to separate itself from the pack. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Don't get me wrong, it's still hearty and good quality ramen, but I waited like 45 minutes and hoped for something along the lines of Ippudo and very much didn't.The location is charming and pleasant and the service is fast, polite and efficient. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I wouldn't say the food is worth waiting 45+ minutes for, but if by chance you go there and there's not a long wait, then it's probably an experience better than 3 stars waiting for you than it was for me.",3
I had vegan sesame ramen and it was one the best vegan ramen I had ..My wife had the regular Ramen and that was also very unique and opened our taste buds :),4
"Located right on the edge of Little Tokyo, it is a great spot. Parking in the area is not too bad - typical LA area with meters. You can also park a little farther, like in the Art District, and take a stroll through the area. Beware, the line does get long though, especially during prime meal times but even during off times! It's a very popular ramen joint but you can put your name down then cross the street and check out the beautiful area of Little Tokyo (be sure to check and get there before your name is up though!). They are known for their ramen and I must say that it is pretty good! I have also tried their small sushi bowls and appetizers but was not really a fan of either. The ramen however is well made and proportions are not bad! I wouldn't say it was the best ramen I've ever had but I do always come back. I would give it 3.5 if I could but rounded up to a 4 because I usually go back to let new friends try it.",4
"Wow, this place has the best ramen. I got the combination plater! I will definitely be coming back soon!",5
"I am a huge frequenter of Daikokuya in Sawtelle aka I eat it every week or two. We tried the West Hollywood location for the first time since it just opened. Ambience: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the interior is consistent with the Japanese street feel but the seats in this location is all booths with one bar. It feels a lot more like a ""luxury"" restaurant.  Taste: The ramen seems about the same. I felt like the broth was not a creamy but it could be just that day. Service: I've always felt that the service at all Daikokuya's to be excellent :) prompt and always very kind!",5
"Really disappointed with this place. I can't believe people actually wait hours to eat here. Things started off bad instantly, when the waitress put the miso soup on our table, which is so broken it's rocking around like a rocking chair, and then proceeds to spill half of the miso without given a single crap, and walks away. No attempt to clean it or fix the unbearably broken taken.The ramen broth itself was nothing out of the ordinary. Basically run of the mill for me. The pork was cold, which I couldn't believe. The egg was cooked through and had zero ooze. The overall dish was just very very ordinary, nothing I would expect from a place with such a reputation, but more like a food court. The tuna bowl was a total disgrace. The sushi quality was very low, think Ralph's grocery store. Then to top it off we swapped the rice for vegetables and that just ended up being old shredded flavorless cabbage. I've learned one thing about the LA food scene is people flock in masses to hyped restaurants. Maybe they pay off the right people to get that initial success and publicity, then just ride the hype wave to the bank. This is one of those places.",2
"Daikokuya serves one of the best kotteri ramen bowls that I've ever had. The fatty broth is so savory and delicious, adding a rich flavor to the thick noodles. The chashu is also pretty solid, as are most of the ingredients (minus bamboo which I don't really care for).I also like that you can add a small bowl for an extra ($3-5), I like the pork/chicken cutlet with egg and the fried rice here is actually really good as well.This place has remained the same for the past couple years but there is something to be said of their consistency: that's why people are still willing to wait for the few seats here. IMO nothing is as good as the kotteri tonkotsu and that's the sole reason to come to the OG little Tokyo location.",5
"Almost a two hour wait on a Tuesday night, I order the spicy miso ramen. Damn, I have never taste any broth as salty as this. I tried to lighten it up by adding 1 cup of hot water to my bowl. Nope, that didn't solve the problem. Ended up pouring 3 full cup of hot water and it barely made a difference.... I even ask the worker if they can take it back and make it less salty and they told me no.",1
"I went there because my friend went and he was raving about it. He knows I love ramen and he has pretty good taste, so ask pretty much all of my friends repeatedly until one of them finally agreed to go with me. There is always a line outside, which is kind of annoying, and they're cash only, which is also annoying, but I was determined to taste it. We got ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_two seats on the corner of the bar after waiting a bit. The place was very crowded. I ordered the Daikokuya ramen and we eventually got our food. It was a decent portion of food, so I was excited. When it tasted it, it was... well, just ""ok."" I felt like it tasted like any other ramen shop's ramen; nothing special, like my friend had made it out to be. Don't get me wrong, it was good ramen. I suppose I was just expecting more. It was also a tad on salty side, and when I wanted to make it spicy one of the cooks gave me this oil that was not actually spicy. It just added more oil to the dish and no flavor. Their other sauces also didn't offer the flavorful spice I was looking for. Overall it was a decent meal and I ate it: it just wasn't special. I don't see what all the fuss is about. I haven't even wanted to go back since. Maybe I should give it another try and see if then I will experience what everyone else is talking about?",3
"Walked over from jury duty. Food came out quick and was the same yummy quality that I'm used to at the monterey park location. This place is even more cramped. And for some reason, they didn't want to turn on the air (it was 89 degrees outside).",4
"Really good Ramen and even better chicken fried rice. The wait time is pretty long here. Waiting for a party of 3, I was able to go grab an ice cream (Bae) chill and eat that and then a doughnut (Cafe Dulce) chill and eat that and made it back just in time to pretty much be seated. We went on a Sunday around 4 and when we left still a wait outside around 6. But worth it, got a combination ramen w/ fried rice and salad. It was soo much food, enough to easily split with someone. :)",5
"My boyfriend and I found this restaurant through yelp and were shocked with how many reviews there were... We knew we HAD to try it. We got there around 545 and there was a crazy long line. We put our name down and it was a 45 minute wait. We walked around a little bit and knew we made the right choice when we saw a bunch of other ramen restaurants empty! Within seconds of being seated, we were asked what we wanted to drink and our food came out within minutes of being ordered. We ordered Gyoza which was UNBELIEVABLE! We also ordered the Daikoku Ramen, which was very filling. My favorite was the Shredded Pork Bowl. Everything was so rich tasting and was definitely the best ramen I have ever had! I cannot wait to come back here next time I'm in town!",5
Great ramen! Like was long but didn't wait more than 20 mins ! Vegan ramen wasnt what we expected. So i will stick to my regular Special,4
"This place is a STRUGGLE but.....worth it.The first time I came here was for coachella and I was stopping by to eat...there was a long line and my friends and I just really couldn't wait. It was like a 2 hour wait. The second time I came here was for dreamstate and I was again, stopping by to eat....so I was like ""NO WE MUST WAIT"". You put your name down on the list and they will come outside to call you, your entire party must be there or they won't seat you. There's like a mini shopping center area right beyond where you can get your hello kitty fix so go there to pass time. After a 2 hour waiting period we finally got called. It was crowded and hot af inside but I felt like it was super authentic like the ambiance. I got the Tsukemen- noodles and broth separated. BROTH WAS AMAZING!!!!! As soon as I dipped my noodles and pork into the broth I forgot I even waited in that long line. I didn't get the ramen and opted for the separate noodles and broth cuz I didn't want to burn my tongue...the struggles of eating too fast. The pork is FLAVORFUL and just NOMS!!!!! The egg....oh man...I don't know how they make this but I could prob eat like 6 of these. Just melts in your mouth with the broth taste....I'm like super hungry just thinking about this again.Tips:1. Always a line so just put your name down and get some boba before and wait outside. (Can't get seated without all parties so better be there when they call your name)2. CASH Only3. Broth, Pork, and Egg ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_is ON POINT4. Possibly best ramen in LA- still TBD",5
"I've. Gone probably 100x. But now it stops. Hair was found on my drink and soup. I was like wtf. N then I got it exchanged. After all they super insisted a tip. Nope. Hell naw. I lost appetite and respect for them. They just lost a valuable customer. Uncool.+ Their ingredients changed. Cheap noodles are now given out when u order the extra noodles.n their prices went up. Y there's alot of competition with the guys right next door daikokuya lost it. ,F% they should get rated a b or c by the health department. As in the condition they are now.",1
"By far my favorite ramen place! Amazing Spicy Miso! And I love the Gyoza and even the Tofu Nuggets! It is well worth whatever the wait may be, because this has to be the best ramen in Los Angeles!",5
Been wondering about this place for a while. Finally made it there on a Saturday afternoon. Rather legit ramen here. I should have gotten the House ramen but I got the Spicy Miso. A bit salty but so am I. Order of the tako-yaki was ok too but as always octo chunks were pinner. I will probably come back but only if the wait is less than 30 minutes.,4
"Awesome proportions, good for your bucks. Loonnngg wait though and cash only :(. The broth tonkotsu and the gyoza were really good. When you get there, just sign in ASAP!!*one stall only per women/men's restroom but clean :).",5
"I've eaten A LOT of ramen. Hands down daikokuya has the best broth I've ever had. Their rice bowls are tasty, too. Hate the long wait so go there in the middle of the week during off hours.",5
"This was my first little tokyo experience since moving to LA. The line was long but worth the wait. It's cash only btw! My boyfriend and I split the combo , we got ramen and a small pork cutlet bowl and salad and takoyaki. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Delicious!!!",4
"I don't even have the words to describe the food. Well, maybe... SUBLIME. We waited an hour and a half (1.5hrs) in 50 degree weather (aka/ ""Artic LA"") to sit and eat and we'd do it again! Service was expedient, courteous and professional and literally perfect. The only drawback is that it's cash only BUT I know that will help keep their costs down for customers so I can't really complain. There's also 3-4 banks literally across the street so you can get come cash if you're not packing.",5
Hands down must go to!!!! Friendly staff super delicious food. The sauce for the cabbage salad is beyond good. The ramen was very hot and had a great taste. Got the combo meal with SM shredded pork bowl. Pricey but well worth it. I dont mind paying for a meal that's well worth it! Will be my go to spot when I'm in DTLA,5
"I don't mind long waits, but at the end of the long wait - there better be something really good at the end of it. I've heard that there is almost always a group of people crowded outside of this place waiting for a bowl of ramen. So that means it must be amazing, right? Wrong. Don't get me wrong, this place is decent but it's not worth waiting two hours for. All I can say is that everything about the ramen here is just decent, not excellent. And therefore, I can't give it a ringing endorsement because a 2 hour wait means it better be excellent. The broth is good, but not great. The noodles are good, but not great. The meat and toppings are good, but not great. The egg was good, but not great, because they didn't do the soft-boiled egg perfectly. Sometimes ramen is so good that you keep going back. Some places that pop into my mind that have this quality for me are High Five Ramen in Chicago and Ramen Dojo in San Mateo. This just didn't have that effect for me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the combo, the daikoku ramen (with a side of bamboo shoots) and the small fried rice for $12.95 - some of the yelp reviews recommended that combo. That price isn't bad at all! One positive is that this was a large amount of food for one person and I wasn't able to finish most of my fried rice. So don't order the combo if you're not super hungry. Or, it would be good to share whatever came with your combo with someone else. One positive: I really liked the staff here. Unlike the place next door, which seats people at a snail's pace, the woman who manned the list of people trying to get a seat here was incredibly efficient. There's so many people waiting in line that you better get super close to her if you don't want to miss your name being called. She would say your name once outside, once inside and if you didn't speak up immediately, she'd move on to the next party. Great for the people waiting impatiently for their ramen, bad for the people who missed getting their names called. Also, our server was super nice and energetic. One other tip: I've heard that this place has multiple locations in the LA area and the other locations don't have as crazy of a wait. So it may be a better idea to check out those other locations so you don't have to wait 2 hours.",4
"Pro : omg, the ramen base is out of the world. Quick service.Con : cash only, no parking, the wait, more waiting, crowded, poor ventilation, and no reservation. BEST RAMEN OUTSIDE OF JAPAN.There you go. Eat there, it's not a hype. Do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dollars. TYou can walk there easily from the gold line, exit little Tokyo.",5
Temperature: HotWait time: Gets crowded fast! The line was 45 mins-1 hrTaste: Delicious. Be aware that the broth is creamy and not thinTexture: Noodles were perfectNoise level: NoisyService: Good. Fast and courteous,4
"Amazinggg ramen, the broth has really good flavor and the amount of pork seemed more than filling. The noodles were fresh and not over cooked or under cooked. I tried the spicy ramen with the spicy tuna sushi roll. Both were good and recommend to others who cant decide and want to try a little bit of everything. Next time I look forward to the pot stickers. IG @backpacking_rob",5
"Let me first tell you, I have been wanting to eat here for a very long time. I am in Little Tokyo once a week and the wait is always so long. I ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_finally had the opportunity to indulge a few weeks ago. It was a Thursday night and the wait was 20-25 minutes or so. My friend and I both ordered the ramen + small pork cutlet bowl combination. I was so disappointed. Was I missing something? Were my expectations too high? I wanted extra onions and they were going to charge me $.75. It was all simply mediocre. I will not be back here again.",2
The 3 star is for the salty broth and the small seatings. We had 7 people and waited for almost 1.5 hour to get a table fit for 4-5. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen was good but my broth was so salty. I normally love to drink all the soup but this one I couldn't drink much :(. There's one spot where it felt like I ate a chunk of something salty. We tried this place for the popular 6k + good reviews but to me there are better places we could've went to get better ramen and much better wait time.,3
"Loved the noodles! The spicy miso ramen taste great! Spicy enough to get a kick out of it but not so spicy that you can't enjoy the ramen. The restaurant is small so it can have long wait times, but well worth it. Overall I did enjoy the food and experience. It's a must try when you're in LA.",5
"One of the best tasting Japanese places I've been to. While the wait was long (real long) the staff was attentive and the food was great. The hot sake was good, and the tempura was legit.I had their signature dish named after the restaurant and I can see why it was the main dish. Very flavorful and delicious. The bowl was big enough to leave you full but not feel like you're sloshing around after getting up and walking around.",5
My bf said this was the best place for ramen in LA. The restaurant opened at 11am on Sunday morning but there was already a long wait at 11:08am. We got in maybe a half an hour later but it was well worth it. The ramen was amazing! We both ordered the combo and shared the fried rice and chicken and egg. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.,5
Sat at the bar. Waitress had us scoot down 10 min later. Watched multiple people that came after us get served before us. The bar area smelled bad and musty. The bar windows were caked in black mold or something. Gross. The Ramen was OK. Nothing memorable. Costs extra to add more toppings.,2
"Wow. Simply wow. My ramen standards are so high now. Sacramento got nothing on LA!! Their takoyaki is TO- DIE-FOR. My boyfriend and I waited about 20 minutes, it wasn't so bad, we were there around 1 PM on Friday. When I went inside, I literally felt like I was bathed into hot grease fat, literally! The restaurant is super cramped too, but it reminds me of videos of restaurants I've seen of Japan. Definitely felt the Japan vibe too. We had the Daikoku ramen and the Spicy Miso ramen. My boyfriend and I split and tried both of them. We had the takoyaki first, it was so hot, but so so delicious. I enjoyed the Daikoku the most, my boyfriend loved the spicy miso. Whoever, both were delicious, so so good! I can't wait to go back to LA and have this again. So worth the wait!!!",5
"When we arrived at this restaurant, we weren't greeted by anyone. We just sort of checked ourselves in and began to wait, which we knew we would be doing a lot of since there were so many people outside. Ended up waiting around forty-five minutes. Ordered the gyoza which are like pan fried dumplings. They were ok. Ordered the shiso age which was like spicy tuna wrapped in seaweed and dunked in tempura batter. They were not very good. The ramen itself was pretty good. Not the best ramen I have had however. I think I was expecting a bit more at a ramen shop in Little Tokyo with such a long wait. Probably will not be coming back because of the wait.",4
Pretty good ramen but here are many ramen places in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Maybe it was the tonkotsu that I wasn't a very big fan of the flavor. I would definitely want to try the spicy miso next time. I also disliked that it was cash only. Makes it inconvenient but they did tell us they had an atm machine in the back. You get a lot of ramen for the price you pay. It's in a really big bowl so that's a good thing if you are really hungry it's worth the money.,4
"Daikokuya has over 6,000 reviews and 4,000 pictures, wow. I first tried the Monterrey Park location and was greatly disappointed. The broth was bland.Luckily, the LA location is solid.The noodles are chewy enough, although I wish they were cooked a little less, and therefore, more chewy. The broth is light and flavorful; I prefer stronger tonkotsu broth. The star of the bowl was the fatty pork belly. Every little morsel of pork enhanced the bites of soup and noodles. The pork really brought this bowl together.We put our names down for a party of two at 8:25pm on a Wednesday night. We got seated at 9:00. It must be insanity trying to get in on the weekend!Tsujita LA vs Daikokuya:Tsujita wins. For me, it's not even close. If you prefer a lighter, subtle tasting tonkotsu broth, Daikokuya is for you. If you prefer a hearty richness that can knock you off your seat just by the smell alone, then you are like me and should try Tsujita.Enjoy.",4
"Stopped by this past weekend, there was a long wait. I don't know anything about the restaurant other than what was posted online and was in the mood for ramen. Located off the corner of 1st near the Chase bank. When I arrived it was later in the evening, but it was very busy and there were many people waiting outside to be seated.Overall pretty good, it felt very cramped inside we sat along the bar/grill area where people were coming and going. I've had other ramen at various places and it's pretty inline with them, but I wouldn't be ""poppin' a woody',(slang term for male penile erection) per se, over it like some of these other yelpers are.By the way, it's ""cash only"" similar to a Vietnamese massage parlor.",4
"I, along with my company, was disappointed when dining at Daikokuya for our very first time. We come from the bay area up in NorCal, and we prefer a lot more places up there than what we experienced here. First, the soup was pretty salty. Maybe this is conveyed as richness to fans of this place, but it simply just came off as pure saltiness to me. When served the ramen, the bowl looks like pure soup, which is great if the soup is good - but I can't finish it when it's too salty! Secondly, the egg was SO DISAPPOINTING! The yolk had no liquid at all! It's just a gooey gelatinous thing! And yes, I ate the egg right after I was served the bowl! I don't know, maybe I have too much love for the unstoppable liquid that comes from runny soft-boiled eggs. On the upside, the egg was flavored. The other thing I really appreciated was that they give a generous amount of green onions, as I love green onions. The bamboo shoots were floppy.The combination is worth getting here, as it is a set of salad, ramen, plus a rice bowl of your choosing. The salad is just 99% shredded cabbage and 1% shredded carrot with their original dressing, which is basically soy sauce flavored mayonnaise - not bad despite the description, actually. For my combination, I opted for the small shredded pork bowl, and kind of regretted not getting the fried rice because there were onions cooked with the shredded pork, and it was extremely saucy. It probably would have been better if my mouth was not already salinated from the ramen. Again, there was a generous amount of green onions, and the rice bowl itself is probably enough of a meal to a skinnier person. I was not able to finish more than a spoonful of this after eating everything else we ordered.We also had the spicy miso ramen, which tasted somewhat standard. It was not spicy, so we should have added the chili oil.For an appetizer, we had the gyoza, which are five pieces of pan-fried, homemade sticks of pork and vegetables. It was very bland, and I definitely needed to use all of the little tin cup of dipping sauce they provided. Again, the green onion garnishing this was quite generous. I'm beginning to see a pattern here. While I admire the homemade quality, it did taste as if my mother tried to make a healthier version of gyoza, purposefully omitting the unhealthy crunch aspect, and eliminating a lot of salt from the recipe.You know, I would give them another try, but I don't have high hopes from what I've tasted so far at Daikokuya. If this is the pinnacle of LA ramen, I lack interest in exploring other ramen places. Sorry SoCal, ramen does in fact seem to be better up in NorCal!",3
"Way overrated. There are way better ramen places in LA. I went to this one because it had good reviews, which I think are fake or bought. The broth was below average, noodles were average and the egg was over cooked. I tried the #1 selling items in their menu. The fried rice was burnt (unacceptable). The dumplings were below average too. They don't accept credit card and the place is not too nice but I wouldn't care if the food was awesome. The restrooms are terrible. I waited for an hour outside, which I don't mind if the food was spectacular or at least worth it, but it's totally the opposite. Totally disappointed.",1
"They have no vegetarian ramen...which sucks, for me at least. I ordered the Yakisoba with tofu and no pork belly. It was delicious. My family relayed the message of how delicious their ramen was and how much flavor filled each spoon full of broth, noodles, and pork. We waited about 25 minutes for seven of us to be seated, spread out of course. Don't expect to come here with a huge party of people and sit together. It ain't gonna to happen. Half of us sat at the bar and the older folks sat at the booth. Customer service was attentive and friendly, for the most part. I recommend trying their ramen because it looked so damn good. As I watched customers slurp their ramen noodles...I became disappointed...disappointed that I ever became a vegetarian. Please, consider adding a vegetarian ramen plate.",5
"Great service! Waited about an hour or so before we got seated for group of 4 but then again which popular place in socal doesn't make you wait. Food came out pretty fast as well. Definitely was worth the wait. They gave us salad and rice for the items we ordered but not sure if there was something wrong with the salad because it had a bitter taste to it. But other than that the ramen and eel with rice were really good. Definitely a come back again spot for the future. But out of all the ramen places in Los Angeles that I have tried so far, I believe this is the best one yet.",4
"I'm not sure if it's because I'm so spoiled by the good food I have back home, but I wasn't blown away by this place :(The spicy miso ramen WAS good, but I've definitely had better. I was expecting more, especially after having to wait 2.5 hours on an empty stomach.I suggest you put your name down and walk around Little Tokyo if it's a late night; just standing there out front can make the wait seem like forever and a day.",3
"This is probably the most average and overhyped ramen place in LA. A solid Yelp 3 stars A-OK. The best way I can think of to describe the food here is ""forgettable."" Nothing good or bad about the food really ever stands out here. I kept coming back with some obsessed friends who basically have only had ramen here, and I think people think food here is authentic because this is our impression of what authentic asian food ""looks"" like. Slightly dirty, only talk when necessary foreign waitresses, hole in the wall vibe gives off the illusion of authentic asian food. I would never come here to wait more than 10 minutes for food. And FYI, it's cash only.",3
"Cash only. Parking-street.The food is pretty much like any other. Nothing special that stands out. The spicy ramen had a nice kick to it. The food ideas overall good. The noodles were soft and chewy. The broth was thick. The staff did make us feel rushed and kept coming by to ask if we were done. We still had food in our bowls, we just weren't touching it or eating fast. Overall it was okay. Decent. I checked it off my list and probably will try other places first.",3
"Delicious ramen! I recommend the spicy ramen- I got a half a portion, as I am pretty small, so it was perfect. Had brunch here with a friend today. Friendly staff and no line if you arrive at 11 AM. I heard they have long lines later in the day, but that's always expected. My friend had the daikokuya signature ramen and loved it, too. Fair pricing and earned its reputation for best ramen in Los Angeles for sure!",5
"My friend was craving for ramen last night and I showed him this place due to the outstanding reviews so we decided to go there. Plus, it's been years that I had real ramen. The wait was an hour wait and it was no biggie since this is a very popular restaurant in Little Tokyo. My friend and I ordered the daikoku ramen and it was delicious and the food came by pretty fast. The broth was flavorful, meat was tender and the portion was worth it for the price. We also ordered it in a combo plate w/ a side of one of their specialty friend rice and salad. After eating the salad and the ramen, I did not knew that it filled me up pretty fast. I only ate a couple of bites of my fried rice and didn't knew it was a huge side portion that I expected to be so I took it to go. If your appetite is average to mild, I'd recommend to just order the ramen but if you're very hungry, you can just go for the combination.If you're craving for food around Little Tokyo and willing to wait for an hour, check this place out. I'll consider this place one of the best ramen I had so far.",5
"I haven't wrote any reviews in a very long time. It's been years. However, I have to write for this one. Food was decent, but they were already giving us a check after 10 mins of being there..we got the food at 5:40pm and we got a check by 5:50pm. What is up with that? There were a lot of people waiting to be seated so I understand but I felt like I had to rush..right when I stop eating ramen to drink some water, the waiter takes away our food..we left the restaurant around 5:55p. That was the shortest dinner I've ever had in restaurant. i will not come back for sure.",2
"The sushi was fresh, the sake selection was deep in both warm and cold, filtered and unfiltered. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The staff was well versed in the menu.",4
"Coming from the OC we expected more. Everything was subpar - broth, noodles, and meat. We much prefer our regular OC joints like Kitakata and even Fukusuke in Fountain Valley. Def would not wait and would try another spot in town. Daikokuya won't be receiving repeat business from us.",2
"Place is small, there was a crowd outside when I arrived. With 7 groups ahead of us, we were seated within 30 minutes. We just walked around Little Tokyo in the downtime.RECOMMENDATION: the Daikokuya ramen with the added kotteri (free add-on). The fat adds amazing flavor to the already well-flavored broth. Noodles were on the firmer side. Soft-boiled egg was perfect. An overall absolutely delicious bowl of ramen for $12. Comparable to other ramen shops like Santouka and Hakata Ikkousha. 10/10 would come back.",5
"The Daikoku ramen is so delicious! I order extra bamboo shoots and they don't skimp on those either. The egg was pleasantly boiled and it was my first time trying an egg that soft lol. We also ordered takoyaki and it's very hot and fresh. Very delicious. However, it is always packed so I recommend writing your name down and perhaps going to the plaza for a while to spend some time if your name is way down on the list.",5
"This place was added to one of my favorite ramen spots ever. They only have 3 different kinds of ramen and that's okay. I got the daikoku ramen. I thought I was going to need more meat so I ordered extra, but the meat included in the ramen turned out to be enough. Noodle-to-soup portion was also perfect. We also ordered the gyoza; one of the most stuffed gyozas I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the small pork cutlet bowl to make it a combo with his ramen. That was also delicious, but we had more than enough food so we had some leftover. I recommend asking for the spicy oil to add to your ramen if you enjoy a little kick in your soup. We're definitely going to make more trips to LA just for this spot. Watch out for parking though! It could be tricky since the area is crowded so be prepared to pay. The area is nice to go around anyway so you'll have that to explore before/after you eat.",5
"The best ramen!!! The restaurant not so much....Unfortunately they no longer offer their lunch combo special, which I loved. Hope Daikokuya brings the specials back. Other down sides to this place: the wait is real, cash only, no takeout, and the service needs some work....ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ what keeps me coming back you ask.... spicy miso ramen and the shredded pork bowl combo is the best!!! It also comes with a cabbage salad dressed in a delicious dressing (of their own concoction). The broth has great flavor and the noodles are the perfect texture. The ramen itself is 5 stars but the restaurant itself 3, for a final rating of 4 stars.",4
"A little far out of my way, I wanted a lunch date with my wife and daughter. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait was about 30 minuites but not too bad. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ended up getting the counter which was kind a bummer. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got the Spicy Miso, my wife had the Daikokuya Ramen and my daughter had the Pork Cutlet. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You are not getting any complaint from me or my ladies. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Well done, Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Thanks for the hospitality!",5
"I love their spicy miso ramen here, it's spicy and flavorful!!! I get extra green onion with mine to pump it up some more! It's banging here!",5
"This place ALWAYS has a wait!! The place is pretty small and it sucks during the summer time because there's no AC?? :( so you have to eat your ramen in the heat. So if you come to visit, be prepared to wait and bring cash with you cause it's cash only!! If you're looking for ramen that'll fill you up, Daikokuya will do it! The broth is really rich and flavorful, but it gets to the point where it's so rich that it'll fill you up pretty quickly! My favorite part about Daikokuya is the combo plate! You can get a bowl of ramen and a bowl of rice for ~$15, depending on which rice bowl you order! I always to-go my rice bowl to eat for later nom nom ~ As for the ramen texture, the noodles are definitely softer than Shin Sen Gumi's noodles, so it just depends on your own preferenceI think this is place is definitely worth a visit if you've never tried it, just cause the quality of the ramen is so good, but besides that.. I wouldn't wait more than 30 min for this place LOL I'm just not that big a fan of super rich broths",4
Best Ramen!! Awesome service!! Only down side is that they take cash only and there's always a wait time but it's worth it!! Service is quick. Food is delicious and their fried rice is to die for!!,5
"This place is an honest and popular ramen shop in Little Tokyo (be forewarned there are multiple locations for this restaurant, so don't go to the wrong one if meeting up with a friend!). The food is great and the location is great, hence the 1-2 hour waiting time.The alcohol/beer is a little pricey but the ramen is great. The ramen bowls are large, so come on an empty stomach!",4
"After a long day at universal studios, we came by for some ramen. I was starving at this point, and the wait was about an hour. After waiting, our party of 7 was seated separately as they can't really accommodate a group that size at this location. Of course when you're hungry, what do you do, you order too much. Our table for 4 ordered 4 ramen, one tempura, beef bowl, 2 sushi rolls, one gyoza, and one sashimi set..... waaaay too much food. I only tried the gyoza, tempura, and ramen. I was very full, but the ramen wasn't as tasty as I was hoping it would be. It comes in a large bowl that is half filled, loaded with green onions (yum). There is garlic you can add on the side which I love, I put two heaping spoonfuls in there after I drank half the broth. I ordered the extra fat broth, but unfortunately, the broth felt a little bland to me. I liked everything else, but I've definitely had. Enter ramen. It wasn't horrible, and I guess it's decent for the 1 hour wait, but I don't feel like it's a must have.",4
Long linesOverpricedWas good years ago but ramen has come a long way in LA,2
"The sign on the window said closed,but they were open! So come on in. First off, cash only!! They do have an atm in the back and only charges $1.50 compared to other atm's in LA are $2-3. Service is really quick and attentive. We asked for a booth,but she said it was meant for parties of 3-4. There was two couples sitting in two other booths so we were confused why she denied us. Even after we were seated at the bar, more parties of two were able to sit at the booths. By the way, it was 4pm with no dinner rush at the time. Spicy miso ramen was good! Definitely taste the house made noodles and broth. The chasu was super fatty and hard to chew. Not bad for a first timer.",3
"Great ramen place in the heart of Little Tokyo. The ambience of the restaurant is very casual and not flashy. This is the place you go to for the food not the atmosphere. The service was fast and the restaurant is cash only. I ordered the spicy miso ramen. It was good. Not incredibly spicy, it was very mild. The noodles, hard boiled egg and broth were good. My only complaint was the pork. It was way too fatty. Every bite of the pork was a mouth full of fat. I may have had 2 tiny bites of the pork meat. The rest of it was all fat and this piece of pork was the size of the palm of my hand. My friend ordered the classic ramen and she also had a piece of pork that was all fat.Overall this ramen joint was good but the pork was too fatty for my taste.",4
"Unimpressed. Had high expectations coming in due to the ratings &amp; # of reviews. Waited for about 30 mins for a party of two. Ramen was lukewarm... Who likes lukewarm ramen?! Would not return. I've had much better ramen. Also, waitresses did not appear happy working... Weren't friendly at all.",2
"My hubby and I went here on a Tuesday late night (around 10pm) as we were in the area. We were pretty lucky with the street parking although we did circle the street a couple times waiting for an empty spot. Outside the door, we saw a sign saying cash only. Made a note to self not to over order. We waited maybe 10minutes and ate on the tiny bar area as those were the only seats available. We had a view of the large cauldrons across the frosted-ish glass. It was hawt! Don't sit there unless you are starving and desperate. The booths look more comfortable.Perhaps it was because we were hungry, or maybe it was the prompt service, but as soon as I had a slurp of that daikokuya ramen I got it. There was no choir singing in my head but I was pleasantly surprised with my soupy noodles. I tried my hubby's spicy miso ramen, and it tasted like spicy miso ramen. Hubby thinks it's good, but not that different from others he had. There wasn't really anything special about that apart from maybe the noodles having a nice texture and taste, but broth is same as elsewhere. We both agreed my plain daikokuya ramen stands out from everything we've tried in LA thus far (which really isn't a lot, me thinks).We paid $30 for the 2 noodles, 1 beer, tax +tip. Needless to say, we were stuffed and chuffed. As we drove home, we both agreed we may come back if in the area, craving ramen and there's no queue. Kinda curious what else they have to offer...",5
"I really loved the food here. It was delicious. Most of the servers were really nice, but I was occasionally ignored when I asked for service.",4
"I got here around 7pm on a Thursday and there was already a small wait, about 6 people ahead of us but we only waited about 15-20 min which wasn't too bad.The place is very small and cramped so you don't really get the choice of sitting at the bar or table. The ladies working there seemed very unhappy and angry to be working but the gentleman who took our order was nice. I don't mind too much as this is an asian place. CASH ONLY.The food came out really quick! We ordered the gyoza which I think they made themselves seeing the was it was wrapped and the signature ramen. Both I thought was good. The ramen noodle had a very good texture, soup base good, chasu a little too fatty for me. I asked to add corn to mine and they gave a bowl of it on the side which I was able to share. I see people complaining about long wait times but they seem to work pretty fast so turnover shouldn't be too bad if people didn't sit and ate too long. Overall I would recommend this place.",4
The soup is too salty and the pork is too chewy and tastes porky. The price is reasonable. I came here because of the exceptional reviews and rating of the restaurant but the food quality is not as good as I expected.,3
This place is so good! It's the best ramen I've had. There is always a line here but it's honestly so worth the wait. There isn't a line for nothing! The place is really small and it gets super hot but you get your food pretty quickly. This place takes cash only but there's a Chase right across the street. Also there's a parking structure across the street as well.,5
"My first time here. Waited about 45 minutes before getting seated on a Sunday. As most people said, the place is kinda small so the wait seemed a bit longer. This was one of the palaces I bookmarked so I was excited to try it :) honestly if the wait wasn't so long I'd probably be here more often :)Decided to try the spicy miso ramen. It's a great combo with the spicy tuna. I was surprised at how good the spicy tuna roll was! Also had their cold sake (forgot the name) but it was dry and smooth. I think the bottle label was in blue ... lol hope that helps!",4
"We've been wanting to eat at Daikokuya forever but every time we've gone the wait has always been long. We got our chance Saturday by arriving 15 minutes after they opened, which we still had to wait about 20 minutes. With over 7,000 reviews we though this was going to be the best ramen ever but we were sadly disappointed. Me and my boyfriend both ordered the Daikoku ramen with kotteri flavor and I added the spicy miso taste. The ramen had really no taste, we expected it to be flavorful and it wasn't . My boyfriend didn't even finish his and I added all of the spicy miso to try and give it more taste. The service was good but sadly we won't be coming back. Shin-Sen-Gumi down the street has way better ramen in our opinion",3
"I made my way to Little Tokyo to this ramen parlor for their legendary DAIKOKUYA noodles. A friend who moved from LA to PDX recommended this place. Thanks IronDan, you're truly a ramen snob with refined taste! I understand why you're not totally happy with the ramen options in Portland (yet).Knowing that the waiting line can be crazy long, I got here around 11:30 am on a Thursday and was seated at the bar a minute after checking in.I had the Daikoku Ramen (tonkotsu broth, secret shoyu base, chijire men with desirable firmness, pork belly chashu, boiled egg, bamboo shoots, green onions and sesame seeds) with an additional order of chashu pork. Don't get me wrong, the chashu that comes with the ramen is more than adequate - I just love pork belly. First off, it's visually appealing: a green island with white and ocher fields surrounded by a milky sea. Then came the first slurp: so flavorful and clean tasting. INSANELY DELICIOUS! The chashu was perfectly executed, so tender and soft. It breaks and falls off your chopsticks if you don't handle with care - you can imagine how that would feel in your mouth. All the other ingredients complemented each other very well.I normally don't finish the broth as it usually contains a lot of sodium (at least at other ramen places), but when I was done at DAIKOKUYA, the whole bowl was empty and my ice tea was still full. I didn't even get any ""ramen-after thirst"" throughout the day. GENIUS - how they manage to create such taste without parchedness.",5
"I am a lover of all things noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I first heard about the quest for the ultimate ramen in the movie Ramen Girl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I thought it was a joke, because in the US ramen is what poor college kids survive on. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Cheap and not very good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Then I saw an article about ramen in Japan and realized that ramen might really be something worth eating. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_In the Midwest, ramen houses are scarce. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So when SO and I planned a trip to LA and I saw Little Tokyo on the map, I knew we were in luck. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We choose Daikokuya ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_as the place to experience our first bowl of ramen after some online research and yelp reviews. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When we got in line 30 min before opening and we were the only non Asians, we knew we made a good choice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_At exactly 11 am the door opened and we got our seat! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The place was packed within minutes of ordering. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The menu was full of delectable looking treats, but we wanted ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There were several types to choose from. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The House special, spicy, kotteri, etc. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All kinds of add-ons too. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Being ramen virgins, we went simple. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_House special, kotteri style. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_About 10 min later our bowls arrived. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The aroma was divine. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After the first taste of broth we were hooked. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Salty, fatty, sweet....bean sprouts, onions and noodles. The noodles had soaked up the broth which gave them added flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The meal put our chopsticks skills to the test, but we managed to slurp up the noodles and broth just fine. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is a no frills kind of place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Small dining area. The staff kept the food coming and the line moving. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was a little chaotic, but this place was booming. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The waiting list and line was out the door the whole time we were there. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Servers were helpful, but did not hang around to chit chat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We enjoyed our first taste of ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We will be back next visit to LA.",5
Came here with a party of 8 and loved that they had 2 vegan options for ramen. They offered a spicy sesame broth and a tomato broth. I got the spicy sesame (tomato broth ramen doesnt sound appealing to me lol) and I was not disappointed. They also give very generous portions. My only issue was they separated our party of 8 into two tables of 4 and we were on opposite ends of the restaurant. The least they could've done is seat us all next to each other. But if youre coming as a couple or a small group this is a great place to eat.,4
I've been here for numerous times previously. Finally I can write a review about this japanese ramen place. This was one of the classic original best japanese ramen in the heart of Japanese Town at Los Angeles. Also this was one of my favorite japanese ramen here at Daikokuya. The pork broth is super rich and so good. There will always be a line of ppl waiting outside all the time. But it's definitely worth the wait. Of course inside of this place is kind of small. It could only fits in approximately about maybe 30 ppl at a time. Please note by CASH ONLY.,5
"Ramen is a new concept to me. I don't know what ingredients separates one ramen joint from another joint. Having consumed ramen 6-7 times in the past summer, I honestly don't know what makes everyone go cray cray over Daikokuya, when there are other comparable ramen establishments around LA without the 1-2 hours waiting time. If you lined up the bowls of ramen from all the different LA noodle places in a random blind test, I think only a select handful of people among 100 taste-testers could pick out the Daikokuya ramen correctly. Yes, I'll admit that their charsu is delicious but it's not worth waiting in line for. Their chicken fried rice was also too dry for my own liking, I had to give up on it after a few bites. The broth complemented the noodles and charsu well, but the broth was too salty to drink on its own. Not to mention my waitress had a little mathematical trouble in getting me the correct change back from my bill...lol Consider me unimpressed, Daikokuya!",3
"Very bad customer service, dirty kitchen with flies coming out of it. This place is very cramped with old broken chairs, table and mediocre food. The reason this place has so many review is bc there's always a line to go inside a seemingly good place, but the truth is, it's so cramped that everyone has to wait to get inside a TINY place! I don't think I would recommend this place.",1
"If you are in little Tokyo, this place is a MUST. Little Tokyo in general is very good date area but this place has broth and noodles DOWN. I've never had a ramen place hit all the components of Japanese ramen so wellBroth is not too salty but it is not blandThe pork Chasu is so soft but maintains a bite The noodles (I order hard noodles) texture is really Addicting to slurpbut the BEST in my opinion is THE EGG no other place really has soft boiled sweet eggs in their ramen. The only thing is, the line. The line is so long Pro tip: if you have a long wait ahead of you, put 10 min on the clock and go explore little Tokyo. (My fave place to go visit before is the doughnut shop. I can't remember the name right now but it's next to the Katsu shop)",5
"This little restaurant has massive food portions, and every bite is so tasty. The daikoku ramen and pork cutlet combination was perfect with some Asahi beer to wash it down! I went on a Thursday night at 10 pm, and there was a line out the door. I put my name down and only had to wait about 20 minutes since it was just me. Once I got inside, I felt like I had stepped into a ramen shop in Tokyo. It reminded me of all those hole-in-the-wall ramen places in Japan, and everyone greeted me as I walked in. I sat next to another person seated alone, and he struck up a conversation with me, which was nice. The food came out promptly and freshly cooked, and while the broth could have been more flavorful, I loved the noodles and egg was cooked perfectly. The pork cutlet was perfectly crispy and very filling, I couldn't finish all of it and was sad to leave it behind. Overall, a quality restaurant with friendly staff and customers!",5
"Why is this place famous???? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I just don't get it ya'll. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait was long, and the ramen is okay.",3
"PSA: ***CASH ONLY!!!****Ever wondered what heaven on Earth looked (or tasted) like? Well, if you want to find out, just come to Daikokuya.Expect a wait! This place is very small and incredibly popular. My friends and I as a group of around 4-5 put our name on the guest list on a Saturday night and it took us a little over an hour for us to get seated.For appetizers, we decided on the Takoyaki and the Sliced Roast Pork. I've tried Takoyaki at a couple of places in San Diego and they were always overly doughy. The Takoyaki here was very flavorful and had a way better meat to dough ratio. The Sliced Roast Pork was amazing though and had our group dying for more. Seriously the most tender, flavorful, delicious slab of perfectly fatty meat I have ever experienced at a Japanese restaurant. We loved that so much we ordered another one immediately after without hesitation. For our main meal, we all actually unanimously decided on the Daikoku Ramen, but opted for the Kotteri flavor, which uses added soup extracted from the back fat. Oh my goodness gracious, this ramen came descending from the heavens for sure. Best ramen I have ever had and we all agreed to this. The soup broth was amazing and had a perfect thick consistency, they give you a ton of noodles, the meat and eggs were just cooked perfectly... the whole dish itself was perfection. The bowl is pretty large and will certainly get you full, especially if you were like us and indulged on appetizers! Although very crowded and popular, the service here was great too. Our server and the other workers were very kind, patient, and didn't look stressed out. Their patience and kindness definitely contributed to the overall good experience.Out of all the ramen places I've tried in San Diego as well as Los Angeles, I would have to say that this is my overall favorite ramen I've tried.",5
"Great food!! Great service!! Fun vibe!!The parking can be a challenge and the wait can be a bit much, but this the best (and most authentic) Ramen in L.A. It's definitely worth heading to Little Tokyo and soaking in the awesomeness. It's out of the way for most Angelenos, but it makes for a great night out!",4
"Meh :TI just don't get why people are so crazy about this chain. Like about 10 years ago there were not much tonkotsu ramen places in LA so I got that back in the time. But now? LA just has so many like it's a boom for it. The broth is very light and there are not so much of flavor. I would go there sometime only if there are not much of wait and there are not much of choices but nah, we just have a lot of better option for ramen now.",3
"I hate the line here. There's always a long wait and if you miss your name being called you go back to the bottom of the list. With that being said, the long wait is worth it. This is authentic ramen, best in town!They only have pork broth. I don't know how they cook the egg, it looks like a normal egg but it tastes so delicious. Maybe it's the flavor from the pork broth adding to the taste. Street parking is hard to find but there are some shopping centers around where you can pay to park and walk to Daiko. Cannot wait to go back.",5
"Whenever people ask me what one of my favorite restaurants is in California for ramen, it's a no-brainer: Daikokuya. I fell in love with this place after my first try. Came back a few years later and the food wasn't quite as good as I remembered. I ordered spicy miso again, but the broth was overbearingly sweet. Even all the included ingredients had a touch of sweetness to it, rather than the thick, rich miso taste I remember. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that hopefully, that was just a bad batch.",4
"Ramen here is indeed good, porky fatty soup complements al dante noodles perfectly well and is not seasoned too harshly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A few pieces of pork served alongside is amazing as well, you know, typical melt in your mouth pork goodness. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the reason for 4 star is this. i got a combo with ramen and a katsudon bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_katsudon served along was smaller portion than their full portion but still enough; the problem is its flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_it has your typical dark soy, mirin onion and Katsuobushi flavor, except for it is LOADED with sugar. i do like some sweetness to my katsudon, but they did really overdo it. granted, this was my first visit so it could've been cook's oopsie sugar dump but still, serving that mistake is giving -1 star.another problem is ambiance and environment. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_this place is pretty small and packed with folks but the way they have seating japanese-style is WAY too small even for small guys like me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and lastly, it is hot as !@#$ hell in here. winter time, it may be good to have a bowl of ramen noodles to warm my stomach and all, but summer time, you may die from potential heat stroke. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall, I recommend for ramen!",4
Besides the small and cramped feeling inside and despite the long wait outside the food here is warm tasty and comforting...,4
"The Daikoku ramen is pretty solid, especially with the additional pork fat! It is heavy, but a great bowl. Not the best, but pretty damn good.The Spicy Miso ramen was okay - nothing special. I'd give it a four star if the Spicy Miso were good. I can understand that they're known for one ramen type, but not everybody wants a heavy, porky, fatty ramen. Food is cheap, but cash only. They do have an ATM in the back though. Wish I could give 3.5 stars, since it's cheap, solid, and has vegan options as well.",3
Insane lines but their ramen and pork bowls make it worth it! Try coming at slow times to avoid the huge wait.,5
The combo is the way to go!!!! The katsudon was delish!!! The ramen is huge and good. A little disappointed with the egg which really makes the meal. The soup and noodles were on point!! Service was not too bad. My waitress was sweet and attentive despite it being hectic in there.,4
"Richest. Ramen. Ever.Most nights you'll experience a wait, but there's so much around the area, you can easily walk around to kill time. The noodles are thick, and the broth is extremely rich. Got the chashu, and you add some of their garlic and hot pepper powder, delish! They also have an iced matcha which is very good and refreshing as well. Good balance against the rich ramen.",4
"The daikokuya ramen + fried rice with pork tastes absolutely amazing. The broth is creamy and full of flavor and goes really well with the chashu fried rice. The noodle itself is on the okay side, but the broth makes up for it. And man, I don't know what they do with the salad dressing but it tastes glorious. Beware for price changes, as I've seen it rising slowly. Sooner or later at this rate, I believe the ramen would no longer be worth the money unless something changes. Until then, keep digging into daikokuya, despite the long wait and annoying people smoking around you outside while waiting :)",5
"When I asked my friend where to get some good ramen when I was visiting LA, he recommended Daikokuya. I've been to Little Tokyo a few times, and the first couple of times, the line was so long (over 1 hour) that we settled for other alternatives. However, when I went last summer, we finally decided to wait it out (I think the line was a lot shorter this time).I ordered the Daikoku ramen. And wow, it was impressive. The chashu was so tender and juicy (and also very fatty), and the noodles had a good, firm texture. The broth was very rich and flavorful, maybe just a little more saltier and greasier than I had wished. The portion size was a little small, but well worth the price (about $9 or so).My friends tried the kotteri broth. It looked very rich but also very greasy (from the extra fat).Highly recommended! Just try to go at the non-peak hours.",4
Yo this joint right here 5/5 went here yesterday in and out of the city the wait was def worth it got that wonderful beef bowl and ramen in between with some wonderful beer and great friends excellent experience looking forward to coming back here again,5
This place is worth the hype. Amazing ramen! Gyoza and takoyaki were delicious. Highly recommend adding all three suggested ramen add-ons.,5
Long wait.noodle texture is good.overall just OK ramen.,3
"I USED to love this place and have visited here quite often. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My family was in town visiting from San Diego and called me to come have dinner with them as they were staying at the hotel across the street. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I told them it was a no-brainer, go to Daikokuya.They arrived before me and sat down at a 4 top table, mentioned to the waitress that 1 other person would be joining them. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I arrived 10 mins after they were seated and was refused service. The conversation went like this: Waitress: You can't order, you're lateMe: You were told I was coming, and you were fine with it. You even left a menu for me at the table Waitress: Sorry you can't order, it's our policyMe: I drove 2 hours to get here and have dinner with my familyWaitress: (walks away)Me: Patiently waited and tried to flag another server (nothing happened for 10 mins and received quite a few, HOLD ON hand gestures).After I FINALLY flag someone down. they still refuse. Waitress: You were 25 minutes lateMe: No, I was here, no one would take my order and refused to serve me. Knowing that they were in the bad, they went to the back and spoke for another 10 minutes, come out and told me that I could order from the to-go menu and eat outside. WTFFFFF HELL NO. I ask them where their policy was that someone 10 mins late to the table was denied service and the server mentioned it was clearly posted on the door. When I asked to see the sign, they mentioned it was on the clipboard. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When I checked the clipboard, nothing was listed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is the WORST customer service I've ever had at a restaurant and I refuse to eat at an establishment that would treat their paying customers like that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My family hadn't even received their food yet and they ate in disgust knowing I was treated that way. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Sorry - I'll head to Tsujita where the noodles are WAY better and the attitudes are non-existent. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Owners: take note. Your restaurant may have long lines, but your service sucks, your food's not that great and your beef bowl is 90% rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Patrons: DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!",1
"Going to keep this review short and sweet and say this is one of my favorite ramen places in Los Angeles, even more than Shin-Sen-Gumi or Tatsu. The pork fried rice is AMAZING and I recommend you to try it.",5
It is really good! You have to order the Salad which comes with their special sauce. The sauce is really good!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_definitely would love to come back.The minus point is just the place is too small and crowded. But overall it is a good place to eat ramen!,4
"I am a Daikokuya gal through and through! There are ramen eateries that pop-up with fame, but none have come close to the soulful flavor of Daikokuya's ramen. The perfect texture of noodles to depth of broth... All the ingredients in each bowl of ramen are harmonious while each ingredient plays to its individual strength.The wait is insane, so be prepared to wait. This isn't a place for more than four in a group.Nearest Metro Station: Red and Purple Lines at Civic Center/Grand Park Station",5
"Food: 5/5 ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_3/5My FAVORITE ramen &amp; ramen restaurant!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Yes you will have to wait, but it is SO worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Food is delicious no matter what you get. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The service, however, is decent, don't expect to be treated like a king or queen here, it's a busy place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food way out does the service though. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Space inside is small...but who cares?Food I recommend:-Ramen: DELICIOUS creamy broth &amp; pork based. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The best ""Tonkotsu soup base"" I've ever had, I actually hate most other tonkotsu. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I love the marinated egg they put in the soup (it is colored because of the marinade, don't be scared). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you like the creamy fattiness of the broth, order it kotteri style for more fatty yumminess. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is a spicy option too if you like spicy.-Pork cutlet bowl: Sooo good!!! My fave side dish. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The flavors are so rich &amp; a slight mix of savory &amp; sweet, sweet because of the caramelized onions (you cant even tell they are onions).-Salmon Sashimi: SUPER fresh salmon, delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If it wasn't so pricey I'd get it more often, but hey, it's sashimi.-Teriakyi Chicken: One of the best Teriyaki I've ever had, very fresh, &amp; real flavor from the sauce (not MSG or so gooey as others).P.S. I did not really care for the Monterey Park location, not as tastey as this one. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was disappointed in that one. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_THIS LA LOCATION IS WAY BETTER!",5
"Knowing that LA's Little Tokyo had a famed reputation for good (and japanese) food, this spot was a must try! I found this place through several reviews on LA's best ramen and Japanese food. The line up they had was also very noticeable!Ramen is indeed very good. Noodles are bouncy and the broth is very rich and hearty. I tried the Daikoku vs Kotteri flavour (added soup extracted from back fat, AKA fattier broth) and I HIGHLY recommend asking for Kotteri! There really is a difference between the two broths. Kotteri, the fattier broth, is creamier, richer, and has more depth to it. There's much more flavour packed into it and it's so much more satisfying! The broth here is actually less salty than other places as well (it still is salty but slightly less!) which was a nice surprise. I often find many places having way too much salt that it makes the ramen sickening to eat. Ramen noodles are thick and bouncy which I absolutely love. Toppings on the ramen are also great, very loaded! Egg was also well marinated with an oozing yolk.Takoyaki was fantastic, perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Cold Ramen was quite good too, although it's not for everyone as the broth is different. The broth is a little sour and spicy, and very cold as there are ice cubes in it. Some might not like the flavour or style of it, but the noodles are still good! It's a very refreshing alternative to those who don't want a hearty bowl of ramen. Great place to eat and definitely a place to get your ramen fix. Left full and satisfied and they have quality ramen. Note: You put your own name on the waiting list and wait to be called!",4
The worst restaurant I have ever eaten in. We had four orders none of them was even eatable. If you love yourself don't eat there. Do sth gd foe ur self.,1
"I am a ramen lover, would eat it every day if my body wouldn't hate me for it afterwards.This place is very good, broth is perfect blend of creamy, little fatty, rich and awesome. Noodles are aldente and perfect, could be more springy but different places have different ramen noodles. Line was short when we got here, but I have passed by before where the line wrapped around the block and then some. Very luck find and definitely worth trying the ramen!",5
"I love noodles and I love soup, therefore I love ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We were nearby for a beer bottleshare party so we ventured into Little Tokyo for food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya was highly reviewed on Yelp and close so we walked over, put our names on a list and waited. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya is small and you'd be better off being seated as a party of 2 than a party of 5. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Since it was just the two of us, we were seated after an hour (I know!) at the bar. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ordered some glasses of water and waited for our server to return to take our orders.I knew what I wanted which was the Daikoku ramen (kotteri, for extra fatty flavor) and a side of pork chashu. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My date ordered the same. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A few minutes go by and the server comes back with two steaming bowls of ramen and 2 sides of pork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We could have shared one side but it was worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was so fully of fatty pork goodness and flavor that I stopped talking and proceeded to slurp to my heart's content. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork was tender. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles were perfectly cooked with just the right amount of chew. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My egg was golden and boiled just long enough where the yolk still had a creamy texture to it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was in heaven. My hunger faded as I finished my bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was warm inside the restaurant though, as they have zero A/C. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_CASH ONLY.",4
Just happen to pop on by and walk in. I got the main Ramen dish there and it was amazing. Takoyaki was also really good. Would definitely recommend to anyone.,5
"This is my go to ramen joint. I always get the same thing when I come here. Daikoku Ramen and gyoza. Not a big fan of the long lines and parking, but I will do anything to get my Ramen fix when I want it. Knocked off one star because they only take cash.. all else is great!",4
"Their menu is somewhat small, but what it lacks in variety, it makes up in terms of quality and authenticity. My favorite dishes to get there are the house ramen with a small eel bowl on the side. A second favorite is the chow mein, which sounds pretty ordinary, but is anything but - it is one of the tastiest dishes I've ever tried here. They also serve some sashimi, sushi and teriyaki, but I haven't tried these yet as it's so hard to change dishes since the ramen is so yummy!!Unfortunately, due to the tiny size of this restaurant, expect to find long lines during weekday lunches and weekend dinners. They're open pretty late, but on weekends, there's a line from 6pm onwards. If you plan going during a weekday lunch, try to get there before 11:20 or else you'll also have a long wait.",4
"Came in on a Thursday night at 9pm and had to wait for 30mins for party of 2. Really small inside and cash only, but had to check this place out with over 6,700 yelp reviews. Totally get it cause the ramen was super super good! Great flavor with perfect portion. Will definitely come back again!",5
Top most favorite restaurant in my list literally in like forever! Their food was incredible. I will give it five stars because the food was amazing; despite the fact that customer service was iffy,5
"I been hearing bout this spot for a hot minute. On the real yer boy wasn't scared this mug was gonna be way over hyped. But when that first spoonful hit my mouth I felt like my boy Andrew Wiles seeing Fermat's Last Theorem for the first time, I knew this bowl of next level sh*t was gonna change my life. If you ain't knowing by my name, I loves to grub and I been grubbin on nothin by dope food. I got the gut to prove it, but I never had soup makin me feel some type of way. This spot tho, I don't know that words can describe it, the favors they gettin from that broth, the tenderness of the meat. Woo, finna go wait in line right now to grab me another bowl.",5
Not worth to be on a line to get this ramen. There is more tasty ramen around there. People just feel good cause there is always a long line. This is not a real ramen but ramen for non Japanese ppl.,2
"One of my favorite ramen spots in los angeles, their usually is a wait since it is a small spot but in my opinion its worth it. As for appetizers, takoyaki and gyoza are the best, really flavorful and great for sharing. Their ramen is great, flavorful stock and the chashu pork is cooked well. I always go for the spicy miso ramen but the daikoku is also good",4
"Best ramen of my life. Quality of the food matches the price. Expect to wait. It's often packed here, but at least the turn around rate is fast. Service is nice.",5
"Is it bad that I don't think this place is really that great? I see a bunch of reviews saying ""best ramen ever"" blah blah, and I was there eating it like... I waited an hour and a half for this? This place gets lines up the wazoo? I don't like how they don't let you put down your phone #. You have to wait for your name to be called so just be cognizant of the time if you plan on walking around. I went across the street to some Japanese marts and time flew. Firstly, the line is horrendous here. Like horrendous. I tried coming during my first trip to LA and the line was too long, I settled for Mr. Ramen. Don't do it, it's not that great. This is for Daikokuya but Mr. Ramen was not good - broth no bueno - noodles no bueno - sides no bueno.The wait was whatever and expected fine - you just have to wait in lines for these things. The interior decor was ok - seemed relatively authentic. The bathroom area a bit sus but you might not care about that. I got the kimchi ramen combo w/ donkatsu. The broth was pretty bland compared to what my friends ordered, the original w/ extra fat. It's fine that it was bland but a bit oily as well so that wasn't great. The Katsu dish was ok - seemed like it was out for a bit and kind of microwaved. Which reminds me, I remember the ramen wasn't that hot, it was like room temperature which was a bit odd. I wouldn't want it scorching hot but not like room temperature. I know the soup / broth / base is just made before hand and even the noodles could be cooked but it didn't seem fresh.This could be a one off experience and maybe it really is good as people as it is. I don't see how I could verify that again as the wait for this place is egregiously long. I think overall, you're probably safe coming to this place for ramen but be prepared to wait.",3
Everything was good just thought it would be the best ramen I ever had but I believe I had better. Would try again though if I was in the area. Price is reasonable which is a plus,3
"The only downsides is the wait time and the limited waiting area for guest. I've only visited this restaurant twice but most of the time I usually get their ramen combo deal. The unagi bowl and salmon is super yummy especially their house salad and sauce, bomb.com in my opinion. Their miso ramen is more memorable than the spicy which has an herbal taste at the end which is something I'm different to but overall the service is quick when it comes to the food coming out but the wait time and small area could need some work. But hey I get it, it's one of many many LA spots.",3
The quality of the noodle is not the same as I visited 2 Years ago.The booth of noodle getting a lot wrost,1
Nice little spot for dinner. The lines are usually too long so plan to be a little early. Their spicy miso ramen was super delicious and quite mild. We replaced pork with chicken so it was cool too. Right on the main so parking can be an issue.,4
"Good quality ramen, come early to avoid the long line or be prepared for a 45+ min wait. Some of the best ramen you'll find in the entire area.",4
"Noodles were pretty good. Didn't have to wait on a Thursday afternoon. Had the spicy ramen, not very spicy for me. But i have a high tolerance for hot sauce. So if you can't really stand hot sauce then might be tangy. Overall satisfying meal. Cash only tho.",4
"Don't be scared off by the line/wait! We came on a whim Friday night around 7:30 (party of 2) and were seated within 40 minutes. It looks more daunting because there are actually people waiting for both daikokuya and monzo next door.Once seated, I had the tonkotsu and he had the tsukemon. Both were to die for! Best broth and noodle texture I've had in LA. Different flavor profile from our favorite tsukemon (tsujita). Great portions as well. Highly recommend!",5
"The place was super packed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We had to wait for almost 1 1/2 hours. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_That I understand. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But what I didn't understand was the fact that the person with the list stopped calling people's names and just put a mark next to them, despite the fact that all those people were waiting right there! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Having supposedly ""called"" everyone, she then proceeded to call people, this time for real, from the second list!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When we asked her what was going on, she then lied and said that she had called us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Mind you, we had been right next to her and never heard our name. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Another group of people realized what she was doing and got just as upset. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_She finally went back to the 5 uncalled groups from the first list and started calling out their names. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have no idea how long those people had been waiting. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_As a result, I had to knock off a star for poor service. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen, thankfully, is better than their service. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the spicy miso ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_it's actually on the mild side, but they do give you extra chili oil and sriracha sauce so you can adjust the spiciness as you desire. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth itself is flavorful without being greasy, the noodles are neither too hard or too soft, but are just right. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It probably tasted even better because of how hungry I was.",3
"It's busy, crowded, loud, hot and there will be a wait. But as far as I am concered, it's part of the experience. When you walk through the doors it's like you were transported to Tokyo. I got the Spicy Miso Ramen and it was outstanding, and filling. I would go back in a heart beat.",4
"Maybe I just chose all the wrong places to eat Asian food during my weekend in LA, but I thought 6.7k reviews and a 4 star rating would be some indication of food quality. Unfortunately.. it was mediocre at best. My friend and I had two different ramen, spicy miso and the Daikoku, as well as the salmon and teriyaki eel (unagi) bowls. The broth was fine, the meat was fine, but it wasn't memorable or outstanding by any means. I prefer my ramen to be piping hot, and it was a bit on the lukewarm side for me. The noodles were uncooked and lacked the thick chewiness that I look forward to in Japanese ramen. I don't know.. maybe it was more Nagoya style ramen, but even so, the right texture was not there. In any case, it wasn't my favorite. I strongly prefer the local ramen place in go to in Mountain View up in the Bay. I honestly feel that people are too fixated on this concept of authenticity, both in the food and atmosphere, instead of trying to appreciate the depth of flavors of a dish. Yes, this place has the grungy ""authentic"" vibe because of all the old school Japanese advertisements and cheap handmade signs. And that's cute and homey, but it has nothing to do with the food quality. I feel like nice looking restaurants get a bad rep because somehow it's not enough of an underdog or they give off the impression that the restaurant cares more about the interior design than the food. But that's really not the case. You can have a decently well designed modern restaurant without any relics from the past, and still have incredible food. I didn't think this was the conclusion I would make after eating food from LA, but LA really needs to step up its game. The only thing I would recommend is the teriyaki eel (unagi) bowl.",3
"Such. Delicious. Ramen. I came here just as it opened on a Tuesday, and there was already a line of around 10 people at the door! However, we were all seated quickly and the staff are very quick and efficient without rushing you. I had their regular pork ramen (the Daikoku Ramen) and it was amazing. I've never tasted broth so rich! They give you a huge bowl and it is so savory and filling and delicious. I'm not sure I'd be up for a long wait -- but if you are able to snag a table during a less-busy time, it is so worth it.",5
"The line for this place is crazy! My friends and I came here about 30 minutes after it initially opened on a Sunday and we were quoted an hour wait at least with 30 tables ahead of us. I was expecting a longer wait but fortunately it was only about an hour and 15 minutes. Quite a few tables that were ahead of us were called but the people were not there so they had to skip over the missing parties. Too bad for them but great for us! I really advise checking periodically because you never know how quickly the list can go. Overall, I found this place to be okay. The pricing and portions of the food was great. I got the Daikoken Ramen combination with a small pork cutlet bowl ($13.95). There were two main things that made just like it but not love it. The first was my choice of the small pork cutlet bowl. I was not a fan of the pork cutlet. It was mushy on the outside and was too sweet to my liking. Usually I try not to have my dislike for sweetness in savory foods impact my review but I just didn't think the sweetness worked with the dish at all. My second slight issue with it was the noodles. It wasn't as al dente as I would like it. The noodles were alittle thicker than other ramen places I have had which I liked but it was a bit too soft to the bite. I would prefer it to be more al dente.Everything else however was great. The small salad dressing was delicious and plentiful. Their ramen broth was superb with the kurobuta pork belly chasu, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and green onion. The marinated boiled egg was cooked to perfection. The yolk was almost raw on the inside. Delicious to mix in with the broth. Given the price and what they offer, it definitely is worth a try regardless. The wait service was attentive and nice. I would just try to get there as early as possible to avoid a long wait.",3
This is by far my favorite place to get noodles. great vibes and fast service the spicy miso ramen needed absolutely nothing I usually have to add a bit more of something but this one was amazing,5
"Stay clear of this place unless you want uninvited insects on your table.... This place has forever ruined ramen for me. I found this place on yelp. 7,000 reviews and four stars, plus they have vegan ramen, it was a good find. We went during the week so there was no wait.. I walked to the back to wash my hands and was unimpressed with the cleanliness. I had a feeling I should go, as restaurants should be tidy. But I thought, ""its a hole in the wall type of place, it has an A grade it should be fine"". Food was fine until we were paying, when we looked down there was a ROACH ON THE TABLE!!! I was in utter disgust but we had a child with us and I didn't want to make a scene. We left out to go food there and left to go buy something for the nausea I had after seeing that. I uploaded a video because it was so gross people should be aware. It's not fair that's it has an A rating, I'm just glad we didn't have food poisoning.i",1
Great Ramen! Original is delicious but what really makes me drool is that spicy Ramen!,5
"WOW! First I went on a Sunday night. I paid for parking across the street. I could see the huge line from across the street. So you have to walk in a write your name down on the waiting list. Yup there was like 25 parties in front of us. We waited like 45 minutes. We ordered two soups #1, two appetizer, two fried rice and chicken teriyaki bowl for my son. So I can tell you this place is worth the wait! They service is the best I've ever had. As soon as we got there we got water 3 minutes later our order was taken and we got our appetizers with 5 minutes. I love vegetarian dish omg the cucumber rolls freakin amazing. The potstickers I think that's what they were well I could only have one because my boyfriend and son wouldn't share that good. The soup was pretty good. You have to come here there is only 2 waiters and one waitress and two Mexican cooks. To see how cool calm and collective they are left me in amazement. I would come for the service alone and the food is licking finger good",5
"Sorry guys, I got food poisoning here. Stomach bubbles and needing a toilet really bad in Downtown Los Angeles is no fun. Fortunately, I knew there would be a restroom in Union Station. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After expelling my lunch, I made it home and vomited most the night. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The only other thing I had to eat that day was a granola bar in the morning. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have no food allergies.I've been to Japan twice, so I can say the service is ""authentic"" and the food is otherwise fantastic.I've eaten here several times before.",1
Had no idea this place was as famous as it is- ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_we just passed it on the street and looked cute. We were lucky enough to only have to wait about half an hour because this was Sunday morning at 11. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Needles to say it was delicious - probably the best ramen I've ever had.,4
"Excellent food, excellent service and an excellent price. Well run restaurant, food came out fast and never had to ask for a refill they were on top of it!",5
This place was super small and luckily my friends and I didn't have to wait to be seated (went around 1:45pm)! I got their daikokuya ramen &amp; OMG!!!! So much flavor and the noodles were perfect!,5
"This is an institution. It has a long line out the door in a Little Tokyo full of ramen places for a reason. The ramen is delicious and comes out fast, and the choice of pork back fat broth is a must. It is so darn flavorful, just make sure you have room for all of the noodles and broth, and a ton of water to wash it down. It's not a daily eat, but it should seriously be near the top of the list of best restaurants in Downtown LA. Come early to avoid the wait (around opening), and skip breakfast beforehand. Load up on ramen instead.",5
The place is the bomb. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The best miso broth I've ever tasted. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ We also had some sashimi which was good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They have beer and wine as well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Parking sucks but hey it's DTLA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Also the line is long soehabe a drink across the street to kill a bit of time.,5
My favorite Ramen place of all time. I was born in Japan and I have tried many Ramen places all over and this hands-down his number one. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The seating is not very large and they are a very popular restaurant so expect a wait.,5
"The infamous Daikokuya with its lines of people waiting to try the pork broth of heaven. Best way to avoid the crowd and line is to show up 20 mins before it opens on Sunday (free street parking all day) and be one of the first to go in. The place is tiny and cramped inside. They are known for their ramen so the appetizers are really just there but nothing special about them. I'm not a crazy fan of this type of ramen and the hype for this place was too much for me to feel impressed. It's good, not sure if I would make a long drive or ever wait in line for it though.",3
"Order key: Ramen, Fried rice, Teriyaki chickenOne of the best ramen place in Los Angeles. This is second to Tatsu ramen. I know this place has more review than most restaurants have. It's good in here but I just like the home made noodles what tatsu ramen have. The place is great! I know it's small I like it that way. I'm used to it because I came from cebu, Philippines ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_where most food place has small place. other term for this it is, karenderyaosh! Thank you for the good ""ramen""! good ""fried rice"" and ""teriyaki chicken""",5
"This place has a wait time, quick dine in, and get up and go so the next person can sit type of vibe. I ordered a bunch of apps and my boyfriend ordered ramen. The cali roll was filled with imitation crab and barely avocado/cucumber, the tempura was good but I didn't like how it was mostly filled with tomato, the takoyaki was great, the fried rice and gyoza was okay, and he said the ramen was good, but very simple. And their salad dressing that they sell in bottles was so good, they dress it with a frisÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©e type salad. Service is definitely quick and Asian, which means drops stuff off without saying much. I would come back but wouldn't go out of my way for it again.",3
"Came here on a weekday around 11:20 am to beat the lunch crowd as there was no wait. Got the Daiko ramen and it was good, the broth was nice and the noodles were perfect. Close to the Double Tree Hilton and the courthouses.",4
"This is not ""life changing"" Ramen. It's differently not worth waiting an hour or more for a table. The price is good, the Ramen is average. The service is not the best. If I only had to wait 20 min for a table at this place and their broth was as good ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_as Slurpin Ramen in K-town this would be a 5 star restaurant. They have the benefit of being one of the first ramen restaurants in DTLA so people will wait for average ramen.",4
"If you're going to eat here, expect a long wait (we waited for about 1 hour 30 min). They don't really call your number (it's on the same line you would write your name and group party number on the paper) in order but it depends on which tables/how many spots are open. If you want to check if they've called your name yet, you'd check the list which they place inside right in front of the door. There's no point in asking them because the workers are too busy and even if you did, they'd be clueless too.When they finally called my group's number, they also called another group's. ""Number 32 and number 36!"" My group is number 32 and we have a party of 4-same as the other group 36. Upon entering, they seated 36 first and they told my group to wait on the side. Not going to lie, we were kind of upset that the waiter didn't realize it before that there was only one open table and that she made us wait even though 32 comes before 36. What's done is already done, we looked at how busy the place was, and assumed she's probably having a bad day already. Plus it's always good to look at the bigger picture - to be thankful and to practice kindness, patience, and forgiveness so we waited the extra 10 min, not a big deal. The second female waiter was fast in taking our orders. It was hard to understand her since she has a thick Japanese accent but she understand us and that's all that matters. I believe there are two types of ramen - Daikokuya and Spicy Miso. Not sure if it's correct but the waiter but saying spicy miso is the same as Daikokuya only it is spicy version...Finally our ramen arrived very shortly after we ordered, waited prob only 10 min. After bringing out our ramen, the male waiter removed the pile of paper chopstick wrappers and straw wrappers we left in a pile. So attentive of him.Didn't think anything else could go wrong that night but... after I asked for our check, another problem came up (BTW this place does cash only! I noticed an ATM machine in the back near the restrooms). The male waiter took our check to the register - total of $52 so I placed $60. 5 min later I see the female waiter bring it to our table and bring to our attention that we are short. Of course I told her I placed enough cash, so she took it back and asked her coworker. They looked around and saw that the money had flown away and was on the ground... well that was an eventful night.",3
Came in around 11:30 just before closing. I could feel the vibe like they just wanted us out even thought there open till 12:00. I ordered a spicy miso ramen and porl cutlet bowl. The ramen was way too salty and the egg and pork was cold in the ramen. Then I tried to eat the noodles and they were still kind of hard. A very big LET DOWN. This place is not good Japanese ramen.,1
"I'm so happy we found this place on our late night dinner quest!!!After attending a concert that ended pretty late we were starving and were on the hunt for a restaurant that was still opened. Lucky for us this place was opened until 1:00am. We found parking right up front and we were very grateful for that since parking in LA is terrible.There was a wait list of course since it was packed, but we only waited around 20 minutes which wasn't too terrible considering nothing else around there was open. To start we got and order of gyoza. It came really hot and they fried it up pretty good cause it almost looked burned. It was suppose to be five pieces but it was kind of a giant blob since they were molded together forming one giant gyoza. The gyoza was ok, I was too hungry and in a hurry to eat so I kind of burned my tongue with the pipping hot gyoza. We ordered their famous Daikokuya ramen and my BF ordered the same with their extra fattier broth. The bowls of ramen where so huge!! The broth was good but I think it needed some more flavor, I'm use to ordering spicy miso with my broth and they didn't have that option so I was kind of disappointed. But the noodles were nice and chewy and the ramen came fully loaded with an hard boiled egg, bamboo shots usually these are extra toppings you have to pay for. What I was really excited about was their $2 mug of beer!!! What a steal!!! The place is on the smaller side and its really not great for big groups the limit would be four in a booth unless someone doesn't mind sticking out on the narrow walkway and be in the way of the waiters.",3
"I had huge hopes for this place as some of my friends came here multiple times raving about the ramen here when they visited LA. My boyfriend and I were quite disappointed with the broth and the cha siew - we had the heavy broth, which was simply fatty and didn't have a wow factor like some of the spots in NY (like Minca and Totto). Normally I'd drink the soup to the bottom of the bowl; however I left with the entire soup as was. The cha siew was plain average as it isn't the type to melt in your mouth and wasn't well seasoned. We also tried the seasonal cold ramen; as it was one of our first times having this, we weren't huge fans of cold broth that had ice in it so it's hard for us to fairly criticize.We waited approximately 30 mins. on a weekday during lunch so it wasn't too terrible. However, this would probably not be something I'd come back to again if I revisit LA and would not wait for.",3
"The reviews and the amount of reviews says it all. This places is like heaven.Probably the best ramen I have had in LA. Maybe the only down side would be the amount of time that we would have to wait on line to get sat since the place is pretty small. I have found that Santa Monica has another branch too, but there is something about this place that it tastes better. I always get the combination ramen with the spicy miso broth. It could be a bit spicier. But overall the broth is a killer. its rich in flavor and not too bold. Even though I have moved up North I still visit this place whenever I am in town. Even though sometimes it takes a while to get sat, it is worth the wait. While waiting, just stroll down the street, and visit some of the cool shops that Little Tokyo has to offer. There are definitely many cool shops to visit. After you are done eating maybe you can head to Pinkberry as it is right down the street.",5
"I can't believe I waited an hour for ramen... All I can say is, it was well worth it! We order gyoza, spicy miso ramen and the pork belly rice bowl. The gyoza was real different from anything i've had in the past, extra crispy and fried to perfection. The miso ramen was flavorful and lived up to my expectations of a perfect bowl of ramen. The pork belly rice bowl was also extremely delicious, i'm more of a rice guy so I'd definitely order a large bowl of pork belly rice the next time I return here. This will be a must go place everytime I travel to LA from now on.",5
Delicious spicy Miso ramen! Recommend adding the side pork cutlet if you're feeling hungry &amp; a Sapporo of course!,5
"The pork slices are at the most 1/4 "" thin so they actually integrate into the noodles and essentially become invisible. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is fine, but I wouldn't go back. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Why is it cash only? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My main concern is how grimy the cloth ""curtains"" are at the front door, they don't garner confidence in how the rest of the establishment is in cleanliness. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Restaurants just next to it and down the street are so much cleaner from the ceiling to the floors. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Been eating ramen for over 50 years, from when a bowl was 25 cents, and it's not my imagination that it was so much more ethereal in many umami ways back then.",2
Overrated. I was disappointed with the ramen. My husband thought it was too salty. The only plus was the egg that it came with.,3
"AMAZING RAMEN. So authentic. Get the back fat broth and extra pork. The wait might be a little long but that's because this place is so good. When my boyfriend and I went, we waited for about 30 minutes at 10pm but it's all so worth it. If you're with a big group, your wait might be a lot longer. The waiters were very nice and cater to all your needs. Coming from NY, this place tops any of the ramen places I've been to.",5
"Pretty good ramen, I always get the classic Daikoku ramen and that's what they are known for. Broth was flavorful, consistency of the noodles was right, eggs and chasiu were decent. Definitely recommend it. Be prepared for the long wait, 4 of us went there on a Saturday and it was over an hour! Well the 6k 4-star reviews explained it.CASH ONLY!",4
"The ramen was good. Noodles were nice and firm, which is good. I would for sure come back. The only downside to this place is that it's always packed and you sometimes have to wait.",4
"If you're looking for your Ramen fix! This is the perfect place for you! Get Daikoku Ramen then add koteri flavor! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you are looking at getting their combinations I highly recommend Daikoku Ramen + small pork cutlet bowl. Also, do not leave this restaurant without trying their Takoyaki!!",5
Heaven on earth period! Don't go anywhere else except here for ramen. Everything on there menu is exceptional.,5
"The rice is a little bland and I expected more chasu in it. They really skimp you out on that. The ramen, we've had better ramen. I don't think it's worth the 45 minute wait time. I'd rather go to a better ramen shop than a hyped up place.",3
Definitely the go to spot when you're in Little Tokyo. I ordered the spicy ramen and it was the best I've ever had.,5
"So good! Worth the wait. You can put your name in, then ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_walk across the street for a beer. The salad dressing is amazing. So glad they sell in a bottle to go for only $6.",4
"Expect a really long wait during peak hours. We waited about an hour and were starving. We ordered gyoza, regular ramen and the spicy miso.Ramen was very good, service was quick and nice, but wouldnt wait in line for it again. Maybe if we came at a less busy time. Prices were reasonable.",4
"I'm not really a fan of ramen but if I have to eat it then I prefer it to be authentic which means Japanese owned. And there are not too many Japanese owned ramen places nowadays! Their broth is pretty good, noodles cooked al dente and their chasu is perfectly fatty and tender. I love their rice bowls especially the fried rice and the shredded pork bowl. The fried rice is cooked in some sort of lard - fatty but delicious. The shredded pork bowl has a nice char on the outside, marinated well (some sort of teriyaki marinade) and topped off with ginger and onions. Order a combo (ramen + rice bowl) so you can try the best of both worlds.",4
"The first place I went to on my vacation in Los Angeles and it definitely did not disappoint! The place was super packed when I arrived and there was limited seating for waiting guests. The place was extremely small and it felt like the AC wasn't working well. Definitely did not help that I was eating hot soup but it was worth it! We got a seat at the bar and received our food pretty quickly after ordering. I ordered the daikoku ramen. The egg was cooked to perfection and the pork was delicious and moist. I also loved the broth! The noodles were a little too firm for me but my friend said you can ask them to cook them a bit longer if you prefer more cooked noodles like me. The amount you get for the price is definitely worth it! I had quite a bit of noodles leftover. Next time I'm in LA, I'll definitely be visiting again!",4
Yummy ramen. I ordered the spicy miso and it was delicious. Portions are large so I was definitely full after eating it. Parking sucks! There's street parking around the area with a 2 hour limit up until 8pm ($4 for the 2 hour). This is ok if there isn't any wait. I arrived at 5:15pm in a Wednesday night and waiting about 15 minutes. Your entire party must be present to be seated. Not recommended for parties larger than 4. There are small booths along with a bar like seating area. Service was great. Difficult to understand our waitress at times but she was still super nice. Even checked in on us from time to time to refill our drinks. Will definitely be back.,5
"IS THE 1-2 HOUR WAIT WORTH? yes, it freakin' is. What I usually do is put my name down, look how far down I am on the list. if you're more than 8 names down for a party of 3+, that's approx. 1 hour wait.. or more. But if you're just here by yourself, it's less than 20 minutes usually. Then if you're with just you and your boo, usually 30-45 minutes unless there's like 10+ parties of 2 ahead of you. But if that's the case, just walk around little Tokyo for a bit. There's a lot to see and stuff to explore. People say Shin-sen-gumi is better, or daikokuya better but honestly you can't compare the two. The vibes of the two locations are different and even the broth tastes different. I always get the ramen + small rice bowl combo and share it with my boyfriend cause I can't finish a bowl of ramen by myself but sharing half a bowl of ramen isn't enough.. lol. I also get the takoyaki because it's my favorite~ Relatively cheap for the amount of food you get. I don't think i'd ever get tired of this.",5
Ramen came out fast and was very hearty. Very good. The egg was so soft our chopsticks were able to cut through no problem.,5
Decided to spend the day in LA and hangout and we can across this cool spot. The food is absolutely amazing and the customer service is beyond exceptional. I tried the Daikokuya because it's there number 1 seller and it was very good. I recommend anyone stop by here when there in the area.,5
Fantastic food and very fast service. There are also plenty of vegetarian options. I had the spicy miso and my sister had the spicy sesame seed and both were excellent. It was well worth the wait!,5
"No. Just no.This place is overrated. So overrated!Long waits are fine if the place is worth it.It's not worth it. There are so many great places around it, why not try those instead? Details of visitThe wait was over 40 minutes after signing in. On a Monday. At 3:30pm. What is it like during an actual meal time?! Unimaginable.The booth seats were torn up and taped. Table is greasy, walls are yellowed, greasy indoor stale bad air. The lanterns were shredding.Good service with a very strange waiter.$11 ramen: (price is fine but...)The only thing stand out from average tasting was the egg, which is half cooked and half raw with soy saucey taste.Combo add on:The egg and chicken rice was very raw eggy, I like raw eggy but this was like I could still see clear egg white. The rice was completely slimy with raw egg. They should have just had the egg on top and let some soak through so you at least could mix it with some unsoaked rice. Drinks:Nothing to call home for. Would I return to this place? No.Am I ashamed I assumed by looking at the lines outside that this has to be good? Yes.Most surprising fact? Health department rated this establishment an A. Wow. Just wow.",1
4:50 PM Sunday April 26th 2015PROS:- Daikoku Kotteri Ramen - delicious!! must get!! Broth is amazing. I love the soft boiled egg! Noodles are slightly on the hard side.- Gyoza is pretty good - I like that it has cabbage in it.- Small Shredded Pork Bowl was delicious and flavorful. Just a bit on the salty side though. THE OKAY:- Spicy Miso Ramen - too spicy for me.CONS:- wait time. Bar area is a little cramped and it's kind of hard to share food with your friends. - Place is small and cramped.NOTE: CASH ONLY,4
"If you're in Little Tokyo and craving some miso ramen, this is a good option. Pros: speedy service, tasty miso broth, perfectly al dente noodles, buttery pieces of chashu pork that literally melt in your mouth, not overdressed, dumplings made with love and topped with tons of green onion, great price for the serving sizeCons: small dining area, so there can be a wait (but it is sooooo worth it imo), not ideal for parties larger than 4 people (6 is doable, but expect a longer wait and a cozy seating arrangement)",5
"Good vibe,tasteful,my first time here won't b the last time!!!!try the tuna poke bowl i recommend it",5
"All I can say is wow, just wow. This place heaven for a vegetarian Japanese American; never before have I had such delicious bowl of ramen! The dish I tried was their spicy sesame vegan, and again just wow. The broth was amazingly crafted, with hints of sesame breaking through the spice. My girlfriend recommended this place from the last time she was in LA and the pilgrimage was worth it! There is a wait, but I can easily see why. If you come to LA and love Ramen, go here. Period.",5
"Wow! I'm so glad I came here after seeing this place on Yelp. I waited around 30-40 minutes and got seated for 4.We ordered the kokuya ramen? The special house ramen with the fat in it. The broth was SO flavorful and the noodles cooked to perfection. It was very hot inside which I didn't like but whatever.The ramen here is very very similar to Orenchi in Santa Clara, almost identical. This place definitely loses in the egg department though because Orenchi had a perfect soft boiled egg and here it was a tad over cooked.But Daikokuya has chili oil which added a nice spice to the ramen.Overall, they're pretty much counterparts and have very slight differences. Delicious!!",4
"Very traditional scenary. Wait was about 15 minutes for two on a Wednesday afternoon. Odd time but we still had a little wait. Fast service though, got our meals within 10 minutes after our order and our appetizer cane out before that. Ordered the combo daikokuya speciality with ikura (salmon roe ) bowl, in addition to the gyoza and pork appetizer and my bf got the salmon sashimi bowl. Total was $50 including two green ice tea. Very satisfying and it lives up to the hype",5
overrated but infact this is a Terrible place!! Disrespectful server! I will not recommend this place to anyone!! The server run over us and stop us; and make a scene as if we didn't pay for our food.. she's forcing us to give her 20% tip!! Not reasonable for their service.. didnt refill our drinks. Food was bland. And waiting line is 1hr plus the food comes late.. We'll never come back to this place ever..,1
"Good ramen, I can agree that this is the best in town. However, because of its popularity, the wait times are very long and usually there are many lined up outside the door. The service was alright in the beginning. After we ordered and the servers brought us our bowls, that all changed. I don't mind waiters bringing the check early (which I closed in a couple minutes) but they kept on returning every minute to ask ""Oh, are you done with that?"" ""I'm going to take this now"" ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_""Did you pay yet?"" ""Do you need the check?"" (wtf i already paid and tipped)No, my friend and I aren't slow eaters, so why would you rush people like that? In any case, not returning anytime soon. It was not a fun experience being herded out the door as soon as I started eating.",3
"I came here around 11:30am with a group of 4. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I took us about a half an hour wait to get seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The place is pretty small and there's a lot of people already waiting to get seated.I got the Daikokuya ramen with the kotteri flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was pretty good. I would've though the broth would be more flavorful though. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The chashu was also delicious, but I also thought it would be more flavorful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got the combo for the ramen and decided to get the pork cutlet bowl; it also comes with a salad. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The salad was okay. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The bowl was quite tasty though, but it looked somewhat unappealing when I first saw it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had this... ""oh, it's like this"" thought that came across my mind. I think I might have had slightly higher expectations for this place. Overall, the amount of food is plentiful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service was nice and friendly.",3
"Finally got a vegan option so I had to taste. Either business is not as booming or my homies and I showed up on the perfect night. Almost 0 wait. Service is great, vegan option is rich and noodles were great. Only thing is the toppings are minimal in comparison to other joints (silverlake ramen, kai ramen, tatsu). I'll admit that I wasn't super hungry so that could have an effect on my opinion of the ramen. Gonna go once again on an empty stomach to give a balanced review. Regardless, this place loves to the hype",4
"Prepare to wait at least 1.5 hours for a table if you don't get here early! This place gets busy very quickly because it's right in the middle of Little Tokyo. The restaurant isn't too big, so I don't believe you should come here if your party is more than 4 people. They have booths along the wall and a few tables off to the side, as well as bar seating. So you can imagine large parties wouldn't fit comfortably here.I've been here three times and I've always ordered the Daikoku ramen. It comes with a soft-boiled egg, delicious and tender pork belly, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, green onions and sesame seeds. For a richer flavor, ask for kotteri to be added. This is added soup extracted from the back fat of the pork, so it's definitely richer and you guessed it, more delicious.The ramen comes to a total of about $10 or so per bowl. More $ if you add more toppings. Not too bad for a delicious and hefty bowl of ramen! If you feel like trying other items, they do have ramen and rice bowl combinations, which are good for sharing. Or if you're really hungry from all the waiting, I'm sure you can probably finish it all. Their gyoza appetizer and takoyaki was also quite delicious, so give those a try if you can.The last thing that I really enjoy about this place is that they make their own salad dressing. It's delicious and you can even purchase a bottle to bring home. However, the shelf life is about 1 week for optimal flavor. Really wish that this was located somewhere in the Bay Area. It's a pain to have to find parking in Little Tokyo and have to sit through LA Traffic just to get here...",4
"3.5 When it comes to hakata ramen, Daikokuya beats out all the mediocre but when comparing above that level Daikokuya gives off a sense of complacency.. Frozen gyoza?! Stop it! It's cooked perfectly but if it was fresh then it would be to die for. Aside from that, for a place that has hordes of people waiting outside I would hope that the ramen here would reek of amazingness but.. it wasn't for me. The noodles were slightly overcooked, but thankfully they don't share the same problem of drowning out the broth flavor as it does in their Monterey Park branch. The hakata broth flavor wasn't as developed; I felt that the flavors, while strong and true to taste, were shallow in depth. Overall, it was a good, balanced bowl of ramen that was good, but not great.",3
"This is the best ramen I have ever had, hands down. There is something about the soy and miso broth that cannot be duplicated. Be sure to arrive at least 20 minutes before opening if you want first seating. There are only six booths and a bar that sits about 15 people. Cash only, but very resonably priced. The fried rice is also amazing. Definitely the best in Little Tokyo. Evident since no other place has a line out the door!",5
"The best bowl of ramen I've had outside of Japan. It was raining HARD in LA that day and my wait was around 30 minutes. Seeing that this place has a lot of questionable positive ratings and the constant mention of its unjustified long lines, I was expecting to be disappointed to yet again patronize another overhyped Yelp ramen joint (no to the trash in San Mateo), but was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong! The interior is divey and worn-out, but coming from San Francisco, I was used to that sort of environment that hipsters long for. Ordered the $11 Daikoku ramen. Thick, flavorful soup with ramen noodles cooked perfectly. They gave me the entire egg (in SF they only give you half!), which was cooked perfectly. Pork was just fine. I love a lot of scallions in my food and this bowl had the perfect amount! Expect very casual, quick service--this isn't a fancy joint to relax. In the true nature of ramen culture, you order, eat, and go! Now, is this place worth a two-hour wait? Probably not. But I was lucky to have only waited 30 minutes I suppose. Will come again on another rainy day!",4
"Enjoyed the spicy ramen. However, I need to remember to ask for it to be spicier. The add'l powder chili on the counter did not satisfy my spicy craving. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had a pleasant first experience. Seating was fast considering the long waiting list and service was great as well. Looking forward to returning for all the other delicious looking items on their menu like their poke and sushi.",4
"Well worth the wait in my opinion. Don't forget to put your name on the sign-in sheet upon arrival! We ordered a Spicy Miso, a Daikoku (w/ kotteri flavor), and the Tsukemono (pickled veggies). The tsukemono was pretty great, interesting vegetables and the sesame seeds sprinkled on top were a nice touch. The Spicy Miso was likely the best spicy broth I've ever had. Great body and not overly spicy. The pork in mine had a strong pork aftertaste which was a little jarring, but I'll chalk it up to that particular slice as the pork in the Daikoku was just fine. The Daikoku broth with kotteri flavor was out of this world. So much complexity in the broth. Noodles in both were great and the soft-boiled eggs were wonderfully gooey. I'd be interested to try other ramen places in Little Tokyo for comparison, but the broth here is what really stood out to me.",5
"Pretty disappointed with the food here. The Tonkatsu was overfried, so the coating/breading was tough. The meat was dry. The Gyoza was not properly made so it looked like ravioli. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The outside of the Gyoza was not crispy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen is lukewarm and not that tasty. However, the service was friendly. This place seemed very popular, but eveything we tried felt half-assed done, not terrible, but not fantastic either. Not worth the wait in line.",3
"This is my all time favorite ramen place! I don't come here as often as I would like because of the long wait. There is always a wait, except maybe when I was here on a weekday around 3pm, there was not a wait.I always order the daikoku ramen and takoyaki. Sometimes I would order it with extra noodles and chasu for an additional $2.50 each. The wait ranges from 20 minutes to an hour plus.",5
plum wine and tempura is good. Shredded pork bowl is Ok. takoyaki is just soso. But the most popular dish -ramen is a real disappoint. The soup is fineÃ¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_not too salty nor the thick. But the texture of the ramen itself is sososososo. Pork cutlet bowl is even worse than soso.I don't think that it worth my waiting for such a long time in the queue.,2
"Worth the wait. If you walk into a Ramen place that doesn't have one don't even bother going in. Oh, if there isn't a Japanese patron inside, just walk straight out too. I'm just doing you a favor. My food suggestions are irrelevant because everything is pretty delish. Kompai.",5
"RAMEN FOR THE RICH AND POORI've come to the conclusion that Ramen is like making love. Different strokes for different folks. Everyone is going to argue which Ramen is the best. And in all honesty, It really depends on your mood, like music. I encourage you to try them all. It's called Ra-Men ( plural )for a reason and not Ra-Man... All jokes aside...I'm surprised at myself for not reviewing Daikokuya before. I've been coming to Daikokuya for at least 10 years. Long before they opened their Monterey Park and Sawtelle location... Long before Shin Sen Gumi opened around the corner. Before, the wait times were ridiculous. You could drive to Monterey Park and eat before you would get seated. *to be honest, this could still be applicable, the parking over there would be way easier too.* Fortunately for you, the wait times are considerably shorter these days. Now you don't have to resort to eating Mr. Ramen next door. *shakes my head*One of my favorite moments at Daikokuya was spotting the actress Sandra Oh eating here. It made me feel special because even celebrities eat this stuff. They're humans just like us!The default choice is the Spicy Miso Ramen! But I'll eat anything on the menu.My favorite thing to do here when I was younger was to get the Ramen and Fried Rice combo!Then save the fried rice for lunch the next day... Boy did it feel good waking up knowing you sorta saved money on lunch. What a value I tell you.To do this, especially in Little Tokyo, you must be alert and have homeless person awareness. They know you got the good stuff in those to go bags. One time a homeless man pretended to be a zombie or some scary $h*T. I was like ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_""Aaah!!! just take it!"" ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_At first, I felt like man, he must have been hungry, poor guy... I'm such a great person to voluntarily give him my fried rice... But on second thought I was like NO! That MF jacked my fried rice to go!!! I was so pissed! You know how sad I was the next day. ( T^T ) I had a plan for happiness and the homeless psycho ruined it. Till this day I wish I reverse cyclone kicked him in the face into a hyper combo finish!",5
"CASH ONLY! but there is an atm in the back. The food was great! Thankfully we went for later lunch on a weekday, so we didn't have to wait in the infamous line; but I can understand why people would wait. The place is small but has really good food. One of my friends can't eat pork, so we were very happy for the option for a vegan ramen. She said it tasted pretty good. My husband said he was surprised at the flavor in the her ramen; but being a meatatarian, of course the regular ramen was better. We love ramen and this place makes it on our top five list.",5
"Bomb Ramen and Bomb Takoyaki! It gets busy and its a small place so be ready to wait, but it is so worth the wait. I personally only like the spicy miso ramen. It is the only one that doesn't have the meaty taste to its broth. Also the ramen combo is a good deal, it comes with a side dish of your choice so you get to try more stuff on the menu.",4
This has got to be my favorite ramen place in Little Tokyo. Got there around 6ish on Saturday and the wait was maybe 30mins for 2 people. We got a bar seat and the servers were quick in taking our orders. My friend and I both for the combination of a small bowl and their special ramen. The noodles were chewy and the broth flavorful. I got the small beef bowl and it was exactly how the menu described it haha. I don't remember the exact wording but yes it was one of those beef bowls we know and love. My friend got the pork cutlet bowl and she liked it! I thought the egg made it a little soggier than I usually enjoy my cutlets but the flavor was on point! Overall great experience as usual!,5
"This place is out of control.The daikokuya ramen is heavenly. I would've cried tears of joy, but it would have ruined this delightful bowl of ramen.The broth is the best I've had in recent memory. The noodles are chewy. The egg is perfectly cooked (almost solid yolk). The meat is tender.Only downside is that there is always a wait, but there is a ton of pokestops nearby!15th on the list, waited for 20-30 minutes (party of 2).Service is good.CASH ONLY.",5
Queue isn't that long if you're in a party of 3 and below. Go straight for the ramen and take home that bottle of daikokuya home made sauce ! Worth every dollar.,3
"The ramens here are pretty good. This isn't the best ramen place I've been to (3rd on my list), though it's close to my top ones. The the meat is great, but I feel like the broth is just a tad bit bland. I might be nitpicking here, but compared to my top two places, it's just a little bland. I also dislike how they use the thin yellow noodles. I prefer the thicker one. The portions are a little on the small side, so I wasn't quite full (then again I could just be a fatass who eats a lot). Despite my criticism of the place, it's an overall good ramen place that serves quality food. While it's not my top choice, many of my friends said this is the best ramen place they've ever been to. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place is usually very packed so you're going to have to wait in line most of the time. Their waiting area is tiny; it only has enough seats like 4 people I believe. The place also does not have AC. They only have fans. So during a hot day, you will still be sweating a little (though that could be just me because I have low tolerance for heat, but my friends did agree that it's hot).",4
"By far the BEST ramen I have ever had. I will drive over an hour to come here, just for one bowl of the miso ramen. I've stood outside in the rain for 45 minutes to get a table, it was 100% worth it. Also remember its $$$ CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM in the back.",5
Great ramen. Had to wait in line. Yummy. But limited in choices. Drink are also limited. Must try if traveling to Los Angeles.,4
"Came here around 3pm on a Wednesday and had to wait for roughly 30 minutes. I ordered the spicy miso ramen combo with the pork cutlet bowl. This is a lot of food for one person. I was on the verge of exploding at the end of the meal, and I didn't even finish everything. I really enjoyed the pork cutlet bowl. The meat was extremely flavorful. The ramen was also pretty good.The only complaint I have is the workers. They weren't rude or anything, but they weren't attentive. There was some confusion about our seating. They called our name, but they didn't tell us where to sit. We were just awkwardly standing be middle of the restaurant. It took about ten minutes for out waiter to take our order. Tables that had gotten seated after us got their order taken first. I also asked our waiter for some napkins and he hands me one. He didn't reach in his pocket and grab one napkin. He had a stack of napkins and went out of his way to pick out just one single napkin and hand it to me. The food here was pretty good. I plan on coming back. I just think I happened to have a not so great experience.",3
"Came in one time to ask if they do to go orders and they said yeah. Drove over to get a to go order a week later and they guy told me they allow additional to go orders if you eat there, but not just regular to go orders. Told him they should tell the rest of the staff that since someone told me the wrong thing and he just replied ""yeah we don't do that""",1
Chashu = 5 starsCustomer service = 4 starsCleanliness = 1 starWill probably not return. Ever.,2
"So I just had the weirdest experience. It's not my first time eating ramen here, I actually come all the time. I went tonight and didn't leave a tip because my waitress didn't really check up on me or anything. A worker, not my waitress, comes outside of the restaurant and mind you, I'm already by my car, and proceeds to tell me ""the tip isn't included in your bill"" like okay?! You really had to run after me and pressure me into tipping you? Totally unusual and unprofessional. I don't owe you anything! I loved eating here but I'm sure this will be my last time here.",1
"Came on a date with my bf, the wait time was about 40 minutes but well worth it. It is a hole in the wall in Little Tokyo that can get super packed so that is understandable. Love love LOVE their gyoza! I usually can't finish an entire bowl of ramen unless I haven't eaten for a few hours, but other than that, you'll see me packing a to go box. So what i love about Daikokuya is that I can get a half bowl of ramen. Still delicious, still satisfying! A couple of things that could be improved- it is cash only, and some parts of the bar area are uneven and dirty.",4
"Came here from NY and it is by far the BEST ramen I've had and would easily out-do the ramen spots in NY. Ask for the back fat broth and extra pork when you go there. I only wish they gave a little more broth but either way it was amazing.The wait was about 30-40 minutes... It's not terrible, unless if you're on an empty stomach. Customer service is great and the waiters/waitresses are enthusiastic. It is a bit small so you may have to squeeze but it is definitely worth the try and would for sure make it a regular spot when I visit LA",5
"The ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_two star drop is due to the ridiculous wait to go inside and it being a cash only establishment. Once in me and my gf both ordered the Daikokuya Ramen Special with the Gyoza Appetizer. The noodles were perfect, the broth could have been a little bit more hotter, it was more luke warm. The Gyoza appetizer had great texture and definitely a must order here. All in all it is a good Ramen place if you are in the area and the line isn't crazy. But personally I will try another Ramen place in Little Tokyo.",3
i ordered the Daikoku RamenÃ¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_as their signature RamenÃ¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_i thought it wouldn't go wrongÃ¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_but i was quite disappointedÃ¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_maybe my expectation was too highÃ¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_anywayÃ¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_i don't think i will give this place another try,3
"Don't get me wrong, the ramen is great.They just need to expand. A few years ago I could go in there for dinner and wait maybe 20 mins tops. Now it's like trying to get into a club.",4
"Had to check this place out as I saw so many yelp reviews. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Honestly, I was a little disappointed in the Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It wasn't terrible, but was not worth the hype. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles weren't great and the broth was way too creamy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had the Spicy Miso, but it was not even spicy.The wait for the place was about 20 minutes for 2 of us, so that wasn't bad and the service was pretty solid.",3
"Been wanting to go to this place for years because of all the hype! Went here around noon. When I got my ramen I noticed that my pork was little cold. I told my server and she said it's like that. I didn't think much of it, so I ate it anyways. It was really good! Vey flavorful, rich, and not too salty. Later that night turns out I got food poisoning.",1
"Amazing flavor! Perfect for a rainy day or in the mood for comfort food.Atmosphere:This location is teeny tiny! So yes, you're gonna wait for a seat. How long determines on what time you get there to put your name on the list. There is a host that greets you at the front, not the friendliest by the way, and asks how many in your party. I was in a group of three and we waited about an hour and half (also factor in the wait will always be longer on the weekends). When you proceed to the entrance there is a huge drape you swing back before entering through the door. Extremely tight quarters to the right and the left of you with an isle down the middle. It's simple, cozy and quaint. Food:The order consisted of Spicy Miso Ramen bowl, The Classic Daikoku Ramen 2 bowls and small Teriyaki eel bowl (Unagi-Don). My favorite by far was the Spicy Miso, it had a punch of flavor and spice. The noodles were perfect with a nice consistency, not soggy and not too crunchy. The meat was tender and seasoned well, the egg was excellent, poached just to soft stage. I was also pleased with the other two dishes as well, nicely seasoned and prepared to all our liking. Service:Our waitress was such a cutie. She was helpful, friendly, patient and offered good suggestions. She didn't rush us to order and the wait time to receive our food was minimal. I also appreciated the fact she kept our water glasses full the entire time, checked on us regularly, didn't hover or act anticipatory. The epitome of an excellent waitress, too bad I can't remember her name.Parking:There are parking garages located all around in this area (Little Tokyo) your best bet is to go with these. Metered parking is also available, if you can find it. The traffic here can tend to get a little overwhelming so plan accordingly.Overall experience was enjoyable. I had good company along with good food, which together makes for a marvelous time. The wait and cramped quarters unfortunately lowers the score a little however the food keeps it at a 4 star experience. Definitely will recommend this place to others and I anticipate returning again.",4
Came with a group of 8 and ended up splitting into two groups of four which wasn't a big deal. Was told to get the daikoku kotteri ramen. If my stomach capacity was greater I would have definitely opted for the combo which comes with a small salad and a small bowl of another another dish such as shredded pork!The ramen came out and it smelled amazing. The ramen was chewy and had good texture. But it did stick together into a big clump and needed to be separated. The meat was really tender. The soup was so flavorful. Getting it with kotteri definitely added to the flavor and I loved that there was a good broth to noodle ratio! I was so stuffed afterwards. Little did I know there were different sizes of ramen! If you're not that hungry I would definitely opt for the small option. I wish I knew about the sizes but the ramen was so delicious I have no regrets. This place in my opinion is better than momofuku and a better value at around 10$ a bowl! What a bargain!,5
Got to the place right when they opened and I finally don't have to wait. The ramen with fatback was amazing! I felt my arteries clogging up each time I tasted the broth but totally worth it. Wish the place wasn't always packed ):,5
Really good ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their fried rice just whatever though.,5
"Decent ramen. Decent prices. Long wait. Living in Japan for a few years, we are very picky on ramen. This place isn't 100% authentic but pretty close. The noodles were cooked just right and the soup base wasn't bad. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have to recommend the egg, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the flavor is on point. Only downside is street parking which can be hit or miss and the long wait. We only waited about 25 mins but I read other reviews where they waited about 1 to 2 hours. That's crazy! Not sure also if it's bc we went during the summer and in the middle of the day but the restaurant was so hot!! On top of eating hot ramen and the temperature, it was making everyone in our group not feel well.",4
"So, I decided to try to find the best tonkotsu ramen in the USA based on many lists and website and rank them all. I made a spreadsheet of all the locations and tried them in a small time span (12 months) so that I can better recall and compare them more accurately. I scored them equally on 4 parameters: broth, noodles, chachu, and egg. I am based in Los Angeles (which is the second largerst population of Japanases Americans behind Hawaii).

The Best ! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ I cannot add anything else positive that other reviews haven't already covered.One recommendation I have to all of the people mentioning the wait time; ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_you aren't that important ... deal with it!,5
"I recommend the daikon ramen and takoyaki, the interior is small, but cozy, came at 11 AM when they opened, make sure to get there early before it gets full!",5
"Short and sweet, this ramen restaurant is almost always crowded, it's hot during the summer but service is great and the ramen is outstanding. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ You won't regret eating here, even if the wait is long.",4
"Don't know about other people but this is my place for ramen. Daikokuya ramen and the fried rice, hits the spot every time. The pork broth is hearty and savory and is coupled with the perfectly cook meat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's so filling, it can be tough to finish a bowl because of all the sodium. But don't play around and try other things or the miso, this place is for the daikokuya special. Not to say the rest of the menu is terrible but go for what they're known for and not stuff like the rolls, etc.",5
"You don't need another review to tell you how famous and popular this ramen place is. However, if you expect the ""whole"" dining experience, I don't think you will disagree with my rating here.Food - 2.5 starsthe broth was its typical meaty and intense. I do prefer the Spicy Miso Ramen, which was more balanced with the hint of ginger. The Daikoku Specialty Ramen was very disappointing. It had the very distinct ammonia oder (this happens when the ramen chef did not get rid of the boiling water from the noodle) and its broth, unfortunately tasted salty to me.Accessories - 4 starseach bowl of ramen came with a whole egg (typically it is only half an egg), which was very yummy and generous! Bamboo shoot and sliced green onion were great too.Environment - 3 starsgreasy and slippery floor. They need to take care of the air ventilation system as well.Service - 3 starsWe waited 40 minutes on a Monday night. Literally, late night around 11 pm. Service was just okay. CASH only here!On a more general note: Unless you insist on visiting the ORIGINAL/ FIRST Daikokuya Ramen Store, I strongly recommend you visit other Daikokuya otherwise to enjoy a much more pleasant dining experience where you can expect a shorter line, better service, more clean as far as the dining place and your ramen noodle. The noodle I had in other Daikokuya did not come with the annoying ammonia odor. I believe it is because the chefs in other Daikokuya are not as busy/ careless as the ones in the original store.",3
"Delicious hot ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place always hits the spot. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait can get ridiculous, but lucky for us we came a few minutes before opening. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We waited a few minutes in line and were seated right when they opened! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Kinda sucks if you still have to wait for the first people to finish eating to get seated... But it's not too bad. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Anyway, the service was decent and the food was really good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I always order the same thing when I come here... Daikoku Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I should remember the order the half size. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My eyes are bigger than my stomach; I can never finish the regular order... But i want to! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ordered:--- Daikoku Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_$9.50This is their famous and most popular ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Savory, perfectly flavored tonkotsu soup based infused with their secret blended soy sauce... yummm! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen is cooked to a perfect firmness! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Topped with kurobuta pork belly chashu, bean sprouts, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Perfect for a cold night! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I really enjoy eating their ramen, but i don't enjoy the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place does not have to go orders and only accepts cash! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_CASH ONLY! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Boo... Luckily there's a shop next door that offers cash back. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_:) get some hi-chew for later.",4
"Confession: I'd never had actual ramen before. Those Maruchan ramen packages that got me through college were the closest I'd ever gotten. So I can't speak as an experienced ramen consumer. But this was so good! The Daikoku ramen had wonderful broth, great noodles, tender pork, perfect little egg.And it's a lot of food. I was FULL after half the bowl, so I took the rest home and now have a great lunch ready for me the next day!The wait, as many people have said, can get long. I went on a Monday night, and the wait was roughly 40 minutes. But I didn't mind at all! I put my name down, went to one of the bars down the street, grabbed a quick drink, came back, and only really waited for 7 minutes.",5
The wait has become unbearable to the point that I am considering other shops at this time. Shin Sen Gumi seems to be another alternative but I haven't tried their ramen yet. Both shops serve the same milky tonkotsu style (milky pork broth) ramen. I also heard that Men Oh Tokushima Ramen is also good but it's a different version from Daikokuya's or Shin Sen Gumi. I might try that as well. The goal is not having to wait an hour to get a meal. That's just ridiculous.I'm docking one star from my original rating just because the wait has become so intolerable at this point.,3
So very good! Flavors that shine is layer upon layer. Yes the line is long but it is worth it.,4
"For just $10~ you get a pretty big portion of some really great tasting ramen..I mean from the broth to the noodles to the chashu (pork), everything was on point. I would have given this place a 5 star but I will explain why not in a bit..This place is a magical hole in the wall located in DTLA and is very busy. The store is very small but has a good homey feeling to it. Now for the food! I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen because I love my spicy foods! My friends ordered the original Daikoku ramen bowl. I tasted both and ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the broths were savory and perfect. Our food came out in a timely manner...but that was the only service we received for the night...This place definitely needs better customer service because we were not once checked up on for refills or asked how we were doing. We only got our food and our check. As for the waiting system, it definitely needs a little work on and by that I mean the host that was calling out the numbers...she was too quiet and was absolutely rude. It was like she tried to dodge all my friends questions and give the rudest look whenever we would ask something.Oh well...I enjoyed the food, but some decent customer service would have been a cherry on top!",4
"So check it I came here with a group of friends and the place is super small so we get seated (it's always packed btw) we order our food and I was like ""damn this shiii goood asf ) it really is but then.. the bill came. They don't let you know that they already charge gratuity BUT they didn't even give good service the service was so bad. So as we're walking out some lady was like omfg there's a roach on my arm!!! And we looked and there was a damn roach the size of a quarter on her arm we ran out and never looked back. Ask me when I'll go back",2
"Came here at the busiest time for a table for two and waited for around 1.5 hours. You have to be there if they call your name or they will cross your name out, but you can kind of estimate the wait time and stroll around the shops in Little Tokyo though. The wait was definitely worth it though because the Daikokuya ramen was the BEST ramen I've ever had (and I try a lot of ramen). The noodles were of perfect firmness, the pork belly just melts in your mouth, and that soft-boiled egg with the creamy yolk. The broth was really rich and filled with umami and such a waste if you don't finish it. I emptied my whole bowl although I was eating all throughout Little Tokyo beforehand. The ramen pairs really well with a glass of refreshing beer. They refrigerate the entire drinking glass with the beer so the it undiluted and stays cold throughout your whole meal.The shop itself is pretty small but it gives off a really cozy feeling. The food came quickly and service was quick which was great! Since the shop isn't in a plaza, most people park on the streets or in the parking structures in Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would definitely coming back again next time for the ramen and 12/10 would recommend! Bring snack while waiting if you're super hungry and it's CASH ONLY so be prepared!!",5
Had a piece of nail and a suspicious piece of meat that's not chicken in my fried rice. Disgusting!,1
"Decent service but it was hardly busy on a Wed. a day after Valentines Day! BF took me here and the food was amazing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I love their fried rice... took extra home.. my only complaint was that the last booth towards the back needs to be reupholstered ASAP!! Like seriously and the tables were leaned to the point our miso soup was slowly moving away from us... lol as if it was alive and it knew it's eventual fate! I love the old school charm and eclecticism of the decor but the functionality of the booth and the feeling of ""run downness"" is in need of improvement.",4
They are super packed but totally worth it! The wait was enjoyable because you can walk around a bit or just hang out. I went late at night. The ramen was amazing. Better than any ive had at sushi places back home in san bernardino. I dont likw that the booths are so squished but i mean the bar is there so its fine. Cant wait to go again. And omg that plum wine!!!!!,5
This place is very small and the wait is very long. The food was good and the servers were nice but I wouldn't wait an hour again to sit at a cramped bar and try to eat.,3
"I made it my mission to try LA's most famous ramen joint and it was definitely worth the wait. At the moment I may have felt differently but once the broth touched my lips the over hour wait was a distant memory. With most ramen places, it is small and quaint and they do not take reservations. They have a running list that you write down your name and how many people in your party and they call out names from the list from top to bottom once tables clear out. If you happen to not be there when they call you name you are SOL. They generally quote an hour wait but there's no way of telling.I ordered the fried gyoza to start off with. It was prepared differently than what I was use to but they were still delicious. The top was crispy and the bottom more of a steamed texture. The filling was a good flavorful moist pork concoction. Now the ramen: I ordered the classic Daikokuya Ramen. With most ramen I have tried they are always so salty, Daikokuya Ramen however was not and it was unbelievably delicious. Broth was rich and delicate all at the same time. I was amazed how non-salty it was and the aftertaste was almost creamy tasting. The noodles were cooked on point. Not hard nor soggy but cooked with a bite still in them almost like al dente. The pork melted in your mouth and the egg was the perfect soft boiled.Being from Washington, DC my favorite local ramen spot is Toki Underground. Both Toki and Daikokuya are amazingly delicious but are very different. I can't compare the two broths but both are 5 stars in my book. Unfortunately Ippudo in NYC doesn't rank among the best.",5
"The wait was worth it... My friend, not so much, but he soon forgot about it once he tried the Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tried to bring him here once and he couldn't take the wait so we went down the street, it was okay, but I told him it's not the same as Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So we did the following week wait and wait and wait till we finally got our number called. The ramen is seductive. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's amazing, but it's very salty and you'll be wanting to drink gallons of water later, but heck I didn't mind and I'll be stoppin by again and again.",4
"Their house special Ramen is delightful in its own way, though definitely is not the cheapest option around. Complemented with some gyoza, It makes for a nice meal, though part of me wishes I had opted to either a different place for my money's worth.",3
Wait is much longer than expected (20 minutes turned into an hour) but the food is incredible! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Will definitely come back for more,4
"I'm literally obsessed with this place. The first time I went was years ago and I had fallen off the ramen game. Recently I went to a ramen place in Chicago and remembered Daikokuya in LA. Their tonkotsu is insane. It's so rich and full of flavor I went back again last night to have it again after going last week. I switch the ramen noodles out for the noodles in the miso. They're thicker. My chick got the tomato broth vegan ramen which I must say was surprisingly amazing. The staff is fantastic and very knowledgeable. The ambiance is very pleasing. I really appreciate old tin advertisement, which they have a lot of and are in Japanese. I want them haha. If anyone reads this and has any laying around hit me up! Lol. Anyways, if you haven't been here you're not human. Just kidding, but haven't lived yet. Please go!",5
"I can literally die happy now. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen was f***ing FANTASTIC!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'm going to come back like every week! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My goodness, I haven't had such fantastic ramen anywhere!",5
"To me, good ramen is all about the broth. Whether it's pork, soy sauce or miso based; if the broth isn't good, the ramen isn't good.Their pork based broth is one of the best. So rich, velvety, stomach coating goodness... It's as if the essence of the pig was put in that bowl. As if that can't get any better, you can order it kotteri style which gives it that extra something (and by something, i mean fat for you health conscious). The rest of the ingredients can be mediocre and you still have an above average bowl of ramen thanks to that broth.",4
"My family and I recent just tried this place out while shopping around. It wasn't too busy, but there were quite some people in there. We were seated immediately and our orders were taken. The menu is quite limited to obviously ramen and maybe some other things, but you get a quite selection of different types of ramen.As our orders were placed, it did take some time to get to us, but we didn't mind the wait. The ramen was probably one of the best I've had! The noodles are super, super good and the broth of the soup isn't salty at all; I think that's what I enjoyed a lot about this ramen place. The broth is the perfect flavor! Parking is a little bit hard, there is a parking structure across the street and street parking! We were lucky enough to get street parking. They don't offer take out because they want you to get the full experience which I totally understand!",4
Best ramen in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_True to traditional ramen in Japan. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just be prepared to wait 45 minutes to 1:30 if visiting during prime time.,4
"Eats: Daikoku ramen + extra chasu porkTakes: I've had my share of ramens, especially if I'm with the bf. This is actually a ramen place I'd stop by if I was in the LA area. The broth wasn't overly salty like other places. I loved the flavor and even though it doesn't come in a spicy version, you can definitely make it spicy by adding the chili oil. Be careful because a squeeze of that can go a long way! The chasu pork had the melt in your mouth texture-yes, the kind that makes you close your eyes and just savor your food. All of the other components of the ramen-chijire style egg noodles, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, and sesame seeds all complemented the delicious broth! The bf did try the spicy miso during a previous visit, but although that was good, he'd still choose the daikoku ramen over the spicy miso in terms of flavor.Service: The bf actually ordered the tonkatsu for us to share, but we didn't receive it during the meal. When the bill came, it actually wasn't even listed. It wasn't really a problem for us since we were both already full with our ramens. Other than that, service was fine. They do try to accommodate you the best they can for a restaurant that is so small but has a large multitude of customers.Wait time: Party of 2 for a Friday night around 8pm was about an hour. Yes, the wait was worth it. In the mean time, you can explore Little Tokyo while you're waiting. A couple stores were already closed during that time.Parking: You could park in the nearby parking garage and pay the parking fee, but both of us were lucky to find street parking for free! The bouncer at one of the lounges was so nice. I hate parallel parking, but he even directed me that I was clear when I was adjusting my parking between two vehicles.Price: About $23 for 2 Daikoku ramens, 1 order of extra chasu pork, and 1 order of extra egg. *Cash only, and no to go orders!*Bottom line: Go here for your ramen fix!Highly recommended.",5
"Gluten-free friends: This is not the restaurant for you. There is nothing for you here. Same for friends with soy allergies. And much like most restaurants in Japan, they do not accommodate or substitute. That said, this place does a few things right. The broth and noodles. They're a bit on the saltier side where everything taste like they're drenched in salt/water/msg, but that said, it's delicious. Consistency of the noodles are good-- I prefer these to the west side's Tsujita. If gluten didn't make me so sick, I would probably eat here a few times a year. The rice bowls leave something to be desired, however. Everything from their appetizers to rice bowls tastes very pre-made and flavorless. Just salty and sweet. I would not recommend getting anything else besides ramen &amp; Tuskemen.",4
"An update to my review from 2012: I'm happy to report that Daikokuya is consistently delicious.As a result of being on East Coast time, we were able to get here early and were the 2nd group of people in line. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_By 10:55AM, the line was already halfway down the block! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_That's when you know it's good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There are a few locations throughout LA area, but this location was on our way down SoCal so we came back here. The boyfriend and I started with the takoyaki and the handmade gyoza. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would probably opt out of the takoyaki the next time around and just get 2 gyoza dishes because they were THAT good! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was rich, the noodles were al dente, and the sides that we ordered added onto the deliciousness factor.Service is quick and efficient due to the high table/seating turnover.",5
One of the best ramen place in LA! A little hole in the wall that is always crowded. I came here around 6pm and waited about 10 mins. We ordered:- Daikoku Ramen - definitely hit the spot on a cold night. My friend almost lick the bowl because the soup was just that good.- Spicy Miso Ramen - It was not spicy at all but the meat just melt in your mouth. I love the fact that it didn't make me feel so heavy afterwards. Parking: street parking or parking structure.Price: $ - CASH ONLY. Wait: Come early to avoid the lunch/dinner rush hours!!,4
"It doesn't matter how many times I go here, it never seize to amaze me. Anything I try from here is absolutely amazing. From the broth to even the hard boiled egg in the ramen is good. Now this place is located in little tokyo. Parking wise, there is a public parking across from the place. The place is quite small and super tight, but it extends all the way to the back. Yes they have bathrooms and an ATM machine because it's a cash only place. The only thing I don't like is the hungry people staring at you and your party. For once I would like to sit and talk after my meal, but people make faces because there's a ton of people waiting outside and inside. Now don't let this discourage you because this place is worth it. Try the combos. They're good enough for two people if you're not starving. The spicy miso is good or the original. Try the shredded pork bowl because it will blow your mind.",5
"Easily the best ramen I've ever had in my life. (I haven't been to Japan yet so no unfair review here!) the broth, noodles, decor just felt so authentic. They are cash only! The prices are amazing. I'm from NYC so any kind of good ramen places we have are extremely overpriced. I couldn't believe I found this place and was lucky to try it before I left L.A. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for reasonably priced authentic ramen.",5
"My first Japanese ramen was from this place. My friends and I waited nearly two hours during winter at night and oh my, after that wait... the Ramen was great.Few years later, I happened to park near little tokyo and I had to revisit. Pros:1. the gyoza is great. I am not an expert in gyoza as I usually eat korean or Chinese dumplings etc but they were surprisingly filling and meaty. 4/52. Ramen: ordered speciality ramen and the spicy miso ramen. Both tasted really good. I find that their Ramen is not extremely salty as other places. 5/53. Tempura: the Tempura was soft and juicy. Crunchy outside and so moist inside. Only 3 prawns and the rests are vegies which I am ok with. 4/5Cons: 1. The wait: I still waited 30-40 mins to be seated on Wednesday at 5pm!2. The bathroom:Only one for a lady and one for a man. The bathroom is pretty run down. Although the theme of the restaurant is very retro and vintage vibe. I wish the bathroom is pristine and clean.3. Tonkatsudon (pork cutlet rice bowl) isn't that great. I've eaten better ones before. 3/5I think it is worth a visit if you are near by and it is not lunch nor dinner time. The food is delicious. They do have other branches so I would not drive all the way to downtown LA just for this. Tip: I like to order extra corn, chashu and bean sprouts. Haha I know I like to have it all!",4
"Best ramen ever!The first time we came, we waited for 3 hours long and it was worth the wait! The salty and milky coloured Daikoku Ramen was to die for! The egg was cooked perfectly, the sweet chashu pork helps balance the saltiness of the broth and the noodles were thin and chewy, perfect at every bite! Another highlight of our dinner was the tofu nugget. They are deep fried tofu with vegetables (edamame and carrots), served alongside a sweet chilli sauce. The tenderness of the tofu won everyone's heart!We came back two days later and had our stomachs filled again with the best ramen in DTLA!",5
"After waiting over an hour to be seated, I realized that they skipped us and seated a party after us on the waitlist. We are very patient people, and we wanted to try their self-proclaimed ""best Ramen in town"". To my disappointment, it was the worst Ramen I ever had. I ordered the Tsukemen. The broth was extremely salty, and the pork was very fatty. Moreover, the noodles were rubbery and undercooked. The restaurant is small and very busy, so you'll feel rushed.",1
Long wait. Very long. Was it worth it. Maybe maybe not. Spicy miso ramen was very good. But I must say the star of the dinner for me was the order of gyoza we had as an appetizer. For about $6 you get 5 of them with the perfect sauce to dip them in. Well worth the $6 and then some. Noodles have the perfect consistency and the egg it comes with is perfectly cooked. I do wish the broth had a little more flavor. But overall good ramen! Just maybe better on a weekday when there isn't a 2 hour wait,4
"It was pretty good ramen. The wait wasn't long on a Friday evening around 10 pm. I wish the standard ramen included more toppings. Overall, the experience was good. I can't say it's authentic, because I mean this is LA... not Japan lol. But the taste was there and it satisfied the craving. I would come here again especially because they're open late and the customer service is top notch. Definitely a satisfying check off your ramen shop list.",4
"BOMB. I got the spicy miso ramen &amp; it was a big portion. Comes with a soy flavored egg &amp; sliced pork. They have some condiments ready for you on the table so you can adjust the ramen to your taste. The spicy miso isn't that spicy, however, but I eat hella spicy things so maybe it's just me. Poured almost half of the chili powder in my bowl and I was good to go",5
"My boyfriend and I have been on a ramen kick lately so since we had the time, we decided to check this place out. We arrived around 1:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon and there was about a 45 min wait. It's a small place, and it was packed, people waiting inside and outside on the sidewalk as well. Prices were pretty good, especially for how much food you get.I ordered the daikoku ramen combo with a teriyaki chicken bowl, and my bf opted for the spicy miso ramen. I really liked mine, the broth was hearty and very flavorful, not too salty like other places I've been. The egg was cooked well and the pork was so tender that it shredded at just a light touch of my chop sticks. My bf enjoyed the spicy miso ramen as well, although it wasn't as spicy as he'd hoped, even after he added the chili oil and chili powder. Over all, I'd say it was worth the wait. We left so full we thought we were going to have to roll to our car.",5
"I have had better Ramen but Daikokuya is acceptable. I ordered the Daikoku Ramen which has a tonkotsu soup base. I should have probably ordered the spicy miso ramen for some more kick. It is a ton of food if you want to add a rice bowl to make a combination. However, the chicken bowl I had was a little dry so I ended up not eating much of it. There is usually a line for this spot. We still had to wait an hour even though it was 3 PM in the afternoon on Friday.",3
"Honestly, the best ramen place in LA. Although they only accept cash and the wait can get pretty long, trust me when I say that it is worth it!",5
"The food is not that wow, the noodle was hard but the service is good. The waiting is a pain. I think this ramen is overrated. I've been tasted better ramen in New York.",3
The lines are definitely quick to form so the best time to go is 15 minutes before open time. I went 15 minutes before opening on Friday and there was a line. When I left there was at least five parties waiting for a table. The ramen good and not too salty which was surprising. I also tried the gyoza and the Cali roll. Both are not the greatest but still good. The service is super quick but they aren't very attentive. No one checked in on us after taking the order but that was fine. Definitely worth trying out but not sure if it's worth a wait for longer than 30 minutes.,4
"I'm pretty sure the reviews are repetitive after 3000 reviews, and now just ridiculously redundant as it approaches 6000 reviews. It's just damn good ramen. It's ramen with a reputation. But that wait.. oh the wait. Don't come hungry but come to eat. You know what I mean? Don't follow my cue by showing up at 7 pm on a Saturday night. You want me to be honest? 1 hour and 30 minutes before we were seated. I don't know if it was insanity motivated by hunger that didn't allow the common sense in me to leave and eat elsewhere. It really is a downer that there are no reservations or no pagers or text messages to let you know your table is ready. You are either present with your entire group when your name is called or not. So essentially you are tethered to the restaurant while you wait. I really wanted the BF to try their ramen. Good thing he was impressed or I could've been in trouble. So that being said, if you can make it here at an off hour and only have to wait 20 minutes, praise to the ramen people above. Okay wait time rant over. Because despite it, the ramen still makes this 5-star worthy. The spicy miso is perfect. The texture of the noodles (al dente and slightly chewy), the salt and fat content of the broth, the butter-y quality to the pork belly chashu, the marinated egg--everything is just right. I get conflicted about trying the kotteri flavor, which is the fattier version. Some say it tastes better, but I feel the original Daikoku has enough fat as is. Other than the ramen, don't forget the oh-so satisfying takoyaki. A few other rules:-No to-go orders-Cash only",5
"I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and it was really really good. The noodles had the right texture in terms of softness. The soup itself isn't too spicy but it does have a little kick to it. The pork is nice and tender and the egg tastes so good. I went last night and it was really hot inside. However, it was a really hot summer night so maybe that's why. It just felt a bit stuffy inside especially because it's so small. The service was good too considering how many other people go there. Overall,I would definitely recommend eating there!",4
"Dayum-- does this spot have a wait! I honestly think I got pregnant while waiting. I'm not kidding. I suggest bringing some Legos or condoms or something, bc this wait is no joke. You know what is a joke? How good this place is. It's honestly a joke. Make sure you order the shredded pork bowl. I shred the gnar every weekend, and this bowl shreds so much harder than I do. It's like the Eddie Van Halen of rice bowls! The ramen is decent. Honestly, overhyped, but I'd go back for the Tsukemen (which I did not get to try bc my wife has a low tolerance for spice. What a silly).",4
"This place is alright. Daikoku Ramen broth tastes pretty special, but not great enough to rave about. Solid harmony of ingredients, but not mind-blowing. Tsukemen was yummy. Very similar to the regular Daikoku Ramen. The gyoza is good. I'd get it again. Beef bowl is not recommended. It was whatever.All in all, decent. I'll come again to try more stuff. The temporary new items looked pretty interesting so most likely going to try those.",3
"Great spot to hit after some drinks. Dont mind the wait, write your name and walk arround grab a beer and come back. The food is great. Will def be coming back. #Ramen",5
"It took us one hour to wait in line.it really tastes so so, I mean it doesn't worth the wait.and by the way one of the waitresses has a really poor service Ã¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_terrible attitude",2
"I came here on a Sunday around 4pm and only waited 10 minutes!I'll admit at first bite, I wasn't too impressed. But the more I ate the ramen, I enjoyed the noodles and broth A LOT. What I think is really amazing here is the chashu pork that they use. It is seriously melt in your mouth goodness! I would definitely come back here again...although I wouldn't want to wait in the typical hour long wait.",4
"Ok. I DID NOT stand in line.I came back mid day, after lunch and before dinner, like 4pm and got seated within 10 minutes.And yes, I'm impressed. Noodles were PERFECT. Tampopo quality.Broth also, perhaps the best I've ever had.The egg was perfect.Service was 100% functional; to the point I was in and so far I didn't have a chance to review the bathroom!I'm going to have go back.",5
"When some people say that Daikokuya has some of the best ramen in LA, they're right! I was looking for some good ramen and had to try Daikokuya after reading the rave reviews on Yelp. A friend and I decided to check it out for some late night grub, so we drove into Little Tokyo and found some street parking. When we arrived at the little hole-in-the-wall restaurant, I was surprised to find a line at 10pm on a Monday night! There were just a few small parties before us, so we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes before we were seated at the bar, which was fine since it was just two of us. The setup and decor was charming and reminded me of ramen shops in Japan. A server quickly greeted us and took our order within a few minutes. I was craving tsukemen, but had to try the daikoku kotteri ramen since that's what people were raving about. Since it's Lent season, my friend was eating vegetarian, and there were many options for him, including vegetable tempura, yakisoba, and sushi (avocado, cucumber). He opted for the avocado sushi, which actually included some big chunks of avocado in an inside out maki style. He enjoyed it quite a bit with the ginger and wasabi that accompanied the sushi.I absolutely LOVED the daikoku kotteri ramen. The broth had good depth of savory flavor, and the big bowl of soup included pork, a whole soft boiled egg (so good with the runny yolk!), green onions, and fresh noodles. I could have had the noodles slightly firmer for my taste, but they definitely were not mushy. I added some generous dollops of garlic paste (hey, it's tasty and good for you!) and some shakes of pepper flakes. And I agree with the many reviews before me - Daikokuya has some of the best ramen I've ever had!I don't live in LA, so sadly it'll be a while before I return to Daikokuya. Until then, I will dream of the ramen and will definitely return on my next trip to lala land.",5
"Two things I noticed:CASH ONLYDID THEY RAISE THE PRICE?!Still this place is hip. I'm not sure if I would ever come here during rush hour. I don't like waiting 1 hour in line. But other than that I like Japanese friendliness, who doesn't. The service is accordingly good and the Ramen is delicious.I just feel like I could get this kind of Ramen anywhere else. There is nothing remarkable or make it stands out worth waiting a day in line. I'm sure Daikokuya the name itself attracts customers.",3
"My brother said he wanted to try this place. Our go-to ramen place is Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata Ramen about a block away. We love that place. I've been to Daikokuya before and frankly, it wasn't impressive. So we tried again... we got lucky that the line wasn't that bad. We read a few manga while waiting inside.Then came our order. I think it was a bad day at the kitchen. The fried rice was too salty and the ramen was, to be totally honest, was horrible. The broth was oily, the noodles were gummy and stuck together, and there was no taste. I was blown away at how bad it was. So unless I have out of town family and friends visiting and they want to try this place, that's the only time I'll come back here.",2
"I had somewhat high expectations of this place after reading the reviews. My boyfriend and I came here on a saturday night at around 7:45 and probably sat around like 9:15. There were about 20 people ahead of us, and by the time we were 4th in line there were another 25 after us! This place is crazy popular. A few people walking by stated that this is a really good ramen place, or even one of the best ramen places theyve been to which made me even more excited!Its a pretty small restaurants. Most groups of 6 ppl had an extra stool brought out for the sixth person. Groups of 2-3 were sat around the bar. The menu is pretty limited. I got the takoyaki and the daikoku ramen. The takoyaki was good, they put a mountain of fish flakes on top so you can't even see the takoyaki at first. The daikoku broth was pretty plain in my opinion...I ended up putting a lot of japanese chili powder and a couple scoops of their garlic paste. I do like their soft boiled egg though! The noodles were a little harder than I like. The portions for the noodles are pretty big by the way! My boyfriend ordered extra noodles and we were both trying to finish it. I ended up with leftovers and brought it back.Service was good! But overall, I would not come back again. Not really worth it..I feel like there are definitely better ramen places out there. The broth was a big bummer for me.",2
I had the daikoku ramen with kotteri flavor and it was amazing!! The additional flavor really added to it and I have no complaints! We got there when it opened at 11 and we're seated at the bar immediately !,5
"Fabulous ramen, friendly service for such a crowded little place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Probably one of the best deals in town!",5
"Daikokuya is located under a yellow awning. As expected, there was a long wait. When we were finally seated about an hour later, I ordered the signature Daikoko ramen. The tonkotsu soup base is made from pork bone. I also asked for the richer kotteri flavor for the soup base. The broth was creamy and flavorful. The chasu is made from Kurobuta pork belly. There was also a boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, sesame seeds, and oodles of noodles. I wasn't able to finish all of it. Ramen lovers need to try this place, but I won't say it's the best ramen I've had.If you decide to dine here, be aware there are homeless people wandering about. One guy even came into the restaurant asking people for money.",4
"Quick service. Just your typical ramen eatery environment and ambiance. The bowls were pretty large and filling, very flavorful and the meat is super tender and breaks apart easily; only tiny thing is the noodles seemed a bit undercooked and was not as tender as I've had. Overall a good place to eat at!",4
"Came here on a Sunday around 1:00am with a friend that lives in LA.Interior-very small has couple booth seatings and size is about the same as marugame monzo next doorFood-ordered the spicy miso with pork rice combo with an asahi. the pork rice was amazing. meat was really tender and i enjoyed it as a combo. For the ramen i was disappointed. The soup base was good but not worth waiting in line good. My noodles were undercooked and some of the bites i've had were extremely hard. It is not what i expected coming from a well-known ramen house.Dining experience-it was extremely crammed for me. The place was really small but the most annoying thing was that it was really hot in there. before I got my food, i was sweating and while i was eating my ramen i was soaking wet. if a place serves warm based soup, they are suppose to keep the dining room very cooled so that the customers can enjoy their meal imo. it was a reallypoor experience for me.Overall-for the price/wait/quality/food this place is not a 4-5 star restaurant. It was more of a 3.5 stars for me and definitely not worth the long wait. Quality of food is good, just ramen was undercooked. Price is pretty fair.CASH ONLY RESTAURANT AND NEXT DOOR GIVES CASH BACK IF YOU GUYS ARE DESPERATE fo that cash.",3
Probably the best ramen I've had to date. Broth was delicious and pork melts in your mouth. Noodles had a great consistency and services was good.,5
"Let's get one thing straight: Daikokuya has great food. I'm not a big ramen eater, but this place gets it right, otherwise, people wouldn't be waiting for an hour for $10 ramen. That being said, I'm really turned off by the service here. Call it cultural difference, or the fact that they have an endless line of customers on any given day, but these employees really alienate you. Asking for an extra bowl is like asking them for a kidney transplant. Then they constantly check on you not to see if you need anything, but to see if they can take anything away to expedite the process of getting you out the door.Now that's aside, man this place really has some great broth and fresh-tasting noodles. We all got the daikokuya ramen with kotteri broth. Talk about perfection, especially since we were feeling under the weather on a cold, windy night. We also ordered the full size shredded pork bowl, which was delicious with the horseradish and pink pickled veggies. I've previously had their chicken and egg over rice as well, which I remember loving some years ago. I recommend coming here if you've never been, but in terms of a go-to regular spot, I'd look for other options, especially since there's so many in LA. Cash only, free street parking after 8pm, limited waiting room inside, so bundle up if it's cold outside.",3
"I came here on a Saturday night, the wait was about 45 minutes for 2 people. It's a very small restaurant located in Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We put our name down and walked around. They don't take your phone number to call you when it's your turn, so make sure you don't go too far or too long. I like to eat spicy so ordered the Spicy Miso Soup and it was delicious. The broth, the noodles, the eggs, and the meat, everything were so good. One of the best ramen I had. The food came out pretty fast. I would definitely come back again. This is a CASH ONLY restaurant.",5
"Maybe because I live in China and there are a lot of good ramen places, (especially in Japan and HK) I just don't understand why people wait for an hour to eat at this place. Food was good but not amazing. One good thing was that the soup wasn't that oily, not salty, however I think the whole bowl of noodle just needs more flavor.",3
"I'm a ramen snob and this is my favorite ramen place! I always make an effort to eat here when I visit my family in LA. The line is always long. And the driving and parking is chaotic too. But it is so worth it. I've waited almost two hours once but every bite of my noodles and dishes made it all better by the end of the day. Because I waited so long, I like to order appetizers along with my ramen with extra egg, corn, pork, and seaweed. I won't describe any further since this place has over 6000 reviews, but it's the best bowl of ramen I have ever had.",5
"The legendary Ramen stop. Don't let the line outside deter you. Turn around is fast (just pay close attention to them calling out, you snooze - you loose) First time there and will always return if we are in LA. The chewy noodles (none of that curly s***) and the most flavorful, rich, umami heaven: broth. We cried when the bowl was empty. For someone that has ramen every chance I get, I can tell you that you won't be disappointed. CASH ONLY tho. Slurp your way to heaven my friends!",5
Ordered the Daikoku ramen and it was sooooo good. Added the garlic paste and demolished the bowl. Our server was so nice as well. Loved it all. Closes late. Great place.,5
"Just ate here and needed to write this review. I just got there at 11 when it opened and there was already a line. Everything was fine till I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen and water to drink. When I got my ramen, there was like nothing inside(you cant see anything under the soup) and my egg wasnt even cut for me... im not sure if this is how its supposed to be but ive had tons of ramen in NYC and they totally top Daikokuya Ramen. As for the taste, its O.K. not good but def not bad. Just AVERAGE. There isnt a lot of flavor(maybe cause they dont use MSG but if thats the case i appreciate it) and my ramen bowl just looked super sad when i got it.When i was walking out, clearly my ramen was much worse than others since they had FULL bowls and everything. Maybe they all ordered extra noodles but i doubt it.Overall: BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE/ Just barely average Ramen / nothing special /Terrible portion size for me at least.",2
"Some of the best ramen broth and noddles I have ever had. Unfortunately there were some complications. The Chashu was cold and the center of my miso egg was cold as well. Felling the Chashu would be a huge improvement, and highly suggested.",3
This place is greatThe ramen is bombAnd they had a veggie option for my friends The green tea drink is very refreshing,5
One of the best spots in LA for Ramen! just be prepared to wait and bring cash because they dont take cards. when I say be prepared to wait I mean it may be an hour or two before you get to eat. Once you finally get in to eat you wont be disappointed.,4
"Awesome spot, randomly discovered while in downtown. Great Ramen, large portions, good prices and good service. Their gyoza is amazing!!",5
I love this place!! The wait time may be long but it's always worth it. The food is consistent every single time. If you are a first time goer I would recommend the daikokuya ramen (ask with the fatty broth) but those who are a bit more adventurous the spicy miso ramen is top notch fav. So delicious. Not only is their ramen good but since our their side dishes such as their takoyaki and crispy made to order tempura are great to order. I've been here multiple times with friends and family and we enjoy the good and the vibes every single time.,5
"Went here on a recommendation and did not regret it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I didnt mind the 30 minute wait becuase their house ramen, the Daikokuya Ramen was worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_WIll definitely be back to try more of their dishes.",5
"The goal was to give a 3.5 star, but I rounded upward to provide an overall rating of 4 stars. Here's why:Cons: The wait was extremely long! We were a group of 5 and arrived at the location around 7:35 p.m on a Sunday evening. Now, I will be fair and say that I presumed a wait of at least 30 min since it we were going on a weekend night. However, the wait was far beyond my expectation. The total wait time was 1 hour and 20 minutes! I know the location is small, but sheesh! All i'm saying is: if you are going on a weekend night, be prepared for a 1-hour wait at least. Usually, when people have to wait over an hour to eat at any restaurant, they usually throw in a perk like free fries while you wait outside in the freezing cold, or some other appetizer to make you feel good about wasting your precious time. This did not happen. I did not expect for it to happen, but it would have been a nice touch. Pros:The food is delicious!! The fried rice is some of the best fried rice I HAVE EVER HAD! This is saying a lot since I consider myself an epicure. I got the combo: Ramen (reg. not spicy) + fried rice +salad and it was so tasty! SUGGESTION: They charge extra for the spicy ramen. Go for the regular ramen and add spice with the sriracha sauce!Waiter was funny and personable. He wore glasses without lenses and sang to us as he took our order! This guy made my day! I forget his name but he had long dark hair (in braids). Whoever you are, keep making people smile and laugh. He also provided great service.The wait to receive the food was very short! Less than 15 minutes for 5 people! Not bad, eh?!",4
"This food is simply amazing and addictive. I think they put some secret narcotics cause it's just unbelievably addictive. The ramen is for sure the best in the whole state. Try their famous combination with their signature ramen and the fried pork. I'm not even a fan of pork, but whatever they make is simply incredible.",5
"When I'm craving ramen, Daikokuya is my first choice! I recently became a fan of their spicy miso and now I cant go back to their regular house bowl.I love their ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_rich and fatty ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Price isn't cheap but it's reasonable. Living near littely tokyo, someone's always asking for recommendation for a good ramen shop. I always point them here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would say their soup is the best while Shinsengumi has the best ramen noodles. We need to combine the two somehow. Be prepared to wait though! If you want ramen. Try going before 6pm for dinner.",4
"I always see a long line whenever I pass by this place, so I decided to check it out. Ended up waiting for 1.5 hrs on a Thursday night, and the ramen was sub par. Not really sure why it's so popular, but I'm glad to have finally been able to try out their food. It's a small restaurant that's pretty vintage.Ordered the tuna roll &amp; house ramen. My bff got the spicy ramen, and we both agreed that our food was okay (not worth a long wait). I have to say that Shin Sen Gumi (down the street) tastes wayyy better. On a positive note, we did get our food extremely fast when we finally got our seats.",3
"There was a very long line the time that I went here. Honestly, the ramen was ok but nothing mind-blowing. I got the combo that included a side of pork tonkotsu, which was pretty good. The order was decent sized, but for the wait I didn't feel like it was worth it. It was around 100 degrees outside when I went, but the inside was even worse without any ventilation or AC. I was sweating profusely while eating my ramen. Overall it's not bad if you are craving ramen, but for the wait and the heat, I didn't feel like it was worth it.",3
"Came here on a school night with a friend and only had to wait 10 minutes. Score! Got the Daikoku ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I love the atmosphere here, but I'll be honest. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't understand why there is so much hype about this place. The ramen was good, but not amazing compared to other places in Little Tokyo, like Shinsengumi. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My recommendation, check the wait, if its more than 20 mins, just leave and go elsewhere. Cash only.",4
This place is way overrated. The broth was very average and the char siu meat pieces was very bland. It seems that the meat was boiled to cook with no other cooking preparation and then placed into the bowl. The takoyaki was average and the eel bowl was average. Very standard in a lot of different ramen places. I am glad I went on a weekday with no line wait. I would be super disappointed if I waited 1.5 hour for this.,3
"I visited Daikokuya with a few friends around mid day. Based off of what I had been told about this place I was so excited to finally try it out. I decided to try the spicy miso ramen and was far from disappointed. Our food came out fast, noodles were perfect, and chili oil made everything even better. My only issue was the wait. It's not the company's fault though. They are always busy and the place is pretty small so the wait is extensive. Just plan ahead before stopping for something quick.",5
"My favorite ramen spot, if you can handle the line. Super rich and tasty broth, definitley will come back again.",5
"Finally tried Daikokuya after hearing all the rave reviews from my friends--I'd been to nearly every other ramen joint on Sawtelle, so it was about time. I got the Daikoku Ramen as recommended by everyone, and it was damn delicious. The flavor was pretty deep and nuanced, and the broth wasn't watery at all. The portion was huge, though they did skimp a little on the meat (but made up for it with noodles and vegetables). I think I realized at this point that I prefer a stronger flavor to my ramen (like Tatsu)--so while I definitely appreciate how good Daikokuya's ramen was, I think I'm more about flavor that really hits you in the face. I'm no ramen connoisseur though, and all my friends insist that Daikokuya can't be beat, so I'll have to come back and try again some time!",4
I don't understand the hype. This place is grimey ( which I can deal with) and hot... ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_it feels like you are in a Japanese sweat lodge. The food was just ok. The best thing we had was the gyoza which was very good. The ramen and shredded pork bowl were not worth the wait and suffering in the sweltering heat.,3
The BEST RAMEN in town!!! I have been here a couple of times already and would never get tired of going back again and again. I would definitely commend it to every ramen lovers like myself out there!!! Keep up the good work,5
by far this is the best ramen place i've ever been to.. the chashu pork literally melts in your mouth! make sure to taste the broth first! it's so smooth!,5
"Wait was long, but my boyfriend and I were able to all around and explore all the little stores in the area so wasn't too bad. Food was great! Ordered the Daikokuya Ramen, pretty big portion and loved that I could drink the soup. Would recommend!",4
"The OG ramen place.I came around Sat night around 630 and there was 35 parties in front of me!! 35!! But it turned out just to be an hour wait, which isn't bad. Mostly because people tend to leave because the wait ends up being too long. There's always a wait, so come early to avoid the long, long lines. Salad - Shreeded cabagge with a onion tasting dressing on top. The dressing is addicting and it's a good light start to the meal. Takoyaki - Mixed reviews. Some loved it, some didn't enjoy it. yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_Daikoku Ramen (9.50) - Their famous ramen. The broth is rich. The noodles are a bit too tough for my liking. Their pork and soft boiled egg reigns supreme compared to all other ramen places. The pork is so fatty and melts in your mouth. Soft boiled egg is cooked perfectly. I have had incidents where they would overcook the eggs, but when it's done right, ITS DONE RIGHT. Ask for kotteri flavor for richer flavor because they use back fat. Definitely tastier. If you don't care for those extra calories, why not go big?yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_Fried Rice - THE BEST FRIED RICE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. The flavors are incredible. Fragrant, delicious, each bite is perfect. It's a bit on the oily side but who cares? IT'S SO DAMN GOOD.yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_NO TO-GO ORDERS. CASH ONLY.",4
"I finally got to try this place. The line is always super long. I came here once before and ended up leaving because i wasn't patient enough lol. Basically, you need to expect to wait at least 45 min or longer. The place itself is very small which is something I like actually since I'm more into small hole in the wall places. They also have a see through glass panel at the bar so that you can sit and eat while watching them make your ramen. I ordered the spicy ramen which came out pretty fast. Although it's called spicy ramen, it didn't have that much heat lol. It came with a few slices of pork also. Overall, pretty good ramen but not worth the long wait to be absolutely honest lol.",4
"I and my friend got her around 11pm they said they will close at 1am. But the line was already long that was wrapping around the entire of side walk. It was raining outside that night so we could not wait to get seat and get our food. You also have to understand the parking at LA, either you have to park far or keep turning around and look for your spot. Anyway, the restaurant is small but full house. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We got seat after 40 mins waiting (was fast because again the line was super long). We ordered the spicy miso ramen, takoyaki, and fried rice. Spicy miso ramen came with the biggest bowl ever. The noodle is great, tasty, chewy and make me feel like it was handmade right at the store. It was stand out for the ramen by itself versus many different ramen i tried before. However, the broth was tasted the same like many others place. In my opinion, it is nothing special about the broth but their meat, the porks, was melting inside my mouth with itself flavor. I love it. Next i tried the takoyaki, i dont like it, minus one star because the takoyaki was super cold inside, i dont know why. Maybe they have it out just ready by putting it to microwave instead on the grill. Last one, i have to say, you gotta try out their fried rice. It was moist, tasty, and had lot of meat. I love the fried rice. Even it was big bowl of ramen but I still can finish almost half of fried rice because it was so good. And yes i will come back here everytime i visit LA though. Maybe, late at night cuz i know for sure the line will even longer during the day.",4
Worth the wait. The broth is to die for! It is cash only though so make sure you bring enough.,5
"We waited 2 hours at 2pm on a Monday to eat at daikokuya. How ridiculous is that?! This place is super popular! We were really tempted to go a few doors down to Mr. Ramen but we stuck it out and we were glad that we did!! I ordered the spicy miso ramen (~$10) and it was quite delicious. I'm not a fan of ramen because I associate it with instant noodles and I actually describe it as a poor mans food. Why am I gonna pay $10+ for a bowl of ramen that I can get for 19 cents at the market?! Daikokuya gave me the answer to that question! Because it's delicious!!The ramen noodles are the kind of noodles that I like! They're thicker than the ramen that I think of when I hear the word ""ramen"". The soup was mildly spicy, which was good because I was still able to enjoy my meal. However, I think it could've been a little spicier (I love spicy food!). The pork was tender and creamy (?). The egg was between soft-boiled and hard boiled. On the table, there are jars of a minced garlic paste and sliced ginger. I added some garlic to my last few bites of ramen and it made it so much better!! So tasty!!Overall, come here well before you anticipate actually sitting down and eating. There's a long wait!! I would even suggest put your name down on the list and go walk around little tokyo!Cash only. Long wait. Yummy ramen. Nice staff. Good for small groups (you can sit at the bar--shorter wait time).",4
"This place maybe doesnt need my review... but whatever. I went recently after staying away for a long time due to expecting long lines and not good for large parties. However, I went a couple days ago and really enjoyed my meal. Their ramen is consistent and good over years! However, I got a pitcher of sapporo and takoyaki. I think their takoyaki is quite overpriced. It was OK.. and like almost $1 for each ball.. maybe even more. Also, I dont think the beer went so well with the ramen. Not their fault; bad choice on my part that I wanted to share.",4
Always going there with my girlfriend it's always an amazing experience What suggests big groups of people or just two people,5
"This is place made me fall in love with ramen! I first had it about 3-4 years ago and now ive been to almost over 15 different ramen shops and this place is still top 3! Food-The ramen is very flavorful and the meat is very tasty as well. The broth is jam packed with flavor. I do not usually finish the soup of most noodle soup dishes but i always try my hardest to finish the broth because it is so flavorful. I also go a rice bowl that was just as good as the ramenPrice- The price is about average for most ramen placesParking- Parking sucks here because its in little Tokyo which means you have to fight for parking spots or just use the structure but i always try to find parking on the streets because its cheaperService-The workers are very friendly and helpful when you ask questions about the menu and they give out excellent recommendations to new customersWait- Always expect to wait a long time! Every time i came here i have always had to wait over 30 minutes to almost 2 hoursRecommendation- Even with the bad parking and the super long wait, i still give it 5 stars which means it must be that good! I 100% RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! especially for people who do not like ramen ! This place has changed my girlfriends perception on ramen and now she loves it!",5
"Definitely not worth the two hour wait on a cold, winter Monday night. If it wasn't for the fact that we put our name down at 4:30pm for Daikokuya knowing there were still at least 40 parties ahead of us and then went next door to Marugame Monzo for some udon, we probably wouldn't have lasted the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The restaurant is tiny, just like in Tokyo, with five to six booths and then a counter where they only seat parties of two. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Even after we had some udon at Monzo next door and came back to Daikokuya, we waited another 15 minutes before we were seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Everyone in our party ordered the traditional Daikoku ramen bowl which comes with bean sprouts, chives, some meat and an egg. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is garlic and ginger at each table which you can add into your ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen was good but nothing spectacular that warranted a two hour wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I probably won't be back here again but at least I can say I've been, although I'm not quite sure what all the hype is about. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Parking is difficult to find in Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ended up finding metered parking near the Toy District further away. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All I can say is, if you do come, the strategy of eating at both Monzo and Daikokuya worked for us and we were able to try a little bit of everything, both udon and ramen.",3
"I would say hands down this is the best ramen spot in all of SoCal! The shop is small and usually packed, but it's most definitely worth the wait. I've been coming to Daikokuya my entire life. You can't go wrong ordering anything. Literally everything on the menu is delicious! Food comes out fairly quickly after ordering. The broth and chashu are heavily! The chashu is so nice, fatty, and tender! Major !Just a heads up, they do cash only, but they do have an ATM machine in the back of the restaurant.",5
"Finally tried the famous Daikokuya ramen last night and it was so good! Only downside is the long although we managed to walk around the Japanese village which is pretty neat! Btw, love the side salad dressing!!!!!Will be back for more!!!",4
"I'm a huge fan of their rich, pork base soup. Their noodles are slightly more thicker and chewier than other ramen houses. I always put garlic, extra ginger, sesame seeds to make the soup even more flavorful. I love their medium boiled seasoned egg that comes with the ramen, and their tender chashu (thick cut pork belly). Don't get me started with their fried rice. They probably fry their rice in pork belly fat, which makes it so extremely mouth watering. Salad is great!!!! The only downside of this place is the long hours of waiting (unless you beat the wait and come at an odd time), and cash only. I despise cash only policies!",5
"I had no expectations for Daikokuya given I never heard of it. Tsujika LA was a place I wanted to try but it was late and we were all hungry. The wait was about 30 min for 7 people and it was well worth it. The Takoyaki wasn't terrible but it wasn't that great either. One order has 5 balls. The sashimi bowl was good but since that came first, that filled us up fairly quickly. As for the ramen, the soup base was reminiscent of Ichiran in Japan. I chose the Daikokuya combination set with a salmon sashimi bowl. I chose Kittera which was fat that was added back in the soup to give it more depth in flavor. I also scooped about 4 spoonfuls of garlic purÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©e, which was the ingredient that gave it it's ""Ichiran"" flavor. The noodles weren't the best I had but the broth was damn good.",4
"I thought this place was just meh. Everyone and their mom that have been to this place said it is the best ramen. I was really excited to try it, but was kind of let down. Don't get me wrong, the broth had good flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly, but the broth was also really salty and my chashu was cold. It could possibly be that my expectations were through the roof, but I was dissatisfied with the ramen. Hours later, my mouth was dry and felt thirsty the rest of the night, even though I drank plenty of water. This definitely wasn't the worst of the Ramen I've had, but it didn't meet my expectations either. I will say though that the waiters were enthusiastic, and we received the ramen shortly after we ordered. BRING CASH.",3
"This place is amazing. Most of the ramen shops around it are half-empty and for good reason. They don't compare to the real deal. For once, it's also not just a place coasting on ""mystique"" generated by a wait time (check) and inadequate seating (check), which a lot of ""upscale brunch"" places try to do. I recommend getting a standard ramen bowl with extra pork, plus sashimi/sushi and dumplings on the side. The ""WTF, it's 2016"" refusal to accept credit cards is actually a baller move I admire. When you make ramen this good, you can get away with stuff like that.No drymouth afterwards, too, which means no MSG.#BestRameninLA",5
One of the best place for Ramen but the wait to be seated can be so damn long that it can be a turn off. I haven't been here for almost 4 years because of the wait. There are other Ramen place in Little Tokyo that are good as well minus the waiting line.,3
"I cannot say this is the best ramen I've ever had, but I would say it is a top 3. We went around 6PM and the wait was only about 15 minutes. I got their daikokuya ramen and eel bowl combo and the gyoza. The gyozas were good - nice and crispy. The flavors were there. The ramen soup itself was not very flavorful. The noodles were the perfect firmness, the egg was perfectly soft boiled, and the pork was delicious and tender! My absolute favorite was the eel bowl. I loved the marinade and it was just perfect!",4
"We loved everything from the fried rice, ramen, to the shredded pork. Very long wait but it was worth the experience. Honestly, it's not that difficult to get good Ramen in Los Angeles anymore.. Specially in locations like Torrance. But the sides that come with the combos made this meal extra special.",5
Best ramen ever. Is way better than any other ramen restaurant. 100% guaranteed food orgasm.,5
Best spicy miso ramen ever. !!! Love it and always have it when I go there. Customer service is great. Keep it up guys.,5
I knew this place was hype from when I first heard of it at OC Japan Fair. It was a hecka long wait but it was worth it. I got the spicy ramen and for good measure I threw in some chili oil and chili flakes. Very satisfying.,5
"Daikokuya is the quintessential ramen joint in Los Angeles and being the first truly delicious ramen place I've been to, the ramen to which I compare other ramen. I am not a big fan of pork but there are certain restaurants where I can't get enough of it. Daikukuya is one of those places. Initially, plan to be in line from 15 mins to an hour depending on the time you go. Daikokuya is no stranger to long lines. Also, take into consideration that this restaraunt is cash only. Now, about the soup itself. The delicious tonkatsu broth is so flavorful and fatty, yet doesn't make you feel greasy or overly full. The chashu pork is cooked to perfection and practically melts in your mouth. The noodles are creamy, and like the pork, deliciously melt in your mouth. You can get a half bowl, full bowl, or a ramen bowl and side combo. I usually go with the half bowl if I'm not particularly hungry, or the giant full bowl if I am. All the bowls come with a perfectly soft boiled egg. The runny yolk mixed with the creamy noodles and flavorful broth is the most heavenly combination of tastes created in the human mouth. There is a spicy ramen which I often like to eat, but it may be spicy for some. I reccoment trying the Daikoku ""regular"" ramen the first time going here, then getting spicy if interested. Mix in a little garlic and some ginger and you're good to go!",5
"Totally worth the long wait. Butter soft pork, melt in your mouth sashimi, divine Ramen broth. 10 out of 10.",5
"I bow down to you, Daikokuya. Your ramen is top reign.You're no hype, you're no joke.You've got everyone else beat.You form lines, even before it even opens.Space is limited and line snakes around.You keep it simple, just how we like it.Soup or no soup; hot or cold; no spicy or spicy.Heck, you can even adjust noodle firmness for us.Your broth is ridiculously rich.So is your fatty chashu. Oh, no, we can't forget about your delicious flavored egg!Toppings, toppings, toppings.Dem noodles though, could make any frown turn upside up.Together, the bowl is of harmony.For an affordable price, I could eat this everyday.I hate you.I love you.How can I ever eat ramen the same way?",5
"After having tried so many different ramen places all in a row, either my palette has become very sophisticated and can distinguish between the myriad types of ramen or I've simply become picky.I've heard about Daikokuya for some time now and even co-workers from the Bay Area would recommend it. But after recently trying it, while it was good, it wasn't all out amazing. Does that make me sound spoiled? It was good and in the spectrum of everything that I've had recently, it's probably somewhere in the middle. Worth a 30 minute wait? Questionable. I think I'd still rather wait 2 hours for Orenchi.But I did see in many Yelp reviews that the gyoza were recommended. So my co-worker and I split an order and they were delicious! They were cooked, similar to Taiwainese style potstickers - long, and cooked on a griddle with flour, so they would stick together and have an extra crisp. A must order!It's it wrong for me to say that I'd only go back for the gyoza?!?!",3
"Daikokuya has got to be the most authentic ramen joint in Los Angeles. Yes, you will have to wait a while to enjoy your meal but it is definitely worth it! The waiters are quick in placing your order and serving your food. I would recommend their famous Daikokuya ramen and a side cabbage salad. They're pretty popular for their salad dressing, which they sell in bottles for about $16.00. I find that their ramen broth is not as thick and heavy as other places. It is a well balanced portioned, although if you are REALLY hungry opt for the medium bowl. The half bowl was sufficient for my needs.All in all you get the most bang for your buck and get to go home with a warm, full tummy!",4
"Great place to eat ramen, highly recommend! Our first time in Los Angeles and had to try due to all the reviews! 7000 reviews!",5
"I am not a ramen person, but this place made me change my mind. My boyfriend and I got the spicy miso and it was mouth watering good. We were fighting over the last sip and bite of our gyoza we ordered. Definitely would go here next time I am in LA. Thank you guys so much!",5
"Small little joint with not a lot of seating. There was a bar right in front of the kitchen to sit at and maybe no more than 10 tables. There is a line and will be a line! Food came out very fast. I ordered the spicy ramen which was not very spicy, i added more chili oil in to it. There was less broth than i would have liked and the noodles were softer than i usually like to eat them. It was pretty heavy and a lot of msg because i was so thirsty! Flavor wasn't bad but it wasn't the best iv'e had. Glad i got to try this place out though.",3
"Food: 5 starsCustomer service: 5 starsThis place is amazing. Even though you'll wait for an hour or more during rainy or shot summer days, it's worth it. The broth is very flavorful. Try the kotteri flavor for much more intense fatty flavor, you won't regret it. Also, ask for the hot oil if you're a fan of spicy. It's not too spicy but it add a great flavor spike. The customer service is also awesome. I've been coming here for more than 5 years and I've never had bad service. All employees are very friendly and always with a smile. Thank you Daikokuya!",5
"We both got the Daikokuya Ramen (tonkotsu) which came standard with cha shu pork, whole egg, bamboo shoots, sprouts, and green onion. He added the Kotteri (added richness - from back fat- to the broth) and nori (dry seaweed) and left out the sprouts. She added wakame (fresh seaweed).Her broth was great! When it came out it didn't look super impressive. But the broth was rich and creamy, had the perfect amount of salt, and a tad sweet. It wasn't so fatty that her mouth felt slick - really just the perfect balance. His broth was rich and flavorful but not as creamy as you'd expect from such fatty ingredients. Other people's bowls looked steaming hot, but his could have been a few degrees hotter.The egg was cooked well - yolk was not runny, not dry. It really was just right. Like the best shops, they marinate theirs, and they took their time. Take a bite and you'll see that the marinade soaked in all the way up to the yolk. One of the best eggs we've had...ever. The noodles were thin to medium, cooked to a chewy al dente. They didn't skimp on the noodles either, but not so much that it throws the bowl's balance off. They use Berkshire pork for their cha shu. It looked like it might be dry but it was very tender, though sliced a bit too thin causing the pieces to fall apart too easily (handle with care!). Average portion size. Not the best pork we've had, but we were happy. We were one of the first to be seated when they opened at 11am on a Thursday. People began to pile in by 11:30am with a short wait. Get there by 11:20am and it seems you should be ok, with no wait, at least on the weekdays.Out of 3, 2 YUMS.",4
"I was never really a fan of tonkotsu or chasu until I waited outside for an hour at Daikokuya to finally get some seats at the bar. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Then I realized, the reason why I do not like tonkotsu is because the places in Dallas suck. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Granted, I still prefer fish or vegetable based broths, but when that huge bowl of kotteri ramen came out, I knew that this is why people in TX are angry and always creating havoc in their reviews.I stupidly asked for extra soup at $2.50 because I usually finish the broth first and have leftover noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Well, the extra soup came out in what to me looked like a regular sized bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Then the actual ramen arrived in a bowl larger than my head, and trust me, I have a huge head. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I noticed some chasu floating around and the top of a whole egg peeking through the broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There were plenty of noodles hiding underneath and if the bowl were scaled down a bit, the noodle:soup ratio would have been perfect.The chasu practically fell apart when I tried to pick it up. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was so soft, even the fat was incredibly soft and not rubbery like others I've had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I tasted the broth and knew my body was slowly dying from poor health while my taste buds were being washed over with a soup that they were not worthy of. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was all so flavorful on a level I felt I couldn't completely appreciate. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I felt ashamed that I could not eat it all. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had ordered the combo with an ikura bowl which I ate first and was completely delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I can't find just a simple ikura bowl where I'm at and I hardly order gyoza because it's always the frozen stuff served like ones from Costco. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Well, their gyoza was nothing like that at all. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It actually tasted real.I'm probably reiterating what the other 5000 reviews have said so I'll leave it at that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you're ever in Little Tokyo, I do recommend sucking it up and waiting in line to try this place.",5
"I lucked out and only waited 20 minutes to get a seat. How'd that happen?!Anyways, I like the al dente noodles, staff were friendly and informative, &amp; portions were really large!Got the Spicy Miso Ramen (though it wasn't spicy at all) and the Diakoku ramen (kotteri flavor so it's richer). Both broths had good flavor even if the spicy wasn't spicy. They weren't overly salty either which is nice as a lot are I feel.",4
"Absolutely delicious, my bf and I come as often as possible. Yes, there is always a line but it is so worth it.",5
"Bad smelling pork in my ramen! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I nearly puked all over the table. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Middle of the day &amp; no I wasn't hungover. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles ARE NOT fresh, we all know that and they're not the best. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have been coming here for years but my last visit will be MY LAST VISIT. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I used to LOVE you guys, but I'm not happy and I definitely didn't feel good after I left &amp; had a stomach ache. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Really was not ever expecting to make a review that was negative about Daikokuya.",1
Ramen poses several challenges for bears. We can't use chopsticks well and start to get a bit fussy when we have to wait a long time for our food. However this place is definitely worth the wait plus having to bribe a human friend to help feed me! Noodles were perfectly chewy and the pork broth was rich but not too heavy. I would definitely recommend the traditional ramen and the gyoza. 2 paws up!,5
We came here twice during our three day stay in Little Tokyo. Great for small groups and ramen lovers. I'm more of a spicy miso type of gal but you do you. The original flavor is p good too. The combination deal is a crazy amount of food. The ramen is already a generous amount. Good price for what you get and how much you get!!,4
"Daikokuya gets 4.5 from me. While many consider this to be the best ramen in Los Angeles, I don't think this place cracks my top 3, though it is close. The good: The ramen here is delicious. One of the best in Los Angeles, no doubt. They have some sushi, as well, which is a major plus. Cheap beer is readily available, and the service once seated is great.The bad: Located in Little Tokyo, this place is kind of a hole-in-the-wall: quite small, and easy to miss. Parking down here can be annoying sometimes, and it's going to come with a price. The wait for this restaurant is usually quite long and can take upwards of an hour plus. Get here early if you plan on coming for a work weekday lunch.Definitely give this place a try if you haven't yet.",5
My go to in the city for ramen. Never fails. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Delicious. Hit here then go to the moca museum! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork and noodles are the best!,5
"This restaurant is definitely a hole in the wall type place but I love it. I came in with my boyfriend around 11 on a Thursday night. It was about an hour before they closed but it was still packed. We put our name down on the list and waited maybe 10-15 minutes. I wish I had the name of our server but he was a super upbeat guy who was happy to bring us to our table and take our order. I was sooo happy to see that they had a half order of their daikoku ramen because I wasn't too hungry but was craving ramen badly. It was also really convenient of them to have a section of the menu with ramen/rice combinations since my boyfriend has a huge fatty appetite. I ordered the half order of daikoku ramen and he ordered their spicy miso combo with chicken teriyaki and a California roll. The half order of ramen was perfect for my appetite and I was so happy that the broth was milky and rich. I was smiling so big when our server brought it out because it came in such a cute mini bowl! I had a good amount of noodles and half of an egg. I had one slice of pork and it did not have lots of fat on it like most other ramen places, which was good because I hate when the pork slices are like that. My boyfriend basically destroyed his whole meal aside from me taking a few bites of the yummy teriyaki. Overall, it was a great meal for a decent price and I'm glad we were served so happily even when we had come only an hour before closing.",5
"This is pretty much the best deal you can for ramen. BUT, you also have to be willing to wait for it. We got there around 8-9 on a Monday night in June, and we still had to wait around an hour for a group of 5.If you want the most bang for your buck, definitely get one of the combinations! We got pork cutlet, chicken/egg. The combinations seemed the most worth it for the price and they were all delicious. You get the daikoku ramen, small salad, and a bowl of rice topped with the meat that you chose for the combo.Let me just say that this is the BIGGEST bowl of ramen you will ever get. AND I'm saying that for the regular size. You can ask for a giant/supersize as well. I couldn't finish my bowl - only ate half. Even my boyfriend barely finished the bowl of ramen and none of us could eat our extra rice bowl.The Daikoku ramen was pretty good in terms of flavor - not as good as say Totto ramen in NY (I think I like their broth best so far), but it was still pretty good. Their greatest selling point for us was the insane amounts of food for only $14-$15. My friends and I still constantly dream about the gigantic bowl of ramen from this place every time we eat an east-coast medium size bowl of ramen for $10-12.",4
"Waiting sucks, and so does parking, but that is the nature of the beast. The broth is excellent, the service is fast, the pork is perfectly cooked and everything is great. They are very heavy handed with the green onions, but I kinda like that. This is one of the best Ramen places in CA I think. If the wait is too long, go around the corner to Shin-Sen-Gumi, it is just as good as this place and has more options if you are picky. I do think monta ramen in las vegas is better... their broth is richer and creamier, even than the fatty option here. something for you guys to check out if you are out that way.",4
"With over 6,000 reviews, Daikokuya should have been a lot better than I expected. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, I left feeling unimpressed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the regular daikoku ramen combo with eel rice bowl ($17.95). The side of cabbage came out first. The dressing is different...but I couldn't decide what made it stand out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It almost had a powdery texture and not as sweet as typical thousand island dressing. The eel bowl was served next. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You get three half pieces over a bowl of rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The teriyaki sauce was way too sweet. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't recommend getting eel here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Finally, the ramen came last. I was surprised at how large the bowl was - it's probably more than twice the size of the half order bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It comes with scallions, bean sprouts, some bamboo, some chashu pork, and a soft boiled egg. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I hated the pork because it fell apart and tasted like nothing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles and broth were ok. They claim to have a secret soy sauce recipe for their broth. I think I still prefer Santouka. Service was good. As expected from a Japanese restaurant, they announce greetings when customers enter and when they leave. The waitresses are very attentive to the wait list. Three things that won't bring me back here: 1) CASH ONLY. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Need I say more? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The gift shop next door got smart and will offer free cash back..with a purchase of course - as opposed to ATM withdrawal fee. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is no BoA around, but there's Chase and Citi Bank. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_2) The wait time. It's so popular even during lunch. Expect to wait twenty to thirty minutes on a weekday for two people and you might not even get a table - they have bar seating also. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_3) Parking. Yes, I complain about LA parking all the time. Find some metered street spots around 1st or 2nd St. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There are also parking garages or lots around the Little Tokyo Village. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Furthermore, Daikokuya does not validate parking tickets. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Boo",3
"I'm not sure what the hype is all about. My friends and I came here because of the good reviews but we weren't in love with the ramen. To me, it was just okay - nothing too special but not terrible. The only thing terrible was the 1.5hr long wait. We expected this wait, but what upset us was the fact that when we checked our name on the list, the hostess wrote down that she called our name and just crossed it off the list. We were pretty hangry and we knew for a fact that she didn't call our name since we were waiting inside and when we told her, she just brushed it off and denied it. Overall I don't think it's worth the wait and the restaurant is cash only.",3
Best ramen ever! The wait times are horrendous but so so so so worth it! It's the only place I come with the expectation of waiting over an hour and I'm totally okay with it. My recommendation is to go before it opens at 11:00 and just wait and hope that you're the first round of customers. This restaurant is in a super cute part of town right behind little Tokyo so after ramen make sure to walk across the street to the village for some shopping and Mochi ice cream. This restaurant is definitely a must try!,5
"Really small place. We came at 5pm on a Thursday so there was no wait.Really friendly wait staff.Unfortunately the Ramen was just not that good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was the first time I had to use soy sauce in my Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My husband's was over cooked and mine was undercooked. Not consistent at all.The chicken rice bowl with eggs was mostly onions. The pork was soft but flavorless.Husband got the normal tonkatsu broth and I got the spicy miso. Both were so bland. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The miso had a strong smell to it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ikura don was ok. Best past of the meal was the complimentary slaw. It was so good! With 2 beers, our total bill was $55Pass on this ramen next time we're in LA.",2
"I love the ramen at Daikokuya. Been a fan for a long time now. The wait is long... Typically about an hour. But it's worth it. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny.. Cozy if you will. It's a simple menu, no frills. I usually get the regular ramen, or with kotteri broth, or the shredded pork bowl. The ramen noodles are springy and chewy, never overcooked. The broth is savory and thick--totally makes the bowl! A plus because you can add all the ginger you want as it's self serve on the table.Yes, parking sucks. I usually aim to find metered parking on the surrounding streets.",5
"I had to give the place 4 stars because:1. Long long waits2. Small venue3. Smaller tablesI've been to this place a couple of times, and yes this place is delicious. But if you are planning on eating here, be warned, expect to wait at least an hour of your lucky. My last visit, we waited for 2.5 hours. Like I said, yes this place is delicious, but not 2.5 hours of waiting worth, but if you're patient, go for it. Their are plenty of ramen places in the area that are as good, including the ones on the same street. I only waited 2.5 hours my last visit because I was with a group of friends who are just die hard fans of this place. I usually order the combo with the spicy ramen and shredded pork bowl. Ramen is good, but sometimes I felt like there was a bit tooo oily. But still good! Once you pass the 1+ wait, ordering is pretty easy and quick. You literally get your food within 10-15 minutes after ordering. This place is the only place I've tried a shredded pork bowl, and even their salad is good with their dressing, which they also sell BTW. All in all, their ramen is good. I wouldn't go as far as saying its my favorite place. If you can get passed the long wait, the small venue, and the small tables, this place is worth the wait I suppose. And its only cash only for all you plastic people.",4
"After about an hour wait for a party of 5, we were seated. The menu is fairly simple. If you want ramen, you either get daikoku ramen or the spicy daikoku ramen. I got the daikoku ramen with the pork cutlet bowl.The ramen was very generously portioned (totally didn't need the extra pork cutlet bowl). The broth was very heavy in flavor (way too savory for my taste). The noodles, pork belly, and egg was tasty. However, if you ask me to wait an hour again to eat here, I must say the food isn't worth the hype. I've had better ramen in NYC.",3
"This place is bomb. Fast efficient service just like the shops in Tokyo and Kyoto. I was gonna take pics but I immediately forgot once the food was sat down in front of me. I recommend the gyoza and their signature ramen bowl. Opt for the ramen combo if you're truly hungry, ramen bowl plus a small bowl of rice with your choice of meat. Also comes with a small classic shredded cabbage salad!",5
We are staying in Double Tree Hilton and this place is like 5mins walk. When we arrived they have a very long wait and we are so glad coz the wait for me shows how good the place is. This place remind me so much of Monta Ramen in Las Vegas where we first Fall in Love the first time we tried Japanese Ramen. We got Daikokuya Ramen it has full of flavor. Pork melt in your mouth so heavenly. It was beyond delicious. Will be coming back here every time we are in town.,4
This has to be by far my favorite ramen spot in LA. The long wait is definitely worth the wait!!!,5
Oh my gosh. Delicious ramen. Open late. The only bad thing is cash only. Otherwise go and your ramen on.,4
"3.5Crazy line even before this place opens on a Sunday afternoon. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When they open the door, the slew of people rush in and sit down. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And of course, tables are full once they reach my party! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's okay, put your name down and we only waited about 15-20 mins. This place was quite efficient and people already knew what they wanted. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_No one took forever reading the menu and choosing what they want. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The cooks were on it, bowl after bowl of ramen came out without hesitation. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We decided to get the Tsukemen, cold ramen with a warm bowl of rich soup. Ramen was a little more than al dente... A little too hard. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If the bowl of soup was warmer, it would've been great. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Comes with 2 slices of grilled pork belly which tasted awesome. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I really didn't kno what to do with half the plateful of chopped green onions... In the soup it goes...Definitely not the best Tsukemen I've had, but still good.Quick service, fast order, eat, go place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you wana chit chat, go somewhere for coffee afterwards.",4
"I've been here 3 times so far; the first, at close to closing time on a weekday (won't do that again, had to wait in a line for about 30 minutes) and twice right at opening hour (best time if you ask me).I order Daikokuya ramen koterri style with chili oil every time and it's always good. The egg is my favorite part, but I love that the soup is so rich without it being too salty. With that much fat in the broth, you don't need that much salt. I've seen other people order the combo that includes other stuff but I don't see how anyone can have that much room in their tummies after all this richness.Anyway, I love the food, the ambiance (hole in the wall, right out of a place in Tokyo, J-pop music and soap operas on the TV), the service (they attend to you right away and they're quick quick quick to get you in and out of there) and the price ($9.50 for ramen in L.A.? Hells yeah).Pros: The noodles are thick and wavy. Everything is yummy. Going early is good for the soul. Cons: Parking is a snarly $$$ bitch. Especially if you do so at the Tokyo Mall. I figure this is why the food is so cheap; because parking isn't.",5
"I'm guna start off with, I am not a ramen snob. lolTried this place last time I was in the area and have been dying to go back! Compared to what I've tried in the Bay Area this was bomb and probably really ""woohoo as good as it gets"", but I know I haven't tried all of the ""best of the best"". I will say it's the best I have tried so far! The broth spice hit the spot, the california rolls (i'm so basic) hit the spot, and even the rice my bf added to his ramen hit the spot.Definitely worth the try if you're in the area and aren't too much of picky ass ramen eater. ;)",4
"Best bowls and ramen in SoCal. Great tempura and miso. Love this place! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Cash only and long lines but worth the wait!The ramen and bowl combo is the best of both worlds, pork cutlet bowl for the win. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Mmmmmmmmmm great!",5
"I eat here all the time and recommend it to all of my friends. Every time I eat here, I break my vegetarian vows to chow down on their broth. Hella long wait. But by glob is it worth it. If you're not down to chill 'n talk to your homies while you wait for the dankest ramen, then why are you out w/ them in the first place?",5
"Maybe it was too hot but it seems the wait was not worth the heat. First it was simply more than avg heat was inside the restaurant. Eating soup at a hot establishment is not my recommendation. The food itself was not bad at all, the spicy miso ramen my girl got she enjoyed and the Tsukaimen I ordered was too salty on the soup side.",3
"This place was very small. Only about 7 tables and a small bar. I waited about an hour before I was seated. They skipped our name which ticked me off because I was starving! I asked about it and they said they were trying to seat people with a smaller party. 5 minutes later, they seated us. I ordered the spicy miso ramen. The soul base and noodles were just okay in my opinion, nothing different nor spicy. The cha siu was very tender and juicy though!! My favorite part of the mean was the egg. Half boiled egg was cooked perfectly. Customer service was alright. I understand that they were extremely busy. The food came out within 5 minutes we ordered though, so I was pretty happy about that. Overall, this place is overhyped and I was expecting more.",3
"Came here for lunch at noon. Didn't get called until 2pm. I guess if you want to eat here for lunch, you should probably get here at 10:00am. There is a sign-in sheet as you enter the door. We arrive and they have already started on page 2. You can't really gauge how busy it is by simply looking at the line outside because there is a trendy udon noodle place next door called Monzo. The people who wait in the front are a blend of customers from the two businesses. One of the reasons why the wait was so long was because we brought the baby with us. There is a long bar with 10-12 chairs and maybe 6 tables. Our requirement for a high chair meant that we could only sit at a table and not the bar. People with parties of 1-2 were seated within 45-50 minutes. I ordered the signature Diakokuya ramen, a beef bowl and an order of Takoyaki. The Takoyaki is okay; I don't mean that it is not worth ordering, but I'm just not a fan of uncooked batter. I usually don't order it, but if you've stood in line for 2 hours, you want to maximize your experience at this place. The beef bowl was quite tasty, just a couple notches up from a Yoshinoya beef bowl with a smaller portion. BTW if you ever have a chance to eat at a Yoshinoya in Asia, do try it. It will blow your mind away... To the ramen, it looked pretty neutral as it arrived at the table however, this is the BEST ramen I've had. The broth was thick and creamy with a smokey pork and garlic flavor. There were bamboo shoots, a soft boiled egg, green onions and soft and silky pork floating in and among the perfectly cooked ramen noodles. Delicious is the only word that comes to mind. I sat there thinking about how I've screwed up my life because, I don't know how to cook anything this good. They are definitely good at what they do, making ramen and keeping people waiting. There's nothing spectacular with the decor, however if you look around inside, and quickly glance outside you do feel like you're in a different country... Maybe that's just me and my infatuation with all things Japan. You will be rewarded if you are willing to wait it out. BTW, they say it's okay to slurp your noodles in Asia as a way of conveying to the cook/chef you are enjoying your noodles. To test my theory, I kept slurping my noodles and looked up at the chef, he didn't even notice! I'd take another bite with a loud slurp and almost choked; looked up, and the chef didn't skip a beat, making more bowls of ramen and not noticing my attempt to complement him. I take one final loud slurp, look up....nothing. After a while, I'm a bit irritated so I put on my glasses and notice he was a Mexican dude. Did that really happen? Maybe... :)",5
"There's always a queue whenever I pass by this store but it's worth it. We went here last Monday to get our ramen fix and waited for around 30 minutes to get our seats. The food was great, we ordered the signature ramen, miso ramen, combo, and the veggie tofu and all made our tummy very happy. I could give them 5 stars, but the place is not very clean.",4
"Best ramen and soup. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Worth the wait before being seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The amount of ramen could feed two people. Craving for the salad dressing, yum yum. Definitely will go back soon!!!",5
"Really really good, comforting, authentic ramen. Noodles were cooked perfectly. Next time I want to try the spicy miso based ramen or the tsukemen ramen because the standard broth didn't have the intensity of flavor that I personally prefer. However, being a white Italian American and not a man of Japanese decent, I may be completely out of my element. However, I've been to Japan twice, which certifies me to pretend to be an expert on eastern cuisine, and I shall reserve the right to judge the aforementioned hemisphere. Where was I... The takoyaki (delicious chewy octopus balls of love) were excellent, giving you sweet, smoky and savory, all in moan-inducing bites.Price was just under $10 for a very nice portion of ramen. The wait was about 30+ minutes.",4
"Literally the best ramen I've ever had. Get the daikoku ramen with kotteri; it's fattier, and therefore much more rich and delicious. You can alter the firmness of the noodles, which is good because I like really firm noodles. The pork belly is well-seared and doesn't get soggy!Cons: service slight inattentive because it's always busy, LONG wait, cash only.But I always dream of Daikokuya. So sad I don't live in LA.",5
"The wait and being harassed by homeless people was definitely worth it. The ramen itself was decent in taste, however the chashu pork was a little overdone for me. Nonetheless, very tasty. The real winner was the shredded pork bowl. Every bite had so much flavor that I never wanted it to end. The yakisoba plate was pretty sweet and savory. The tempura bowl was pretty massive for the price you're paying for it.Lastly, the salad dressing is what blew my mind. It had a very strong onion taste which then is softened by a very light sweetness. I could not stop eating the salad and wanted to just bathe in the dressing. You can apparently buy the dressing and get your bottle refilled as well. Ughh, I probably will buy a cooler and come back for it next time. The taste is going to forever haunt me.",4
"Came here Sunday for lunch - arrived around 11:45AM and there was already a long wait! I expected to wait a bit, but I didn't think it'd be so busy that early. My sister put her name down on the waiting list and was told it'd be about an hour. They don't take your number or anything and if you miss your name..they'll skip you...so keep track of time! You put your name down next to a number, so at least that'll give you an idea of about how many ppl are ahead of you. So, my sister and I went shopping around Little Tokyo while we waited...this made the time go by a lot quicker! We came back around 45 mins later and there were still about 15 people ahead of us o_0. It seemed to be going by quick though. Overall I think we waited around 1.5 hours.The menu has a bit of a variety with ramen, sushi, and rice bowls. They also offer combinations, which we thought was a great deal! So, my sister and I decided to share a combination which included spicy miso ramen, shredded pork bowl, and a side salad for $13.95. The portion size was huge hence why we decided to share our meal! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Now, I didn't go here with extremely high expectations. I just saw on Yelp that they had good reviews and our hotel was nearby, so we decided to check it out! The ramen was definitely great, but the spicy miso broth wasn't as spicy as I'd hope...even with adding the chili oil. I liked that the ramen came with a bunch of toppings already included - a lot of spots in DC charge so much for additions. Overall, the ramen was tasty and cooked right..the chasu had really good flavors to it. But it wasn't anything like, ""omgg this is the best ramen ever""BUT the shredded pork bowl was ahhh-mazing. TONS of flavor - sweet yet savory and great texture. There were bits in there that were extra crispy and it was just perfection. Good food, good service, and great value!",4
"Came here last night on a whim. The boyf and I hadn't been to Little Tokyo in quite some time and I was excited to try this restaurant because of the rave reviews it has on Yelp. First, similar to other reviews the wait is long, but don't let it deceive you. I put my name down thinking that the wait would have been 45 mins. After 15 mins my name was called because other discouraged parties left. Don't feel defeated because to my surprise it moves rather quickly. I enjoyed the items that I ordered and would suggest this to my fellow Yelpers. I loved the spicy ramen soup. It originally comes with pork but I requested that the pork be removed but the broth is still pork based. I don't really mind but wanted to mention that option. Ordered the Tuna sashimi and it was 8 big pieces which were really fresh.The boyf ordered the Teriyaki Chicken bowl and was pleased with the portions and it came with a side salad that had shredded lettuce w/the homemade peanut dressing and a big bowl of miso soup. We had bar seating and I enjoyed that rustic feel of old Japan. Will come back again.",4
"My buddy and I headed there on a Saturday Night and there was a huge line waiting outside for sometime, however since it was just the two of us, we got seats in 10 minutes at the sushi bar. Even though I was planning to have the Ramen, I ended up ordering the Bento Box with Tempura Shrimps, Pork Cutlet and the California Rolls sushi. The portions are huge and they only accept cash. It was the first time I tried Sushi in the US, and oh I was impressed. I'm coming back again for the Ramen.",5
"It was just my luck that on my first visit here the party before us on the list was a party of 9. So I'll spare you the part about how waiting to be seated here absolutely sucks...Once we were seated it didn't take long to order because we knew exactly what we wanted: Kotteri Daikoku Ramen and fried rice combo. We figured that this is one of those places that you visit once, so why not go big (and by big I mean ""let's order the fattiest thing possible and make no apologies about it"").If you ignore the fact that the ramen was soaked in bacon fat and came with generous portions of buttery pork belly, it was a solid meal. The broth was extremely thick, rich and creamy. The noodles struck the right balance between firm and chewy. The fried rice was average but much better once we spiced it up with some Sriracha.The service here is prompt to the point where I felt like every time I looked up my water was being refilled which was great.If you're familiar with the Little Tokyo area you already know that parking is a joke but at night time it can be a little easier to find a spot on the street. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But before you park make sure that you have cash as Daikokuya is CASH ONLY.If you're looking for really good ramen, this is it, there are other options but those options aren't more satisfying than this one.",4
Inhaled the ramen. Worth the 45 minutes wait. They should change the booths to chair/tables to seat more people and decrease the wait time. Best Ramen in the US!,5
"The first time I came here I left unimpressed. I got the kotteri and everything but I thought the side of fried rice was better than the ramen... However, I went back and ordered the same thing and was floored. So, so, so good. I'm not sure what changed between the first time and every other time since but this place is very good. The broth is thick and lovely, the meat is tender and melts in your mouth and the noodles are served slightly al dente and everything works together in a magical, flavorful harmony.Their fried rice is also amazing and definitely worth it if you can handle the carbs. My only complaint, and this is a pretty big one because I eat ramen so often, is this place is cash only. I'd go there much more than once a month if they took my credit card.",5
"I was pleasantly surprised about this place. Everyone keeps talking about it and I'm always in lala land like whatever, there's decent ramen in the bay, and it sounds like hype.Queue up to a weekend (well my weekend at least) trip I was taking and my friend wanted to try this place as it was on her bookmarks for quite a while, so I gave in, and added it to our itinerary after eggslut at grand central market. We found street parking and grossly overpaid for parking, and walked towards the restaurant. It was Veterans Day (Wednesday) and we got there around 1115 and surprised there was already a decent size list of people waiting and we said, well we paid for parking, might as well wait.There was a family waiting and they were asking each other what they were gonna get, and the dad said he wanted the original and is considering adding the kotteri to make it more rich and his kid said "" Daddy, I don't want you to die!"" Ahhh these kids haha Come at most 20 minutes we were called and seated at the bar. We glanced over the menu and we decided to order the original Daikokuya ramen along with takoyaki and gyoza and we were baffled as how you eat the gyoza.Takoyaki arrived first and we tried it. It was delicious, crispy on the outside with plenty of bonito flakes and gooey center along with octopus inside.Then our ramen arrived, and first thing always is to try the broth, and it was rich, not too salty and overall enjoyable. This is already really rich, I wonder much crazier it gets if you add the kotteri...Anyways the noodles were good, not too over done and the bowl of ramen was quit delicious. I want to say it taste better than the ramen I've been accustomed to in the Bay Area, but I went to Japan, and that blows this out of the water. Still good though. Finally comes the gyoza, and we were still baffled in how to eat it, so I just stuck my chopstick in it where it looks like there was a line and out came a pot sticker that tasted wonderful. The filling was on point along with the crispiness of the pan fried skin on the top.We left the restaurant stuffed and had to circle a block around little Tokyo before we got back into the car.It's cash only, and you might probably have to wait a bit, but it's good.Cheers!",4
"Oh yea the ramen sweats are real! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Oh wait..maybe it's cause this joint is just hot as hell even before you start to dig into a delicious bowl of ramen! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_No worries, pitcher of kirin please!You want something rich and hearty, the Daikoku ramen will do you good.You in the mood for something spicy, with a broth that's lighter than their tonkotsu? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Spicy Miso Ramen is a winner!The wait can be long if you're looking to get a table so prepare yourself for that. We were a group of 3 on a Wednesday afternoon and waited about 45 mins. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Worth it though!",5
"First let me preface this by saying I'm from Toronto. I have no idea what the ramen scene is like here, so I can only compare this to Toronto. And unfortunately, this is one of those rare occasions where I'm disappointed (although somewhat glad) to say that Toronto does it better. Yes the noodles are good, they have a superb bounce, giving it a firm, satisfying bite. The char su is amazing. Melt in your mouth, filled with delicious pork flavour. These were the two things that impressed me. After this, while the broth is flavourful, it is hardly as rich as some of the broths up in Toronto, it's a little bit too watery so it does not cling to the noodles well, leaving the noodles with a bland taste. You get around this by drinking some with each bite of noodle, but it's not the same. The other disappointment was the egg, unfortunately I usually expect a gooey, semi liquid yolk with my ramen eggs, this was was just a little shy of hard boiled where the yolk started to get opaque. Overall this is a good ramen shop, Toronto does it better. I personally would not wait over 15mins for this again.",4
"HMMM................... I'm thinking this is like 4.25-4.5....? haha. Like if there was a long wait like there usually is, you would think it's gotta be a solid 5 lol. But it's not quite for me.Actually I didn't have to wait for dinner with my bf, because there was an opening at the bar. It was probably the reason why we were down to eat here, cos otherwise we both would prefer Shin Sen Gumi (our #1 lol). BUT why not right? Take that no-wait opportunity cos otherwise it may never happen again lol.I actually have tried Daikokuya at the Arcadia location, but it seems everyone is saying that that location is not the same as this one, not as good, not as bla bla bla bla so I thought I should give this place a try too. Tbh, the ramen at the Arcadia location wasn't bad, it was just not that special. I like ordering the shredded pork bowl there over the ramen.But here I thought I should give the ramen another try. So I ordered the spicy miso ramen (that's somewhat of a newer item I think... right?) combo with the shredded pork bowl. Bf ordered the daikokuya ramen combo with a katsudon. I also asked for a chili oil in case my ramen wasn't spicy enough.SOOOO? I thought it was really yummy actually. Like, not better than Shin Sen Gumi, but ALMOST as good as Silverlake (like really close), better or equal to Yukinoya, and a little better than Manichi, in a different way. Haha that will only make sense if you have eaten at those places.The ramen noodles were nice and curly, had a good chew to it. Not too hard or soft. The broth was creamy and delicious, but only a little bit spicy so I did add a bit of chili oil, which added a little more kick but it won't get to that level of spicy like Silverlake's ramen (or Yukinoya).The chashu! Definitely melts in your mouth and it kinda falls apart real easily, which is a good sign. Super tender. The egg was also perfectly cooked with that smooth creamy yolk. I don't like bean sprouts but I forgot to ask for without... rookie mistake. They also give you some bamboo shoots and good ol green onions. Good stuff.Well now the more I think about it, the more yummy I remember it to be lol. It was though, yummy for sure haha. Just overhyped more than it should be I think.",5
"Rating: 50/100 ptsI had heard rumors proclaiming Daikokuya's greatness ever since setting foot in LA, and I'm surprised it took me this long to make it here.Daikokuya hails straight from Japan and specializes in tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen. This Little Tokyo location is compact (though still almost large by Japanese standards), and with a loyal following of regulars and relentless procession of new challengers, waiting is all part of the experience. And it's no wonder why: Daikokuya is as authentic as they come.I do enjoy me some tonkotsu, and since I like my ramen broth strong, I went for the kotteri (thicker flavored) version of the standard Daikokuya Ramen.The ramen is definitely good, but I guess for being kotteri I was hoping for it to have a bit more bite. The generous amount of green onions is nice, but I was expecting the meat to be a little more substantial. I still ended up drinking it to the bottom of the bowl and being satisfied, but I've had enough comparable ramen in Japan to make Daikokuya feel only average to me.Still, the operative word here is ""feel"". With the amount of subjectivity that comes with judging ramen, there's no way to guess what will strike a chord with you unless you try it yourself; in this case my 3 stars mean ""not especially my preference"" and by no means ""not good ramen"".On another note, their gyoza are actually some of the best Japanese gyoza I've ever had: pan grilled and topped with a delectable layer of crisp, soft &amp; chewy wraps waiting underneath, and each one plump-full of pork enough to necessitate two bites; I'd opine that these are better dumplings than the ramen is ramen, and would definitely recommend getting an order to complete the experience.I hear the line can become quite unbearable, but I managed to line up at 5:30pm on a Saturday, making for a barely noticeable 20 minute wait.",3
"This is the spot in Little Tokyo where everyone is standing outside waiting for a seat. It's a small no-frills restaurant known for their ramen. The wait for five on a Friday night was one hour. They quoted us an hour so the good news is, they know how long it takes. Amble down the street for a drink while you wait. Here are the rules: Cash only. You must have your name on the list. The entire party must be present. Restrooms for customers only. They don't do to-go orders.Waiting is kind of fun. Lots of people gathered around, impromptu conversations, fun spying. The host looked like Jack Sparrow and was quite funny and entertaining. Once you're in, expect quick service. Don't expect that they'll remember what each person ordered or that they'll get it right.The fried rice is ridiculous. I could eat this every day of my life. I ordered the yakisoba and it was really good. Everyone else got the ramen and seemed to enjoy it, I heard nothing but slurping. You get a good portion of food for not a lot of money. Expect to pay $15 including tip for dinner and a shared appetizer.Not that you'll have time to admire it but the decor is fun, it looks like a dive diner in Japan. A true cultural experience. Leaving after nine, there was still a huge line!",4
"This is one of the best Japanese ramen I've had thus far. I've tried many ramen places here in Orange County, specifically Costa Mesa, and this ramen is the best one.I just don't think it's worth the long wait. Wait time averages about an hour, and I would rather eat Japanese ramen in my area where it's just as good (not as good, but just as good), than wait more than hour. They are very generous with their portions though. Very generous.",4
"Went to eat with my family It was my first time ,My sister likes it there,I like it,but the noodle were to hardAnd the bowels smaller then I'm use to lolFor bigger bowl and cheaper I go to little tokyo Shopping center It's ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_$7 and bigger But I like this too I like any and every RAMEN !!!",5
"If you really love ramen, this is totally not the spot to go to. I believe it is more popular because of the area but definitely not my go to ramen spot. The broth was heavy and full of pork fat and just not even spicy",3
"This place is cash only!Daikokuya is one of those must-go-to spots when in Los Angeles, and while I think the ramen itself is probably the best I've had outside of Japan, the 2 hour wait was not worth it.We got the teriyaki eel bowl, Spicy Miso ramen, Daikoku ramen, and another Daikoku ramen with extra kotteri flavor. The portions are really big, so come here hungry! The ramen noodles was very good (I heard they closed for a couple of weeks to go on a ramen-training trip in Japan) and you could tell there was a great amount of skill in the ramen noodle making. However, I think the broth in the ramen carried more of the weight and overpowered the noodles. The regular Daikoku ramen was super flavorful that I think it's fine on its own. The one with the extra kotteri flavor was super good, but got way too rich after only 2 bites. The spicy ramen was my favorite out of the three.",4
"Gyoza - ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_not authentic, doesn't taste that good, and i would never order it again Spicy Miso Ramen - ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If it is your first time, yes go for it. But if u are regular J ramen seeker, i want to say the Ramen was just okay but also there was nothing special about it.One thing is clear, this place is not a best J ramen place in LA.",1
"Went late on a Saturday night (around 9pm) with about an hour wait.First of all, put your name down on the sign in sheet and while you are waiting, go check out the local area. Across the street is a Japanese Market place with tons of cute shops opened until late. If you get tempted, you can also get dessert before your ramen. (The wait time flies by when you kill time in the neighborhood.)Parking: street or paid lot in the local area.Environment: Small restaurant with tables and bar seating. We sat at the bar and was able to watch the ramen masters at work.Service: Hostess didn't know how long the wait was, but other people said it was about 45 minutes. Another couple came back after being called and written down as no show. When they asked the hostess if they can be seated next, since they just missed it, the hostess said yes. Service was quick. We ordered and the food showed up within 10 minutes.Food: Ordered their signature Tonkatsu Ramen Kotteri style. Very flavorful without feeling too heavy and salty. The noodles are to the perfect al dente for the crunch. Comes with Cha Siu and soft boiled egg and more. The soft boiled egg didn't have the full runny effect that I like, but taste good. I like my food spicy. You can ask for chili oil for an addition kick.Overall, I will come back to this place if I need a ramen fix in the LA area. Since I am from the Bay Area, I have to compare it to what I know. It doesn't live up to a couple of ramen places there, but it is very close for being away from home.",4
"I love ramen noodles, so when I was looking for something new to try out I decided to give this place a try. Authentic Japanese noodle bar, nothing fancy just great food.",5
"Fantastic Ramen, but the wait to get it is slow death. Expect a wait. A very long wait. In my case, 60 minutes of staring at my phone while waiting impatiently under the yellow awning. Once you get inside and order, you had better have cash in hand or you will be a very upset person as the wait is in vain. I decided that faithful summer day in front of Daikokuya that my days of hour long waits for lunch may very well be over. The service and restaurant is basically the same as any Ramen den you have visited in your past and the crowd is 50% Asian and 50% hipster which makes sense because you are in Little Tokyo. I went with the Spicy Miso Ramen and suggest you do the same. The silky and delicious broth is rendered from pork bones that were boiled for a day. The pork is Kurobuta and perhaps the most tender I have had in a bowl of Ramen. The eggs are marinated overnight. The noodles are more firm than I anticipated but they do a great job of locking in that gorgeous porky broth so if that is the trade off, so be it. I have to admit Daikokuya is a truly righteous bowl of noodles. About halfway through the meal I realized I was sweating profusely thanks to the lack of ventilation and the absence of air conditioning. It was so hot that eating slowly became uncomfortable and I was unable to finish. Look, 6000+ reviews and 4 star and a half average speaks for itself on many levels and although I think Daikokuya puts out a quality product, I can't say it is worth the line. Or even that it is LA's best ramen (see: Tsujita). I would not go so far as calling Daikokya overrated as clearly the masses have spoken but the fact of the matter is that you can get a much better bowl of slurpables with a quarter of the wait in Santa Monica. Without sweating.",3
"I just can't get enough of this place.. All their locations are always packed to the brim. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_One of the best tasting Japanese Ramen houses in all of SoCal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Pork Bowl with green onions blows my mind, every time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I love the fried rice by itself and don't forget about the Ramune soda. Novelty drink so you won't have to drink all the soda at once, but it's worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Always friendly, always with the Japanese greeting coming and going, even when you don't think they see you leave, they do. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I always take home leftovers and that's always a Plus in My Book.",5
"Reading the reviews, I realized I got lucky on my first time dining here, because we only waited 15 min on a Sunday night! I depended on the Yelp reviews to figure out what was the best thing to order here! We ordered the most popular dishes! Dakikokuya ""regular"" ramen, dakikokuya w/ ""koterri"" flavor, gyoza &amp; shredded pork bowl! I should've ordered the koterri with my dakikokuya ramen it tasted a lot better, but the regular one is fine too. I've never seen gyoza presented this way before, shows how much i consider myself a ""foodie"" lol ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_but also pretty good. What I really loved was the shredded pork bowl! I was kinda so so about ordering it, but we wanted to try it since it was part of the ""combo deals"" If I didn't live so far away, I would order it everyday! haha. Service was fast! Our server was funny &amp; to the point! Nothing is more enjoyable than great company, amazing food &amp; ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_great service! Without a doubt, I would come here again soon!!!",5
"Long wait, but pretty impressive ramen. This was actually the first place I've ever tried restaurant/authentic-style ramen a year ago. The broth was very flavorful and the ramen noodles were al dente. The portions were good as it filled me up! The pork slices were really tender!",5
"Best ramen in town!! Never tried ramen until someone told me I had to try it but not just any ramen, he specifically said ""you must go to Daikokuya in Little Tokyo"" so off we went and sure enough we were hooked!!",5
"Hands down on this gem right here.. everytime me and my hubby go to l.a. we make it a point to stop by.. we actually don't care if the line is crazy, as long as we get their awesomeness.... there's alot of japanese noodle house that we've been through but nothing compared to this!",5
"There was a large group of people waiting to be seated but we didn't have to wait too long. Service was quick and the food came out fast too. I got the Daikoku ramen and it was sooooo yummy! I like it when the broth is ""creamier"". So sad I get full so fast cause I wanted to finish the whole thing!",5
"I've eaten ramen here about 3 or 4 times now, and without fail, it's usually the highlight of my trip to LA... besides seeing my one and only sister, of course. :P Before she introduced me to Daikokuya, I didn't realize there was such a thing as real ramen. For me, ramen only existed as a cheap sodium-packed I'm-on-a-college-student-budget meal. Daikokuya ramen blew my mind! I've only ever gotten their specialty Daikoku ramen bowl. It's amazing and I've never been tempted to try anything else. Their ramen comes in this soup that's so incredible it's hard to describe. Make sure you get the kotteri flavor for the soup, which is richer, fattier, and packed full of flavor. Everything in this bowl is so good and so good together: - Soup: which I've already mentioned - Pork belly: cooked to perfection - Egg noodles - Boiled egg: this is marinated in the soup / soy sauce / whatever it is that makes it delicious and the consistency is just right One time I was there, we saw a sign that said the next week, they would be closed because all their employees were going to be out... it turns out they were going to Japan for a ramen competition. Think of how good they must be to travel that far to compete! I'm running out of adjectives to describe the experience of eating this ramen... I'll leave you with glorious, phenomenal, and spectacular. Yes, the parking is a pain, it's cash only, and there's always always always a wait, but it's sooooo worth it! This is easily one of my top 10 favorite restaurants ever! And the ramen bowl (without any extras) is $9.50. Whaaaat. $9.50 for the best ramen that will ever touch your taste buds (at least, on this side of the Atlantic)... what more is there to say? Go! Right now! Man, writing this makes me want ramen so badly. If I drive to the airport as soon as I post this review, I can probably catch a plane from St. Louis to LA and make it to Daikokuya in time for dinner, right? :]",5
"Huge portions! The combo is definitely worth trying, that way you get a little bit of everything! Wait was about 15 minutes, remember it's CASH ONLY! Parking lot is across the street not too hard to get to! I had never had ramen and it was ranked one of the top in LA. So glad I tried it! it was the perfect double date! Food and service were great!",4
"What can I say in my review that has not been already been captured by the THOUSANDS of people who have eaten here over the years. Well, I'll try. Ramen spots have taken over the US, let's be real. But Daikokuya feels like the first. Rarely do you find really great chewy ramen noodles AND delicious savory pork broth. Usually it's one or the other. That alone is worth 5 stars. What to order: Ramen Combo with any small bowl (try the shredded pork!). Comes with cabbage salad and famous house dressing.Ramen: add a sprinkle of chili powder (togarashi)Optional: add spicy misoLarge Sapporo What not to bring:More than 5 people, max.Lastly, I only am deducting one star for the wait. Two hours is probably not worth noodles.. And it's a fine line between wait time and delicious noodles for me. Maybe 1.15 hrs is my breakeven. And at 1.15 hours only if you are smart about it and visit the delicious Mochi shop next door to bide time. OR be even smarter about it, and put your party name on the list at both Daikokuya and the udon restaurant next door. First one to call my name, wins! Today, Daikokuya won ...and thankfully so.",4
"LOVE DAIKOKUYA! The wait is always worth it. I usually try to come in with just a friend or two to grab a seat at the bar. I always order the Daikoku Ramen in a half order Kotteri flavored and it's amazing. If you have room, or are sharing with a friend, I'd suggest the fried rice!",5
"Expect to wait at LEAST 30 min, more if you're in a large group. Put your name down and get a drink at one of the nearby bars in the meantime",5
"Good, seated us quickly compared to other places in Little Tokyo that have 1-2+ waits. I got the Wonton Ramen ($10.75), and it was tasty! The 3 wontons were very large and savory, but the miso base perhaps could have had a little more flavor. Over all it was a good lunch! My friends who got the Spicy salmon roll and the spicy tuna rolls said the fish was fresh!",4
"My initial thought, as I stepped into this ramen shop, was how HOT and STUFFY it was inside. Apparently, their AC units and fans weren't turned on; I'm guessing maybe they weren't working. It didn't help that Daikokuya itself occupied such a small space. You could roughly only seat about 7 tables. To be fair, LA was extremely hot (temperatures at approximately 100ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¡) the weekend I went, but Daikokuya only hastened my impending heat stroke. Having said that, the ramen here is delicious. I felt like I was in a bittersweet love triangle between the very much needed air circulation to stay alive and the delectable ramen served here, at Daikokuya. Like all bittersweet endings go, only one choice must be made reluctantly. As I was sweating up a storm, I ordered the Daikoku Ramen ($9.50) and my little sister ordered the Shredded Pork Bowl ($8.95). My party of 6 altogether had ordered different dishes but we agreed to simply eat and leave to save ourselves from our imminent doom. Delicious fatty thick pork broth + broken AC units and fans = BEAUTIFUL DEATH BY RAMENOne of the most important aspects when it comes to ramen, in my case, is the egg. I love my yolks slightly uncooked, orangey and gooey and Daikokuya's eggs are soso good! They are a bit on the saltier side but nevertheless, perfect golden yolk.I definitely would think twice about that time you passed by a printed cheery blossom rice paper fan and decided you did not need it. GURL, you need it. You do not want to be looking like a pig in heat aka me after I hastily finished my bowl of ramen.",4
"surprising good food..... ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_lot of drama but hang in there.. worth the hassle, but remember kids its ramen",3
"Good Ramen! This is the only place that comes close to Japan. If I'm craving Ramen, I will make the drive to come here. I love the environment. The inside looks almost similar to the restaurants in Japan. Great place!",5
"Daikokuya: Just your average typical ramen with pork, boiled egg and bamboo shoots, the broth is a little to savory, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_huge portion, nothing special. Eel Rice: It came with the combo. My friend recommended it but it fell short on my high expectation. It's a little too sweet, but the texture of the eel is on point. Not bad overall. Gyoza: Average. Cash only. Not worth the long line waiting.",3
The waiting list to this place is always long but we decided to wait for the place anyway since we haven't tried the ramen here before! We put our name on the list and we waited inside the small restaurant near the door. The waitress who called the numbers spoke so softly like she wasn't even trying and we missed our call because we didn't hear her.After talking to her she said she would call our number the next time she calls but she forgot and so she called another number..We had to go up and tell her again when she came by to call numbers.The ramen was really good though! I had the kotteri(?) $9.59? I think? It adds back fat so the broth has a thicker texture and also you can taste more of the pork.Personally I loved it! It's no additional cost! The food also came fast! Overall I would come again!,4
Pedestrian Ramen house. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not the best but definitely decent. I usually get a combo - that's usually a ramen bowl and a small rice bowl paired with. Really filling and made me walk around little Tokyo for a while to burn some calories. I also enjoy the small cabbage salad with their famous house dressing. Really yummy. Service is fast and attentive. At times there may be a line but they move quickly and you'll be able to sit and eat promptly.,4
"Just incredible that's all I can say about the food, the service and atmosphere. Be ready though for a long wait ( an hour or more). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They serve lots of food and you have to try the fried rice. It's like no other that I have eaten . ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A+++ restaurant",5
"Arrived on a Saturday at around 4pm and there was about a thirty minute wait for two. They only have a couple of tables and a bar. After reading the reviews I got my ramen with the kotteri broth and it was great! You get your food pretty fast once you get seated and it comes out piping hot. The broth was rich and fatty. The egg was cooked perfectly. The meat was really soft and fell apart as I tried to pick it up. I usually prefer thicker ramen noodles but these thin ones were surprisingly good. If you like your ramen spicy ask for the chili oil. It adds spice to the broth without altering the flavor too much. I also ended up adding some of the grated garlic that was available at the table. I think I came during one of the hottest days this summer so it was a struggle for me to fully enjoy my meal in there. I don't think they have AC. My god it was so freaking hot in there...This place is kind of hard to spot but you'll know because of the people waiting outside. And for those who care, this place has a B health rating.",4
"the portions are nice. there are basically 2 kinds of ramen (daikokuya and spicy miso), but you can add different sides in a combo. personally, the ramen is nothing special but it is still good",4
"I love this little hole in the wall joint. Their ramen is on point and the house salad is so very delicious considering it is just simply cabbage and dressing. Oh, you must try their sausage!! it is so freaking awesome! Perfect place to visit on a rainy evening! but I would drop by on sunny day, windy day, whatever the weather calls. LOL.The service is great, they are SUPER busy but servers are always attentive with genuine smiles. The wait can get very long depending on when you stop by but it is well worth the wait. Parking is a challenge especially if you are not familiar with DTLA. I am keeping one star away because of their flooring and how slippery it gets. The floor is very uneven and with so much traffic of people and food being served, if you are a lady wearing high heels, BE CAREFUL not to slip &amp; fall~",4
"Honestly, I wasn't very impressed with Daikokuya. Definitely not the best ramen I've had and not worth the 1 hour + wait. Their broth was pretty bland to me and tasted just like any other ramen shop. It's a super tiny place and seating was soo uncomfortable at the thin bar table. My elbows kept rubbing against the person next to me and I was so scared my bowl of hot ramen would fall onto my lap. The table and floors were pretty dirty too :/ For ramen, I would prefer to go right next door to Manichi where there's less wait and the broth is much more flavorful. Overall, I'm glad I got to try Daikokuya but I seriously think it's just all hypee.",3
"Pretty solid ramen. I'm in the LA area for a few days, and my friend said that this was the typical tourist place/the most popular ramen place in LA, and I was pretty pleased. We got really lucky since we went on a random Wednesday so there actually wasn't much of a line. When we got in there, they were calling out names really quickly, and then there was only one group ahead of us so we got seated in maybe around 5 minutes. Both my friend and I ordered the Daikoku Ramen which came out in maybe around 15 minutes. Despite our quick wait, the place was still packed and there seemed to always be a steady, though short queue of people outside.I was pretty happy with this ramen. Broth was delicious and of a tonkatsu base, chasiu was chewy and yummy, and the noodles were firmer than usual but just how I liked it. They also weren't super thick which was nice. The other thing that struck me about this place was how thin its soup base was. I'm from the Bay Area and thick soup bases with a ton of oil are very much in right now, so it was super refreshing to go to a place that had a thin soup base that I actually wanted to drink. The soft-boiled egg was okay, but I've had better. Overall, I just felt like the combination of all the ingredients and the execution was really well done. I would have preferred if they gave me more bamboo shoots, but when you have the noodles down and a strong soup base, I feel like you've gotten the hardest part of the bowl of ramen done which is awesome. But yeah it was super delicious and I am mostly definitely a fan!You can also get a number of combos of ramen with other dishes should you want katsu, chicken terriyaki, sashimi, etctldr; really yummy ramen located in Little Tokyo, def a fan. I wouldn't say it blew my mind or anything, but I definitely thought it was very yummy",4
"Came around 6pm on a Monday night. We waited 30 minutes for a table. There is very limited seated, but I heard great things about this place (I'm sure that's why it's so crowded). My order:Daikoku Ramen! A must try if you come here. The broth was very tasty, not too salty or sweet. It was at a warm temperature. The egg, which I look forward to most in ramen, was at room temperature so it did not taste good! The noodles were chewy, and not soft. They were not soaked in the water long enough. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall, it was an average bowl of ramen and I've tasted better. It did not live up to the hype.",3
This place has great service. Very friendly on point with their order. Lunch hours get busy but worth the wait.,5
"Came here to extend my bi-coastal ramen experience collection. Found the broth to be on the bland side, but really loved their small orders - couldn't get enough of the tofu nuggets, and also really loved their sashimi, which isn't common for ramen joints. Overall not the best as far as ramen goes (or Daikokuya franchises go...), and the planning/travel stress for getting a seat is way over the top. Still would recommend to ramen lovers on the west coast.",4
Long wait but worth it! It's hard to find parking but I just park in the structure nearby or park in the Office Depot parking lot and buy something from yogurtland after to get parking validation. Definitely get their ramen and we've also tried their rice bowl. It's a good place to go with a group of friends. Good service and the food is consistently flavorful.,4
"Rated as the best ramen in LA yet tiger den in Houston is much much better in term of broth . Yet the combo deal is a steal. Yummy fresh salmon. However tokoyaki ( squid ball ) is not good, it is deep fried instead of the traditional way ( ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had this in Japan so...). Other than that good place for ramen in LA",3
"Ramen is 4/5, but interior (inaccessible &amp; super crammed tables &amp; super tiny waiting area - forcing everyone to wait outside) slightly brings the rating down. I can only imagine the difficulty people in wheelchairs would have if they wanted to eat here! I came here this past weekend &amp; ordered the Daikukoya special Ramen. It was a Sunday around 12 p.m. &amp; the wait time was about 40 to 45 minutes. It is a very small establishment so, like I said, the seating is very compact. There isn't much Elbow Room inside the dining booths themselves, so you definitely don't want to do more than a party of five or six maximum (and that includes kids). Now onto the ramen, it was very flavorful &amp; delicious! It came out rather quickly &amp; the broth was very rich &amp; creamy. I love the boiled egg, veggies &amp; soft tender meat that came with it. The meat literally broke into pieces just by the mere touch of my chopstick, AHHH. The noodles were medium-thick, soft yet firm!! :) just perfect! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I originally thought the ramen tasted pretty comparable to places I've had in other areas, including Sacramento, but after trying the ramen shops back here in Norcal, I'm craving this place!! I guess my body knows better than me!!. In brutal honesty, I can't help but suspect there's another place that's better. Maybe I'll have to go to Japan to find out! However, I will likely return if I'm in the area! ;)",3
"Ramen with egg and butter topping is heavenly! The edamame and fried rice are so tasty. Be prepared for a long wait, but so worth it. Service is fast and friendly. Spicy miso ramen can be made mild.",5
"For the huge line you'd expect to eat the best ramen ever but I personally don't think it's that great. The noodles are very thin and the broth is okay. It felt like something was missing. The service is pretty fast here so once you sit down and order your food, you'll most likely get your food in a matter of minutes. The tables here a bit awkward if you're not fond of sitting next to other parties. I think this place is good but not enough to recommend it to others.",3
"This review is for their tsukemen, it was poorly executed. They made the tsukemen pretty much same as their ramen but with the soup on the side .. The broth was not very thin, not rich and thick like a tsukemen should be.. The soup was just their regular kotteri broth.. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So I ended just pour everything in to the bowl to make it a regular soup ramen, it came with 5 pieces of bamboo shoot , I like bamboo shoot so I ordered extra, instead of boil it first the extra bamboo shoot came out cold , when I pour them in my soup made the whole bowl of ramen cold... The noodles themselves they use is not the proper noodle type they were just generic sun noodle like other place uses. The egg and Cha shu was on point.. I have been to this place few times including their other locations usually order kotteri, but thought to give tsukemen a try, it failed and I probably won't go back again.. If you are reading this and lookin for tsukemen I suggest to go to Tsujita LA, it's much more authentic and what a tsukemen should be. I haven't ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_try their annex location next time in town I will give that a try. Hope this review helps you.",1
"Went there for late lunch around 2:30 pm today, waited about 10 mins to be seated, I was hoping to see that Monday afternoon would be a less busy though...I ordered one roasted pork for appetizer and the spicy miso ramen, that roasted pork was soft and tender with a bit fat, sooooo good! For the Ramen, honestly if I had this ramen in Japan, I wouldn't give it 4 stars, but it did taste similar to those I've ever had in Japan, so what else could I ask for when I'm in U.S..!",4
"Still the Top 1 ramen place for me!! Authentic Japanese ramen, perfectly cooked noodles, thick and rich broth, tender chashu meat, and the egg bomb!! Whew!! . takoyaki is also the best!",5
"I finally was able to eat at this place since I am always discouraged by the long wait. Daikokuya is very popular in the area so luckily I was able to be seated in 15 minutes. I ordered the daikoku ramen bowl. The broth is very rich in pork flavor. You can taste that it was simmered for a long period of time.As far as service, I rate the waiters five stars. They are very friendly and are quick to take your orders and ensure fast turnarounds.",4
"Finally had the chance to try this very famous ramen joint and boy I am thankful I did. I came around 3pm on a Friday and got seated right away but I understand why this place would have a long line during rush hour. I got the daikokuya ramen with kotteri. It actually does taste quite different from the regular, with an extra savory dimension. Compared to Ramen Dojo from the bay(which is my favorite from the bay), Daikokuya opened up a whole new perspective on what great ramen could be. Like other great ramen places, the broth is hearty and full of flavor and the noodles have enough structure for that chewiness that I love so much. What sets this place apart though is the extra dimension on its noodles. In a word, their noodles could be described as ""velvety"". The noodles were smooth yet soft feeling and held onto the broth flavor so exceedingly well. I've never had anything like it before. Just wow. As much as I love ramen, I don't believe in waiting an hour+ for it, but for this place....maybe?",5
Worth the hype. Spicy miso ramen is excellent and the fried rice is a MUST. It's the best and most flavorful fried rice I've had.,5
"I don't think I've ever had ramen this good. The spicy miso ramen was so rich (without being overbearing) and flavorful, it could be a sauce on its own. I'd dip everything in it (and maybe use it as moisturizer). I prefer noodles that are a little thicker and these were prepared to perfection with a little bite but still perfect for slurping. The chashu pork literally melts in the mouth, releasing more of the amazing broth with each bite. And the egg...Daikokuya, never stop soft boiling. Just that small luxury of a soft boil really took the whole bowl to a new level.With the crunchy takoyaki and a nice cold beer on the side, needless to say, I was extremely stuffed by the end of my meal. Takoyaki wasn't anything to write home about but it will satisfy any takoyaki cravings instantly.Now while I have no qualms about the food, allow me to point out factors that affect the overall atmosphere. This place could really use a deep clean. The tables, chairs, the menus...makes a group of sticky toddlers seem like neat freaks. The floor was slippery making a walk to the bathroom slightly treacherous. Additionally, I love that extra condiments like ginger and garlic sauce are left on the table for customers to consume to their heart's desire but at the same time, it's also another way food can start crossing over the ""nasty"" line. I loved the garlic sauce because I love garlic. Not so much how viscous and gloopy it was as I plopped it from its container to my bowl.But don't worry, Daikokuya. I'll still come back, hungry for more of the best ramen I've ever had.",4
"Best Ramen I've had in Socal. Be prepared to wait, best thing to do is sign in and walk around lil toyko.",5
"It's been hot and humid lately (since when do we have monsoon weather in LA?!), but when I head into Little Tokyo, I automatically start to crave ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya is easily identifiable amongst the shops crammed together along E 1st St in Little Tokyo by the bright yellow awning and crowds of people waiting outside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Walk inside to put your name on the list, and then try to find a shaded spot along the sidewalk to wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It can be hard to determine how long the wait will be because several people ahead of us put their names down and then left, but at a non-peak hour, we waited about thirty minutes for a party of two to be seated at the bar. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Multiple signs inside clearly state that this location is CASH ONLY. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Spicy miso ramen is my go-to ramen, and Daikokuya does an excellent job. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I added the spicy oil, but didn't really notice any difference. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is rich and creamy even without ordering kotteri, and the noodles are chewy al dente perfection. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork is thinly sliced and the egg is just cooked until the edges of the yolk are set but the center is still runny. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The spice level is pretty mild, and even the addition of the spicy oil does not kick up the spiciness very much. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We also ordered the Daikoku ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you have the spicy miso and the Daikoku ramen side by side, then the Daikoku ramen is going to suffer by comparison. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The spicy miso is rich and full of umami flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Taste it first and then try the Daikoku ramen, and the Daikoku ramen will taste bland and under seasoned. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, this is not a fair comparison. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Daikoku tonkotsu ramen broth is subtle and clean, with the same great noodles, pork belly chashu, and boiled egg. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall, an excellent bowl of ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This location does not have nearly as much charm as the Sawtelle location, which is decorated to make you feel like you're sitting in a neighborhood ramen shop in a Japan. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Sitting at the bar, the radiant heat from the giant vats of boiling broth will make you feel as hot and steamy as your ramen, but bonus points for having purse hooks!4 Stars: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A wonderfully executed bowl of ramen, but if the wait is too long, there are many other great choices nearby.",4
"This place really did live up to expectations. My friend who's an LA native had brought me here proclaiming this was ""one of the best ramen places in LA,"" and it kind of was.Being from the bay area, I feel like I've eaten a lot of good ramen. And this place didn't just hit the spot, it went above and beyond.I ordered the Daikoku ramen. To start with, the broth was wonderful and so flavorful. I really think the broth made it. The ramen noodles were normal ramen noodles, and the egg and pork were good too. I got the regular sized bowl, which is huge and could probably last for 2 meals. They also have a half size bowl, which was perfect for one of my friends.The wait to be seated is fairly long though. You have to put your name on the list, and they slowly go through the list. It took us (a party of 4) about 45 minutes to be seated. However, the restaurant is really good about bringing food out very quickly. I guess that's how they keep customers moving. I was really surprised about how fast our food came out! Aside from that, the overall service is pretty normal. And they definitely are quick to bring out the check (which keeps people moving).",5
"The flavor of the dishes here is unsurpassable,in my opinion!My family and I are never disappointed,well worth the wait",5
"As of writing this review, Daikokuya in Little Tokyo has the best ramen I've ever eaten by far! There was a decent line formed outside the door when I had arrived and I thought it was going to take a while, but it only took less than 10 minutes for me to be seated. It took even less time for me to get my order taken, and even LESS time for me to be served my combination plate of Daikokuya Ramen, a small pork cutlet bowl, and salad with their signature dressing. I was eating far quicker than I expected and that honestly worried me a bit at first, but a few slurps in and I was hooked until it was all gone. The noodles tasted fantastic, and the broth tasted significantly better than other ramen spots I've been to. I ordered extra meat and noodles thinking the portions might be small, but I had to force most of it down by the end and didn't even have enough room to eat my Tonkatsu bowl! I ate it at home and it was actually really good, even though it wasn't as fresh btw. Tldr I definitely will be back here, as their ramen is by far my favorite!",5
"Every time I'm in Little Tokyo the wait to eat here is just way too long but last Saturday my cousins and I committed to wait it out and after an hour and a half, I officially checked this place off my list. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We were starving and when our number was called we were so excited to eat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ordered the gyoza and the kurobota sausages to start with and they were pretty good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We each ordered a combo and by recommendation by another friend waiting in line I got the poke bowl with the daikokuya ramen kotteri style. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The green onion on top was overkill and the broth was not life changing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles were chewy, the pork was really soft, a little too soft for my liking and the egg was tasty but a little over cooked for the standard ramen soft boiled. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The poke I did not like as it had a overwhelming amount of roe all around the fish and the flavors just did not go with the ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall, I was disappointed and I might have expected too much from Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I really wanted to like this place and give it a great review but I've had better and unfortunately the wait was not worth it.",2
"Awesome restaurant with cozy Japanese vibes. First of all, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the wait was pretty long but after putting our name down and walking around for 25 minutes, it was our turn next. Got their combo which included their specialty daikokuya Ramen, a small salad with their special dressing and a small portion of one of their entrees. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I chose their beef bowl. Solid flavor and the food came out quick! Went well with a draft beer and the portions was great.",4
"I *needed* to come here as a big ramen fan when I found all the glowing reviews on Yelp. I have to say that it's probably the best ramen I've had. My only regret is that I don't actually live in LA so this would be my first and last trip to here. Oh Daikokuya... you will forever live in my heart.Atmosphere:It's a tiny little cramped restaurant with bar-side seats and a handful of booths. At first glance, unimpressive. However, the fact that the place is absolutely buzzing with people including a queue is a dead giveaway that this place is the real deal.Customer Service:If you're patient enough to handle the wait, the customer service is pretty great. They are attentive and efficient with getting food out. There were maybe 5 other people on the waiting list ahead of my friend and I, but we only had to wait about 20 minutes or so - surprisingly wasn't that bad, considering!Food:We ordered the ""Sliced Roast Pork"" as an appetiser for 5.95 to start off our meal. Seared pork belly with a lovely sweet and tangy glaze. The meat was melt-in-our-mouths incredible!For myself, I ordered a combination of Daikoku Ramen &amp; Small Pork Cutlet Bowl. Ended up being too much food because I didn't expect the ramen bowls to be MASSIVE! What generous portions, well worth the price. The chasyu meat was fantastic and tender. The noodles perfect texture, and the broth wonderfully flavourful and rich. Like I said earlier, the best ramen I've had.The only reason why this place doesn't get 5 stars from me is that I didn't enjoy the pork cutlet ricebowl that much. The pork was a bit overcooked and tough to chew. Otherwise, it was an absolute perfect experience.Would definitely recommend to any and all ramen lovers!",4
"My friend and I got there at 11:10 and the place was already full. We waited about 45 minutes to be seated. I feel bad for the people who came in 5-10 minutes after us because they had to wait for our round of people to eat. Well, I guess when you come here you know what you're getting yourself into.We ordered the fried spicy tuna, the daikokuya ramen kotteri flavor (richer broth), and the daikokuya ramen set with the pork cutlet bowl.The fried spicy tuna came out, and honestly it was just ok. It wasn't as tasty as I had expected.Next we the pork cutlet came out. Maybe because all my expectation was on the ramen that the flavor from the pork cutlet bowl was so unexpected. It was SO good! The rice was perfect with the right about of broth and saltiness. The pork cutlets were cooked great and tender enough I didn't have to use knife to cut off portions. And the egg, yum. We got the daikokuya ramen one regular and one kotteri style. They were both rich and full of flavor. Neither were overly salty, which often happens. My egg wasn't cooked so the yolk was gooey but maybe u waited too long to open it? The noodles were cooked well too. Overall the ramen was very tasty and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't the wow I was expecting. I actually like totto and ippudo in New York equally or maybe event better. It was still very good, but I'm not sure I would want to wait about an hour for it again. Or maybe because the pork cutlet bowl was such a surprise, I actually wouldn't mind having that again. When I think about this meal, that's what I remember most. It was so good.",4
They served me raw pork (the tankatsu.) Not apologetic. Quite the contrary. They didn't really seem to care at all.,1
"Longest wait ever but it's probably the best in Los Angeles I've ever had . But I still prefer ramen dojo in NorCal ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I honestly don't think I would come back cause I don't like it enough to wait 2+ hours Daikokuyas broth is very rich and creamy like. The noodles are thin but firm and slightly chewy which is how I like it. Preferably I would want thicker noodles but this one isn't too bad.It didn't have much in the bowl but the meat , bean sprouts and green onions. I would have to pay extra for other toppings . I got it as a combo. It included a salad , but the thinlyyyyy cut cabbage salad . The sauce was good but I'm not a fan of the salad I was also able to choose a side dish, and I got the pork cutlet. I didn't like it at all. It was soggy and it was too sweet for me. The Gyoza was a disappointment too. I read great things about it but meh. Nothing special about it ..",2
"I went to this location for the first time around 11 p.m. on a Friday for dinner, and I was surprised at how crowded it still was ... and the fact that there was a line outside. My group of friends and I had a huge lunch beforehand, so we didn't mind waiting, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal once it was our turn.The second time I went to Daikokuya was on a Monday for dinner around 5 p.m. I remembered my experience from the first time and was prepared for a long wait. This time, however, I was surprised - we could walk right in and there was no wait time! Our party was not scheduled to meet for dinner until 6 p.m., but my mom and I went early to put our name in, thinking that there would be a line. However, we couldn't get a table because your ENTIRE party has to be present in order for you to be seated. The fans are going and this eatery is really small, so you may feel a bit claustrophobic, but the food is worth the wait! Just be forewarned that you'll be sweating a lot if you go on a hot day ... but really, this is one of my favorite spots when it comes to ramen/Japanese food. Wish that I had discovered it earlier.Here's what we got: ""Gyoza"": The gyoza here is really unique in both shape and texture. This app features pan-fried dumplings with a mix of pork and vegetables inside. They're more rectangular and shape and come topped with green onions. I enjoyed the crispiness of the exterior, but it wasn't too crunchy for my liking. I was glad I got to try this homemade dish and would definitely order it again. ""Takoyaki"": I recently developed a liking for octopus, and these fried octopus balls didn't disappoint. I believe 5-6 balls come with an order. I could sufficiently taste the octopus in every one, and I really enjoyed the deep-fried exterior. Just be careful - they're really hot (in temperature) when they first come to your table. ""Daikoku Ramen"": Both my mom and one of my friends ordered this dish, since Daikokuya is known for their ramen. This signature item features the eatery's famous tonkotsu soup based, infused with a soy sauce and accompanied by egg noodles, kurobuta pork belly chashu, a marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, green onions, bean sprouts and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. You can also ask for the richer, my flavorful kotteri flavor (which uses added soup extracted from the back fat), or you could be like my mom and subtract ingredients (like the green onions and egg) from the ramen order. My mom and my friend enjoyed the ramen, praising the flavor as well as the freshness of the noodles. I haven't ordered ramen from this place yet, but if I did, I would probably opt for that ultra-savory kotteri flavor.""Shredded Pork Bowl"": This has to be my favorite dish from this place. I liked it so much when I ordered it the first time that I couldn't bring myself to deviate from it when I visited Daikokuya again. This bowl features the kurobuto pork belly grilled and served over rice with green onions, pickled ginger and a sweet glaze. During my first visit, the BF and I shared the full bowl order because we weren't starving and had ordered an appetizer. For me, it was love at first bite - the pork was tender, flavorful and moist and the sweet glaze really added (and they didn't skimp on the glaze). We ordered the green onions on the side because I don't like green onions, but he does. On my second visit to Daikokuya, we ordered one of the combinations--""Daikoku Ramen + Small Shredded Pork Bowl""--so I could have the pork bowl again but I ordered one of the other appetizers as well. The combinations are actually a good choice because they still come with the salad (I love Japanese salad because it's light and I usually like the dressing on top). I highly recommend this shredded pork bowl if you want to order something instead of/besides ramen. You won't be disappointed. ""Teriyaki Eel Bowl"": If I didn't get that ""Shredded Pork Bowl,"" this is the bowl I would have ordered instead since I love fresh eel. Based on the photos that I saw on Yelp, they don't skimp when it comes to the eel size/portion. The entrÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©e sounds simple enough - eel over a bowl of rice and covered with sweet teriyaki glaze. Definitely can't wait to try this option one day. ""Fried Rice"": Since I actually prefer fried rice over steamed rice, I want to try the Daikokuya version one day. This entrÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©e contains onions, green onions, egg, corn, imitation crab and chopped chashu pork with rice. I would probably ask for my fried rice sans the onions, but everything else in there--especially the chashu and imitation crab--makes this fried rice concoction sound like a winner.",5
"Wow! What a jewel of a find! My daughter found this place while we were vacationing in my old stumping grounds. Being I taught her most of what she knows about good food, i trust her recommendations. From infancy she's been brought up enjoying some of the finest cuisine, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_so when she stumbled across this hole in the wall while touring Japan town, I followed. The li e of 30 plus waiting outside told me I was in the right place, and boy was I not disappointed! I started out with a large Asahi beer, their salad with house specific dressing, and miso soup that was anything but customary like most Japanese restaurants. Then came the spicey tuna roll, super fresh and came quickly. My beef rice bowl quickly followed. With everything I ordered on the table within maybe 5 minutes and piping hot, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I begain my conquest! Like an a cave man, i grunted and gobbled everything down, cooling my mouth often with Asahi from the temperature hot excellent mom &amp; pop traditional cusine. With the small restaurant packed with both Japanese &amp; everyone else, the sound of happy eaters and slurping ramen bowl enthusiasts made for an awesome experience! You must try!!!",5
Omg this place is da bomb. My friend and i knew that 5000+ yelp reviews with almost 3000 pics had to stand for something. I was not disappointed. . I was a little shocked at how small the place was. . We had to wait about 20 min for a spot but it was so worth the wait. We got the gyoza - I got the daikoku Ramen with thr salmon sashimi rice. I ate until I jus about busted. The broth was so good!! My friend got the spicy miso Ramen with the fried rice. The rice is da bomb. I would have ate all that too if I had the room. We can't wait to go back in the next 2 days :) Like what the previous yelper said... This place is the truth :),5
"This review is specifically in response to my experience at this location on February 18, 2017 around 11 pm.I dined in a group of three. The spicy miso ramen I ordered was good, but when the three of us put down our payments for the bill, the waitress carried the bill in one hand and a bunch of our dishes in another. A few minutes later, she returned, saying we were short. I saw that the bill tray had one $20 fewer than it did when the waitress carried it away. All three of us clearly saw each other place their respective cash payment on the platter; we had each counted out our share to each other. The place is cash-only, and there was no way for us to prove we'd given her the right amount and that she'd lost (or stolen, but I don't think she's that dishonest) one of the $20 bills. Because of the way she was carrying the bill tray along with tons of dishes, I'm guessing a $20 fell away from air resistance, and she didn't notice because she was doing too much at once.So I ended up putting down another $20. I withdrew $60 from the ATM on the walk over to Daikokuya and now only had $20 in my wallet, so I knew (in addition to all three of our memories) that the waitress had lost one of the $20s. Because of her mistake, I lost $20.This place has good ramen, and I hate to leave a bad review for a place I've enjoyed multiple times, but I can't overlook when a place loses my money like that. I won't be coming back to this location or to any other Daikokuyas again.",1
"The food is worth the hype here. My friend and I visited on a Tuesday at around 11:30 and got seated within 15 minutes, but saw the wait list just jump in size by noon. I would definitely recommend taking an early lunch if you come to this place.I tried the Gyoza, the Daikoku Ramen and Shredded Pork Bowl.The Gyoza reminded me of a gyoza place I've tried in Kyoto, Japan. It had the really good amount of crispness and flavor. The ramen was flavorful and the broth was a bit lighter than what I am used to; which I preferred. The chashu was tender and sliced to a really good size. My friend really enjoyed the Shredded Pork Bowl, but I am personally more of a noodles person that a rice person.",4
"It's a wonderful ramen place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It lives up to the hype with the line and the good food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, as a medium size fellow, it was very uncomfortable for me because the place is a bit cramped. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Was it worth the wait, sitting uncomfortably, and so on? Yes it is. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_To all the new comers, I would recommend coming an hour early or have at least an hour of kill time because the line is long. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This may be a sit down restaurant, but don't expect great service. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's the same as in Japan, ramen restaurants are for people to come in, eat, and leave. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not big on loitering, if you finish your meal, pay and leave, or else the ppl waiting in line will stare hahaha",4
"Hands down the best Ramen place in LA. There's a reason it's Zagat rated. The ramen here is delicious. Depending on how ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_bad your ramen craving is, the 30min to 1 hour or more wait is worth it. What's REALLY the best is their fried rice. I could eat that all day! But the ramen is legit the best in town. Unfortunately for me, I don't live near Little Tokyo so it's a drive to get there and parking is tricky. There's street parking and then some garages but those charge a lot. Take the metro and go for an early dinner.",5
"First off, I love the hole in the wall feel of this place. Also the workers are very kind and very accommodating. As an appetizer I had the octopus balls and dumplings, both of which I enjoyed. The dumplings were made differently but I enjoyed it, more than the octopus balls. The ramen noodles taste fresh. I tried the original broth and the ""spicy"" broth is a let down though. By the way, the ramen bowls are HUGE. Two people can finish one bowl, if you did not have an appetizer(s).",3
I had their signature bowl of Daikoku ramen and it was excellent. The service was really good as well. This was an especially nice surprise given the popularity of this spot. That leads to the one negative which was the wait. We got there at 11:15 am and still had to wait 45 mins. Worth it though.,4
"Tried this place for the first time, didnt find anything special about it but it was decent. The wait is alittle long though, this place is pretty small. I had the combo that came with the ramen, salad and chicken katsu rice bowl. My cousin had the cold noodles, which i found very refreshing! If i were to come back i would definitely get that, from my understanding they don't have that item often on their menu.",3
"There is nothing all that special about the ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've been coming here for the past few years and a couple of months ago, just realized how expensive and unexceptionable the food is. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is okay and too salty for me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles themselves just didn't seem that fresh. The egg was just old and weird looking (like old gelatin). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Long WAITING list and lines that clog the sidewalk. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Please. . .",2
"Um, a ramen place with over 5000 reviews??? I needed to check Daikokuya out while I was in Little Tokyo. I strolled on by around 130PM hoping that maybe the lunch rush was over. Nope! There were tons of people waiting outside. And a few inside too. I wrote my name down on the list - there were many parties ahead of me. When you write your name down, remember what number order you are on the list (#1, 2, 3 etc). When the server came out to call for people, she called the number order and not always the name of the person. Sometimes she would and sometimes she wouldn't so it was kind of confusing. I had to go back inside to check what number I was on the list. Fast forward 45 minutes. Yes, I waited 45 minutes to get seated. Sigh. That's still shorter than how long I waited for Orenchi the last time I went! The server thanked me for waiting - I appreciated that! I got seated at the bar and looked at the menu. I already knew that I wanted the Daikoku ramen - when unsure, I go with the namesake ramen. I flipped through the menu and saw that they had a ramen combo. You could get the Daikoku ramen plus a small rice bowl and salad. I thought it was a pretty good deal so I chose to do that - ramen with the chicken egg rice bowl (oyako donburi). The server came to take my order and she gave me water and salad right away. The salad was shaved cabbage with their housemade salad dressing. It was okay - I didn't finish it. My ramen and rice bowl came out pretty quick - it was longer than five minutes but less than 10 minutes. The ramen was yummy! The noodles were chewy and cooked well. For me, the noodles are really important. The broth has to be good too (which it was), but I don't drink all of the broth. I eat all the noodles. The egg was good too - I like mine to be a little more runny in the yolk. The rice bowl was good too.The place has a cute retro look to it - it's decorated with Japanese-vintage looking posters and trinkets. It's not a huge space - there's bar and couple of tables. There's an ATM (this place is CASH ONLY) and a restroom in the back. The service was really great - the girls who work here are really friendly. They thanked me when I paid and also thanked me again as I was leaving. When I left around 3PM there were still LOTS of people waiting to eat here. I feel like there is never a down-time at this ramen place. It's pretty good ramen - but just be ready to wait. And wait. And wait some more.",4
"My boo thang and I have visited Daikokuya twice during two separate trips to California and have been thoroughly satisfied with both meals. We've had both their hot ramens: daikoku and spicy miso. The noodles are perfectly cooked to a nice chewy texture and both broths are super flavorful. The ramens come with a marinated egg, a couple pieces of charsiu and dressed with the usual bamboo, nori, bean sprouts and green onions. I like to add more bamboo and corn to mine to kick up the bombness level just a tad. The bowls are larger than your average soup bowls so you may have some leftovers for that midnight snackage. As you can see, this place is a yelp super star so expect to wait anywhere from 30-60 minutes for a table. Do yourself a favor and come in and put your name down before you're hangry. It's worth the wait.",5
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in LA/ Little Tokyo area. It is tough to get a seat inside most of the time, because the line is very long. If you are not running short on time and have a company or two, I think Daikokuya is well worth the wait. I haven't tried all of the items on the menu, but all the items I have tried are great. I've tried their standard ramen, shredded pork bowl (my favorite,) fried rice, and gyoza. I highly recommend it!",5
"Can't really beat Daikokuya. Having been to the one in Alhambra, I wasn't sure I could expect the same experience, but this is hands-down one of the best ramen restaurants around. Understand that there will probably be a wait, though, as it's very popular.",5
"Yummm. Def did not like this place the first time I had it years ago. They only offered one type of ramen back then. I felt that it was super bland and had things I needed to pick out. The only thing I liked was the chicken and egg bowl lol. As years went on, I kept hearing how good it was though but, refused to try it again.Fast forward to this week..my friend mentioned Daikokuya having good reviews and seeing how I always choose where we eat, I decided to just let her choose. Once I saw Spicy Miso Ramen and Tsukemen on the menu, I was sold!!!What We Ordered- Spicy Miso Ramen with a Salmon Sashimi Bowl- Tsukemen Ramen with a Chicken and Egg BowlYumm! The Tsukemen Ramen was good! The broth wasn't extremely salty like Tsujita. However, the Spicy Miso Ramen was better! I will definitely get that next time! The Chicken and Egg Bowl was not how I remembered it. The rice was overcooked and mushy, heavily soy sauced, and sweet. I will be back for the Spicy Miso Ramen!!! :)",4
"I love coming here for Ramen! In my opinion, this is the best Daikokuya compared to all the other ones. I usually get the ramen combo with the shredded pork-belly rice bowl. My personal favorite! Lines usually super long here so don't be surprised to wait at least 20-45 mins til your turn.",4
"I don't get it... I just don't get it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Why do people love Daikokuya so much? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was just blahhhhh to me.I'd give it a 3.5 for the tonkotsu kotteri ramen and a 2 for the salmon bowl combo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The fish was cut poorly and had a hint of sour to taste. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_With the kotteri ramen, it was very fattening which is expected considering it's backfat, but the broth itself was bland and in my opinion too much green onions (I didn't know that was possible until Daikokuya). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The meat and soysauce egg were also nothing special.The wait was really long, which I don't get either--I'm not sure what I'm missing...why do people like this place so much? lol, we ended up having to wait 45 minutes to get seated on a week night dinner. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When seated, the table was sticky and not well wiped. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The service was fast though, but everything was just so cramped and restrooms were not well kept.In terms of price, it ended up being under $20 for a combo ramen, which is reasonable. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If I come back, I'll get the tonkatsu bowls because I've heard good things about that...Considering the wait time, line, and last experience, I won't go out of my way for it though.Tip: Go to Shin Sen Gumi the block over instead or Santouka at Mitsuwa.",3
Long wait. You have to have your entire party in order to be seated. Taste wise it's good ramen nothing extraordinary. The egg was placed a little too early so it was well done by the time you eat it.Takoyaki was 7/10. Nice texture. Worth the hype? Not really.,3
"I should preface this with including that I'm not much of a ramen snob. But, I have been to several line-out-the-door Ramon places throughout LA and the Bay Area and this has been my favorite. Affordable prices, kind service, and great tasting ramen. I ordered the original Daikokuya ramen, my friend got the spicy. Both awesome. A friend and I went on a Wednesday night, and the wait was only about 35 min. I'm sure it's much crazier in the weekends. Parking seems to be rough, I lucked out and found street parking but it was still $4/hour.",4
"A random trip north landed us in Little Tokyo around 9am, and we unintentionally parked right in front of Daikokuya, but didn't notice, because we were in search for a restroom. The more we walked around Little Tokyo, the more our stomachs started to growl. One cannot fully explore on an empty belly! All signs pointed to Daikokuya after a quick search for ramen shops, especially when we saw the line forming outside at 10:53am. OH! BEFORE I CONTINUE! IT'S CASH ONLY!! You can run across the street to Chase, or withdraw money from an ATM at Daikokuya.Where was I? Oh yeah, ramen! We got an order of takoyaki and the original Daikokuya Ramen. Our takoyaki was on point. Be careful when eating it, because it could be super hot inside! The ramen was deeeelicious; noodles and egg were cooked perfectly, and the broth was flavorful and rich. They also garnished the ramen with plenty of scallions. I liked using copious amounts of their crushed garlic. Mmmmmmmmmm. Quick and friendly service. Small space with limited seating, so I would really encourage coming as soon as Daikokuya opens, or earlier, to get decent parking!",5
"Favorite ramen place! Pork is super tender, eggs are delicious and the broth is perfect. Eat it with some fried rice! Lines are long but Worth the wait!",4
"Boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday night. The wait was about an hour. As suggested, I got the Daikoku ramen with kotteri flavor. Was it good? Yes. Was it worth the wait? Not really. Place was overhyped. I don't know, I just expected something more, but it tasted like your typical ramen.",5
"Best ramen I've had in a while, they keep it simple, waited about 45 min on a saturday, worth it. Go!",3
"Oh my gooodddOH MY GODDDDI am on a low carb diet so it is such a STRUGGLE for me to resist ramen and rice but I would use all my cheat days on Daikokuya.I wasn't really down for ramen that day, so I split a combo with a friend. She got the ramen w/ kotteri broth. I tried some of it and it was pretty good! I wouldn't say AMAZING, but still better than average I guess.My meal, on the other hand, was a bowl of rice and some slices of salmon sashimi. The salmon was pretty good, pretty normal. BUT. THE RICE. DANG. IDK what kind of rice they use but it's SO GOOD????? I made all my friends try it and they even agreed that they must have prepared it in some special way? Or maybe it's the grain, I'm not sure.. But it just tastes SO GOOD!!! Take it from an ex-everyday rice eater. So good.The wait wasn't too bad. I had just come back from AX with my friends (lol) so it was in the afternoon. We had expected a long wait, but luckily we were seated within 10 minutes! Overall, a good experience!HONESTLY I would go back just for the rice...",5
"Pros: Awesome ramen. I don't know what authentic ramen is but if I were to imagine what it should taste and look like, it would be like the ramen here. It's delicious and once you're seated the food comes out quick. It's one of those places where if you don't like the ramen you're not going to say anything because you know it probably means there's something wrong with you. The environment feels like a local hole in the wall spot in a different country. Cons: No substitutions which can be frustrating if you don't eat pork or have an egg allergy (noodles have egg). The place is really small so there's always a line. A giant line.",4
"This place is amazing and would come back again. The food is great and the workers are nice and get what you need immediately. However the place is really small, but kind of feels like a traditional Japanese restaurant. I got the daikoku ramen and shared some takoyaki's with a friend. My friend got the spicy miso ramen as well. On to the food, this is by far one of the best Japanese ramen I've had in a very long time. If you're looking for a place to have a 30min sit and dine meal, a quick in and out, come here. The wait isn't too long because people tend to eat within 15-20 min and the wait for the food to come out is a fair 10min. I definitely will be back.",5
"My favorite ramen hands down!!!This place is my fav, too bad it's too far from me.Not sure if I'm biased, but this location has better ramen than any other daikokuya.This place can get really packed at night so be prepare to wait since the inside is not big also.",5
"Avid ramen eater. Definitely hit the spot, one of the best spots in little Tokyo! Gyoza as well wasn't generic. Was great with their house special and Sapporo.",5
"I live in Northern California and after coming here once, I have serious cravings for ramen as good as this! Too bad I live over 300 miles away... Anyways, this place has become a mandatory pit stop location for me for the next time I'm in the area!!The wait was long but food definitely made up for it. ^_^I ordered the classic Daikokuya ramen combo with the beef bowl. Throw in some of the garlic purÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©e they set aside on your table and the ramen is P-E-R-F-E-C-T. The cha siu has the perfect amount of fat to meat ratio and it just melts in your mouth. The egg I got was cooked just a liiittle more than I liked but it's okay because I drowned it in more broth!!Portions are huge and price is reasonable. Couldn't ask for anything better! Being accustomed to smaller size ramen portions back in NorCal, I was definitely not prepared to be served this ginormous bowl of delicious goodness and as much as I wanted to finish it, I could not. (I was so sad)Service was great also, waters were never empty! I had a great experience, and left a happy camper. (And probably a couple pounds heavier lol)",5
"Came here on a Friday night around 6:50 and waited for about an hour (walked around at the little Tokyo village across the street to kill some time).We sat down and server took out orders. I think the best way to experience any restaurant is if they offer a combo, order it so you can taste other dishes. I've been here before and love their fried rice so I got the ramen combo with small rice. For an extra ~$3, you get a salad with miso dressing and their fried rice. Love the rice so much I considered ordering it as an entree but decided I had to get ramen since I was there.The ramen is flavorful but not salty, and the noodles were firm, but not hard. I thought you get half an egg, but here you get a whole egg. I would suggest breaking the egg in half so you get kind of the soft yolk. The fried rice is soooo delicious. I don't know if they put like extra oil or butter or bacon grease or whatever, but it is never dry and so flavorful. I love that they shred the meat and that there aren't any hard chunks of meat in it. So good, even heated up the next day.Bang for your buck: go combo. Finish the salad and ramen, and being that rice home if you can't finish. It would be great for lunch at work or school the next day. CASH ONLY. Which is a bummer! But there is an atm in the back of the restaurant that charges $1.50 to withdraw money. I did see a sign from the little Japanese store next door that lets you get cash back. HOWEVER, you have to spend $5 dollars in order to get cash back. So I guess you can pay the $1.50 fee or buy $5 worth of Japanese snacks and get cash. Or do yourself a favor and carry cash.",5
"After so many years of wanting to try this place I finally got my chance, and my verdict is...just OK. With its legendary reputation, my expectations may have been a little too high, but aren't legendary reputations based on something? My friends and I got there right before 6 so we didn't have to wait too long, but the line sure got long quick. It was also a Friday, which I'm sure is one of the popular nights. Once inside, I took in its plain, aging decor--definitely nothing to write home about, but I was there for the food, not ambiance.Since I was pretty hungry I opted for their combo of Daikokuya ramen and a small bowl of Ikura Gohan (salmon roe over rice)--$15.95 as of this writing, also accompanied by a small salad. I was pretty impressed by their portions, that's for sure! The ramen was much larger than I was anticipating, and their side portion of the Ikura Gohan was pretty generous as well. I think what I liked most about their ramen were the noodles: curly noodles perfectly al dente with a chewy bite that I love! The broth was pretty good as well, but I thought the pork slices were thin and not very tender. What really disappointed me though was the rice in the Ikura Gohan--it was not very fresh, with slightly crusty parts. The salmon roe was fine, but I was kind of shocked they'd serve it over substandard rice, hmmph. I've had way better Ikura Gohan at Santouka, which is inside a supermarket. The service was also just OK, the wait staff so harried there's no time/inclination for niceties, apparently. I was afraid to try the bathroom after reading Roy B's review, but it was all right, nothing too scary. Overall, the ramen was satisfactory and I'm glad I got to try it, but there are so many other good ramen places I don't see myself eager to come back any time soon.",3
I hate your long lines. Always expect to wait at least 1-2 hours. My only reason why I knocked off a star.Food is always good here. The pork broth is very flavorful and heavy. Remember to ask for the spicy chilli oil and the ginger/garlic is a must have. I always order the combination but end up taking the ramen home because it's a lot of food!,4
"I had the original ramen after waiting for 30mins on Monday at 3pm. I thought the noodle was good but not worth the hype. Now I had ramen in Tokyo and ippudo in NYC before, so daikokuya was billed to me as the same quality as those two but it didn't come close. The price was reasonable but save yourself the hassle and possibly money by getting equivalent quality ramen at santuoka in Mitsuwa.",3
"Was there on a business trip and visited this place by accident. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Saw some people lining up outside so decided to line up with the people. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Did not realize what this place was until I got inside the small, very cram waiting area. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Waited about 30mins to be seated at a table and it just open. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ordered the Diakoku ramen, and it was heaven. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was one of the best ramen I had so far. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I always see Naruto eating ramen after he goes on a mission and did not understand why he always eats it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Now, man, I will surely go back to this place just for the ramen.Don't understand why they yell everything though.",5
"We were looking for a good ramen place in LA while on vacation, and after lots and lots of googling, Yelping, etc.., we decided we wanted to try out this place. First of all, the restaurant is tiny. It was extremely hot inside, and didn't help that we were seated on the side in front of where they keep the broths (I think). Would like to sit in the booth next time. Second, it seems there is always a wait here! We went quite early for dinner (around 5?) and we still had to wait a good 30-45min for a table. We didn't mind so much, because we just left and walked around Little Tokyo and came back just in time. I was feeling a bit iffy about the place as I went to the bathroom to wash my hands because it just looked so old and like a hole in a wall.. But I was pleasantly surprised with the ramen!We ordered the Daikoku ramen and the Spicy Miso! Both were so good! The broth was extremely flavourful and tons of noodles. Seriously for like 10$ per person? Sooo good. Some things to remember when you visit this place is that it is CASH ONLY. Also, expect a wait. There seems to be multiple locations around LA, but I can only speak for this one in Little Tokyo. They are opened until midnight (mon-thurs), 1am (fri-sat) and 11pm (sun) which I think is amazing. Now I can only hope for something as good as this place in my city one day!",5
"Ordered the Daikoku ramen with kotteri (enriched fatty flavor).... didn't find it salty at all (compared with most ramen joints). The ramen was very rich &amp; flavorful, it definitely hit the spot! Their salad dressing was also very tasty. My only gripe about this place was seating area is too confined inside. Expect a 2-hour wait if you can stand it!!!Overall rating:Food: 5 starsPlace: 2 stars due to confined space and looooooong wait!!!",3
"My friends and I decided to come here around 4:50pm. Much to our surprise, there was no wait! We ordered the daikoku ramen with the ""kottori(?)"" broth, gyoza, and a side order of the fried rice. The fried rice was SO GOOD! It was so flavorful and was definitely the best fried rice I ever had. Our ramen was delicious! My friend was the one who ordered it kottori style, and the broth was so flavorful. I personally would not get it kottori style, because it is so rich and fatty.The gyoza my friend ordered was served like a pancake. It was very crispy, and he liked it. A warning: if you are not extremely hungry, I wouldn't get the large size. The portions are very large even for the regular size.Would definitely come back when down in SoCal, but would just get the ramen and not the combo meal. The salad that comes with the combo meal is good too!",5
"The restaurant is really tiny. We came on a weekday and we did not have to wait to be seated because we chose to sit at the bar. If we wanted to sit at a regular table or booth, we would have had to wait to be seated. There was a lot of people when we got there. The area we sat at was kind of smelly. It smelled a little funky. Like wet cloth and dirty dishes. Service was good. They brought out our food really quick after we ordered. Items ordered:Daikoku ramen - recommend ordering. Wasn't too salty and doesn't have that extra oily feeling to the ramen. Fried rice - was a little burnt but overall taste was good. Spicy tuna sushi - goodNo parking on site. You'd have to park at a structure around the block.",4
"My mouth is just watering thinking about this ramen. The texture of the noodle is firm, the spicy miso broth is delicious, but be prepared! The soup is overall bold with flavor and it's a heavy meal. I love a good ramen, and this place did not disappoint! The wait was long for us as it was a Saturday night, but it did satisfy our craving. This place would be perfect for a group setting or after a club crawl. Seriously, I felt like the broth could cure any future hangovers or viruses ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_it's CASH ONLY so be prepared with the guap.",4
"They don't have any vegetarian options and all their ramen has a pork broth, and they have ridiculous waiting times even on a weekday! All my vegetarian fellas, please avoid!",1
One of my favorite ramen spots and worth the 45 minute drive. Affordable and a very generous serving of food.Bring cash!,5
Yum!!! So good. Wait was not too long for a Thursday dinner. Would definitely return.,4
"Guess who's back. Back again. I am back. For ramen. Daiko-f*ckin-kuya, I have returned to your sweet sweet seat (at the bar). I've been thinking about you for the last 2 years and even though I had an early dinner today I had to return for 2nd dinner. Second dinner, you ask? Yep. You read it. Hobbits have 2nd breakfast; I have 2nd dinner. I came, I wrote down my name, and I conquered that delicious, fatty-brothed bowl of noodles. At 10:30pm there were approximately 10 names ahead of me and because I rolled in solo I got seated in 5 minutes. Hazzah! If you haven't gathered from my second updated review of this place that you should eat at this place, well, there might be something off with you. :) Unless you're eating alone (no it's not weird to eat alone), be prepared to wait. I PROMISE you the food is worth the wait. Order the ramen and ask for it kotteri. It was a warm night and I still slurped that hot bowl down. Wash it all down with a Sapporo. Hell, order other the ramen as combo and eat the other delicious foods. You're welcome.",5
"Decided to finally make the drive down to little toyko to do some exploring and to try Daikokuya. Maybe I had too high expectations but it was honestly not that great. The parking around the area was kind of shady but that was expected, I ended up parking in the structure on the corner of central, I believe it was the strip mall structure and walked over. I was expecting a long wait but it was only about 30 minutes which was really good considering it was a friday night. But keep in mind the weather had been a little hot during the time I came.The inside of the shop was pretty small and seeing their amount of popularity they could at least install some air conditioning or at least some fans to cool the place down a little. I think the bowls were reasonable sized and priced. The ramen was just okay. The noodles were just the right amount of firmness that i liked and all the toppings were good.To be honest I probably would not make the drive out here again for Daikokuya because there are so many better places to get ramen in the OC area. And this place is a little overhyped.",3
Ramen was really good. Savory rich broth that is not overdone (not too rich or salty). Homemade gyoza was also very tasty. No complaints on the food at all.,4
Flavorful and authentic tasting Daikokuya ramen! The combination ramen + rice bowl is a bang for your buck. The beef and pork in the beef bowl and pork bowl were both tender. We also ordered the spicy tuna roll and we loved it! It was our first time here. We came in at around 6pm and there was a short wait. Come here a little later and you'd be waiting in line. It's all worth it! :),4
"My o my. 6000+ reviews at 4stars can't be wrong. Loved it. Should be 5stars. But it's ok. The floor was super slippery. But at least you're warned they are. Fast friendly service and some of best ramen outside Japan. Loved their thin sliced salmon sashimi. Paid parking. In heart of Little Tokyo. Does get crowded. Seating for less than 100, but that's to make sure quality and service isn't compromised.",5
"What can I say that everyone else hasn't already said? Brace yourself for a long wait, but it's worth it in the end. The ramen is delicious and rich, the shredded pork bowl makes my mouth water even now, and you can forgo the salad unless you really like pretending that dressing-drenched soggy veggies are somehow helping you maintain your diet. Whatever. Just go straight for the bowl. Be warned: if you're not accustomed to the richness of the broth (and this is a nice way of saying it's fatty and satisfying in the way grandma's pie is), you might get a little queasy eating the whole thing. Never fear, young grasshopper: you'll be a real man one day! Keep at it, son. Keep at it.",5
"I'm not a hugeee fan of ramen at all, however when it comes to Daikokuya this is my ONLY exception. I much rather wait and pay for this than Shin Sen Gumi. The wait is horrendous, but if you're a huge ramen fan...imig it's worth it? LOL But no, i wouldn't wait for it only because I'm like whatever's with ramen. Be very prepared for the hour wait. Another great thing is they close super late!",4
Been to both of their shops in Monterey Park and Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Both did not disappoint. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The service was prompt. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Monterey Park location is a tag smaller then Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Good ramen is just good ramen doesn't matter where you go and this is THE place.,5
"A solid ramen place. I had the standard ramen, which was a reasonable $9.50. It had a respectable amount of meat, and I was happy with the two eggs. Broth was pretty flavorful too. A good place to fill up for around $10. I would certainly come here often if I lived or worked nearby.",4
"The PINKS of Ramen...the busiest spot in Little Tokyo is also a massive waste of time and tastebuds.A long time ago, they actually had great food at a great price. Who knows what happened but the broth and ingredients are not what they were. And I can taste the bloody CHLORINE. Jesus - kids - go somewhere else. You are not getting anything so-called ""authentic"" here.Strongly suggest going to Mr. Ramen for his broth (and order lots of extra ingredients) or Kouraku for everything else. A restaurant is not good because there is a line. In LA, there is a line because there is a line! -----What happened to you, Daikokuya???A long time ago, this was one of the best restaurants in Little Tokyo. From their amazing Ramen with a rich, delicious broth to their Chinese-influenced side dishes like Fried Rice, Gyoza...even their Chicken Teriyaki was the best in Little Tokyo...There was always a wait...and clientele was a mix of locals, Japanese and noodle tourists...But now...the wait time is double, triple what it was. Mostly jam packed with tourists a and momos from the West Side who need to taste ""authentic"" Japanese food. And that's the shocker because the broth is like a watered down version of what it was, as are the ingredients...even the amount of noodles is different. Pork was kind of slimey...ramen was a little warm and flavor was totally off...miso soup tasted like chlorine...side dish of salmon on rice was also very bad...pork cutlet was rubbery...Wow. What a sad thing to see. This was one of the coolest, best spots for late night food. Of course, you can see no Japanese chefs cooking anymore...not a racial thing but man, Ramen and this kind of comfort food takes years to perfect...you can't put amateur people in there and expect a good result. Prices were also higher...I believe...This is what happens when a place gets too popular. Owners know they can do what they like and people will still go. Emperor's New Clothes.",2
"Los Angeles ramen receives so much hype, the craze reaches the east coast. I'm glad I finally got to experience ramen here, especially at Daikokuya.The wait was ridiculous; we were standing outside for about an hour. However, the allure of ramen and the way the other customers were slurping at their bowls kept us waiting. Besides, we knew what to expect from Daikokuya. Don't come here and not expect to wait!My sister ordered the Daikokuya ramen and I got the spicy miso ramen with the intention of sharing both bowls between the two of us. My sister didn't even see it coming. After the first sip of spicy broth, I was stuck on automatic-eating-mode and could barely lift my head from my meal. The broth is flavorful and spicy in a way that doesn't make you feel like your tongue is falling off. The noodles were well-cooked and given in huge portions.My two friends and my boyfriend got rice bowls and I unfortunately focused a little too much on my own ramen to try their dishes, but they really enjoyed their meals.",2
"This is hands down the best ramen place I've been to and I would say it lives up to all the hype around it. I ordered the daikoku ramen with the koterri (which means they add back fat to the ramen to make it more rich). It was fantastic and only came out to be around $10. The meat was tender the broth was really flavorful and the egg was cooked so that the yolk was just a bit soft (so basically perfect).Some downsides:1. Cash only, so bring cash2. The wait was pretty long. I was with a group of 5 and it took us about an hour to be seated but we just went to a nearby bar for a couple drinks until it was time. If you have some time its a great area to wander and explore. You really can't expect anything else on a weekend night for a place this good.",4
Today my friend and I wanted some Ramen and decided to get cold Ramen instead of the traditional hot Ramen. It was the best decision we had made. The presentation was excellent and the taste was amazing. I though Korean Cold noodles was good but man this Japanese cold noodles are my new favorite place. They have two flavor but make sure you ask for sesame sauce not soy sauce. This is definitely a MUST TRY dish.,5
"Daikokuya. I was only in LA for a weekend, and I spent two hours of that time waiting in line hoping my name would be called off the list sooner than later to be seated for a bowl of ramen.After hungrily waiting, we were finally seated, and the service was quick and efficient, and the food came out so fast!The ramen. I may have only had the bowl once, but it is something I can't forget. The noodles were made to perfection, not soggy, but not crunchy. And the broth, it had this delicious savory and creamy taste that was so smooth to slurp with each spoonful. Some ramen broths have the tendency to leave behind a residual salty taste on the tongue, but not this one.Was it worth the two hour wait? Probably. Would I wait two hours again? Maybe after I've tried a few other food places the next time I'm in LA.",4
"Hands down the best ramen I've ever had.The Daikoku ramen with the kotteri broth is phenomenal. The broth is both flavorful and savory. It's a must try for ramen fanatics.There most likely will be a line, but rest assured, it is worth the wait.Also from what I can remember it's cash only.",5
"I love Japanese food very much.This was the first time to eat Japanese food in LA last weekend.I enjoyed Ramen, Salmon sashimi and Gyoza with my friends. I love Ramen here because the pork and boil egg are soft and yummy!!!Unfortunately, I waited for 40 minutes. So I went shopping in Little Tokyo village.This was my good time.",4
"We got here at an off time, so we only waited about 15 minutes. The ramen was very good, but I do wish there were more a few more options. The pork was a little bit fattier than I would've liked it, but it was very tasty once you got past the texture. The sliced pork appetizer was delicious, as was the gyoza. The tsukemono was interesting and very aesthetically pleasing. I don't know if I'd wait 2 or more hours for this place, but I'm happy we were able to check it out while in LA.The place was very clean and orderly and the waitstaff was efficient and attentive.",4
"I was dying in the summer heat to get a table at Daikokuya! It was one of those day when you just sweat from standing outside. My friends and I probably waited around an hour to an hour and a half before we got seated. Fortunately, the eating experience was decent. The servers are really kind, but it took the chefs SO LONG to get the food to us. I think we waited another 20-30 minutes for food. It was better than sitting outside, but everyone was HUNGRY, turning into HANGRY (Not really! We just wanted our food!). I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen and was very satisfied with the level of quality in the broth, noodles, and meat. On top of that, the ramen is only $9.50 per regular bowl, which is $1-3 dollars less than what you tend to find in Northern California (Come on NorCal...). I do regret not getting the extra fat flavoring for the ramen broth because although the ramen was good, there wasn't something that made me go WOW OK I SEE THE HYPE. However, I wouldn't mind coming back here to wait in line again and order more!Also, I noticed my friend didn't really like his cold soup ramen. I haven't personally tried it, but if it's your first time here, stick with the traditional ramen!",4
"Only giving this a one because our food came fast once we were seated. Been wanting to try this place since I always hear about it. Judging by the long line I usually see, I put this place so high on a pedestal. When we got there no one told us where to sign or were even greeted. I walked in the whole way until I saw a clipboard on a chair. The wait was not so bad for a Saturday night. Approximately 30 minutes. The menu doesn't have much on it, literally. So I ordered spicy miso ramen since I love spicy food, but boy is this way far from being spicy. Over all the noodles were great, but the soup on its own lacks flavor. There is nothing special about it. I've had better ramen when I eat the 59cents bowl noodles from my local bargain. The worst part about this experience was that I didn't bother to finish eating my soup so once I paid I wanted to leave. The waitress corners me in demanding for her tip!I'm not big on tipping which is one of my pet peeves so to have her literally box me in pointing at the suggested tip made me furious. What service did she provide me? She took my order ""mentally"" then came back after and confirmed my order meanwhile different people gave me my food and drink! THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH THE HYPE. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN. SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME FROM THIS FLAVORLESS PLACE!",1
"The newly featured SPICY MISO RAMEN is COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY PERFECT.*closes eyes and licks lips as she reminisces the amazingly juicy pork belly slices, the incredibly al dente ramen noodles, the perfectly gooey soft boiled egg yolk, and the MOST BOMB ASS SPICY MISO BROTH EVER...*""Uh, Shelley, you having a wet dream? That's nasty. Dafuq.""""Oh, sorry.""*wipes off drool and inserts look of disapproval*Congratulations, the posting of this five-star review just added another 10 minutes to your already ridiculous wait. You're welcome!",5
"So this is the first time trying legitimate ramen for me, and I can see what the hype is all about. The flavors are so well constructed and delicious. Definitely recommend. It can get a bit hectic inside but I think that's the whole experience of it, in a sense.",5
"My wife and I were trying get a table at Daikokuya in Monterey Park was busy and a long wait and the restaurant was small. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ My wife and I went Little Tokyo to shop around after we finished shopping, we were hungry I told my let's go to Daikokuya just across the street from Japanese Village. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ We walk across the street and head it to Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ We were surprise the wait, people waiting outside the restaurant waiting for a table. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My biggest surprise was the restaurant it was small like the one in Monterey Park. My wife put my name on the waiting list and waited for our turn it took at less an hour but worth the wait to eat one the best place for ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My wife and I order the tonkoku ramen one of their popular ramen and shrimp tempura and California roll.. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The waitress brought us their home salad it was really good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Then ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_waiter brought us our ramen noodle bowls. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ One taste of the both was delicious it wasn't salty it was perfect harmony on my taste buds. My wife enjoy her ramen bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The shrimp tempura was really good including the vegetables tempura. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The sauce come with the tempura was delicious when you dip the tempura in the sauce.. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The California roll were really good my wife and I enjoy it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall Daikokuya is one the best place ramen but the wait is worth it.",5
"We've been in Little Tokyo several times and I recall the locals told us to go to the other place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Figure with such good review we should try while we're here. Service, whoa, didn't realize Japanese service could be this rude! I've visited Japan a number of times and never encountered anything like this. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Also they let the person behind us cut inline to an open table so we ended up waiting...disappointed by this and the ruse customer.Ramen wise, typical,nothing extraordinary to want to return to. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We had better back at home in TX and WA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was good, maybe it's the service that ruin our taste bud!",2
"My tour of Little Tokyo, continued. :) I was by myself and got there around 6, so was seated at the bar within 5 minutes. TBH the kotteri style kind of freaked me out, so I went with the spicy miso ramen. So delicious - I finished the whole thing! The flavor of the broth was perfect and the pork was so tender. It made my belly so happy!",4
"Best ramen on the West Coast!! I cannot stress how good this place is. I've frequented this place every time I go back to Los Angeles. The ramen tastes authentic and having been to Japan, the atmosphere, combined with the way they prepare and serve food, feels like I'm actually in a ramen joint in Tokyo. I get their house speciality, Daikoku Ramen and it never disappoints.A few things, as others have probably mentioned, this location only takes cash so do bring bills with you before you come in. Also, they don't do reservations, as far as I understand. You arrive and sign in and based on available seating and time, you and your party will be seated accordingly.Wait times for dinner can be up to an hour or two so do prepare to wait. I've mostly gone here during dinner but last time I was here I came right when it opened (11AM) and did not have trouble getting a seat.I haven't been to their other locations but I do plan to visit eventually. The Little Tokyo location is just so convenient for me.Will I come back? Definitely :)",5
"We were very lucky in getting a spot before rush hour around 12PM because that line was looooong. It's definitely a small spot with limited tables and bar seating. It reminds of the ramen shop in Naruto somewhat. As first timers here and with LA's summer time weather, we definitely had a great time here with good ramen and a beer to pair with it too. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ordered one regular daikokuya ramen and the kotteri option. Needless to say great noodles, egg, and garnish! The broth for the regular is definitely less fattier and less creamier than the kotteri option(uses back fat). I'd probably go back for the kotteri if anything because it's ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_yummier and definitely don't mind being a little less healthy here and there! Cash only and parking is either street parking or parking lots for $8-10 whole day**",5
"At Daikokuya Ramen, $10 gets you one of the best ramen bowls you will eat outside of Japan. It's one of many small shops in the Little Tokyo district, but it's easy to find. It's the place with about 2 dozen people waiting outside.My favorite style is the house specialty - pork bone broth - referred to as tonkotsu. Ask for it koterri style and your bowl will be served with meat fat stirred into the broth making for for a extra rich, extra savory bowl of Ramen. Yum yum! Because of its reasonable prices, this place is always mobbed by foodies. So there there is always a significant wait to be seated. This problem is compounded by the fact that most people don't understand that Ramen is supposed to be eaten FAST. The longer your bowl sits there, the noodles become soggy, and your broth becomes lukewarm. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's a free country, but if you eat ramen slow, you're messing up. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Because parking is a hazard in this part of town, I recommend this place if you already happen to be in the area (there are awesome museums nearby) and you're willing to wait for a bowl of ramen you won't soon forget.",4
"Yes, it is good, but it is not so that I am willing to stand online for 30 mins for it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you go to Mitsuwa market placeeatery, there is always a Ramen place with a curry placenext to each other. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Try that. Price is about the same,but you save 15% tips! Typically, the wait is 5 mins insteadof 30 mins. Get a curry chicken dish and a bowl of ramento share with a friend, you will be happy!",2
"Heard this place was super popular so we came on a weekday and stood in line before it even opened. We were first in line and after the restaurant opened, the place filled up pretty quickly. The place is small so be prepared to wait in line. We ordered their popular ramen and spicy miso ramen. I thought the portions were huge because I couldn't finish mine.Both broths were very creamy, flavourful, and not too salty. The noodle was the right consistency as in not too hard or too soft. There were plenty of noodles too. I didn't think the spicy miso ramen was spicy at all so I threw in some red peppers in there.Overall, I enjoyed the ramen here and highly recommend coming here for food.",5
"Def my fave spot for ramen in Little Tokyo. For $9.50 you can get the Daikoku Ramen, which includes pork, egg, and toppings. LOTS of green onions. Like you're gonna get a 1/2 cup of scallions, son. Kotteri style is heavier and porkier and what I usually get when I come here. If you're gonna have pork broth, why half ass it? The chashu pork itself itself isn't phenomenal but it's better than Orochon's (not saying much). Honestly I'd skip eating it altogether. You don't need it. The noodles are firm and delicious in the fatty broth, dotted with milky pork fat globules. The egg is nice and the bean sprouts fine. Yes, yes, all very good.Soooo, the thing about Daikokuya is there's usually a line outside. On weekdays go early like 11:00 or 11:30am at the very latest. Write your name on the clipboard and keep track of what # you are. There are only 40-something seats, tops, so be prepared to wait. If you can't hack it, go next door to Marugame Monzo as soon as they open at 11:30am. You'll probably be able to snag a seat. It's not ramen but, oh no, you'll have to eat uni udon instead. #firstworldproblemsAs for parking, if you can't snag a meter, park at the Miyako Hotel valet across the street. It's like $6 and cheaper than the $10-ish garage across from the subpar ramen joint Shin-Shen-Gumi.",4
Love the ramen so much that I wish they had more for me to eat! I even like how crowded and hectic the place feels. Nom nom nom!! I wish they had take out so I could order it more often.,5
"This definitely one of my favorite Ramen spots, but the crazy long wait is a little insane. If you want to eat here, get here an hour before you become a crazed starving animal.I usually get their Tonkatsu Ramen, since I love the richness of the broth. The noodles are always cooked to perfection. I tried the Spicy Miso Ramen but found it to be a little too salty for me and not at all spicy. I really love their Salad and Takoyaki as well.",4
"This place was just the greatest little gem in Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait was a bit long, but well worth it. I recommend the spicy ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their sushi was pretty good too. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My Husband, and I came here for a date and we were greeted by the best wait staff in Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_What an amazing experience to have traditional ramen.",4
"Best ramen in LA because of a few things:1. Conveniently located right next to the Little Tokyo plaza, so your one hour wait won't seem that long!2. The shop is on the smaller side, but it definitely feels more homey. They even set aside two decent sized areas inside for you to wait if you don't want to go exploring.3. Bowls of ramen are HUGE. Food coma afterwards? No problem.4. Noodles, broth, egg, and pieces of meat were all A+. It's hard to find ramen that has top notch quality for all of these ingredients.5. Shredded Pork Bowl is AMAZING. I mean, seriously. Daikokuya is a ramen shop, but their rice dish is a party in your mouth? Sold.Bowls of ramen are around $10. Combinations (include a bowl or ramen with a small rice bowl) are around $13-15. CASH ONLY!",5
"Always crowded. Always a wait. Always good. I have moved on from ramen lately. I used to eat ramen all the time but now my muffin top belly is telling me to stop. Instead, I go next door to Marugame Monzo - I know, its just as bad haha. Anyway, food here is really good. I have always loved their broth and their pork bowl. They flavors are just amazing. Service is pretty fast. Last time I came it was cash only!",4
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place.With 6000+ reviews, I doubt I can offer a unique perspective.Get the kotteri. Get the large cause the small size will barely fill you up. Soup is very rich. The AC barely works so you're going to sweat balls if you going during a summer day. Sasuage and Gyoza is good.",4
"There are a ton of people in front of Daikokuya allll the time, especially weekends. However, if you have a small party, bar seating moves pretty fast. And If you are super hungry, probably won't live to see the day they call your name. Service is great! Food comes out very fast. It's on the larger portion side, also offer combo where you can order ramen, a rice dish also comes with salad which is really delish!! Definitely bring your appetite. We ordered their signature Daikoku ramen, spicy miso ramen with shredded pork rice and salad. Well flavored, spicy miso is not very spicy at all. Pork slices inside the ramen melts in your mouth! Nice broth not too salty, slightly oily, but all ramen are kinda like that. Shredded pork with rice was very soft too! But a little bit salty due to the teriyaki sauce. With what we ordered its about $30 plus tips. Make sure you bring cash!!! This place is cash only, they have a sign up at every table.",4
"So finally, here's my first taste of ""authentic"" ramen. I will say, it was damn tasty. The hour wait wasn't fantastic, but we made the most of it at nearby Tokyo plaza. The 6 of us all opted for the combo route, I chose the tempura. The place is small and narrow, but no matter, the food is what counts! Hot bowls of rich pork-y broth, chewy noodles, fatty meat... mmmmmmmI'm glad I finally have something to compare the latest Houston offerings to, and hopefully they'll start being on par with this. Hey, a girl can dream.",4
"The mob gathers outside restlessly, constantly probing and pushing to get just a glimpse of their name on the clipboard. 10 parties ahead of me? I can wait. One minute later. Still 10 parties ahead of me?! What the @$&amp;? I have never seen any ramen shop with a wait as long as Daikokuya. Ironic as ramen is supposedly ""fast food"" where you go in, eat fast, pay and leave. Anyhow, the wait can be anywhere between 30-90 minutes on any given day/hour so plan for that. If you manage to survive the wait, then you're golden... Unless you forgot to bring cash, cause this place is cash only. Bring cash for goodness sake.Onto the food. Get the ramen duh. Daikoku ramen is their classic, they also offer spicy miso and other options which are also good. I actually also like their rice bowls too, ramen shops tend to make good rice dishes too for some reason. All in all, the food is solid and the prices are decent but I certainly would argue the wait is not worth it if it's more than an hour. But hey, you can walk around Little Tokyo if the wait is truly that long.",4
"This is one of my favorite ramen places ever! My friend and I wanted to get ramen somewhere in Little Tokyo and this was the place that Yelp pulled up. Parking is a bit difficult on a busy day, since it is mainly street (coins) parking. I was here on a Saturday afternoon, and the wait was about 30-40mins for a table for 2. You can put your name on the list and stroll around the Japanese shops nearby or in the plaza. It is very easy to kill time here. Once it was almost our turn, we waited inside in the seating area, which was very crowded and small. Once seated in a booth, the service was very fast. It was a bit awkward though, because everyone waiting is basically watching you eat as they are waiting..haha! We ordered the spicy ramen and special: Daikokuya ramen, shredded pork with rice, and the salad. We were given the small salad first which needed to get mixed (the dressing was sitting on top). It was good once we mixed the dressing in the salad. The pork was nice as well, but not to die for. The ramen for the both of us was SO GOOD. Both ramens were delicious and I loved everything about it from the piece of pork, to the veggies and to the noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I took my ramen leftovers to go, and they packed it up for me. Great food, would definitely come again!Tips: -Cash only-They don't do to-go-Place your name on the list once you get there!",4
"After years of saying we would pop in we finally popped. Bottom line, the ramen was good but frankly we've had better and at better prices. The funky old time vibe is fun and the service very quick. No real negatives but nothing to justify all the hoopla. Their tsukemono plate was excellent especially the kimchi. The house ramen broth was rich and full flavored but the toppings were stingy and at $11.50 a bowl, the cost exceeded usual ramen prices in Little Tokyo. So...recommend one visit for the experience and fun but maybe not a repeat.",3
"So so good, we had the pork ramen and it was exactly what we hoped for. A thick flavorful broth, and the bowl was a good size portion--not some tiny cute bowl--but a bowl for someone who actually loves ramen lol. We vowed to come back everything we are in LA.",5
"While visiting LA, I figured I had to visit Little Tokyo and enjoy some ramen. I intentionally visited on a weekday lunch hour to avoid the large crowds. This restaurant still had a long line up on a weekday! Also, it seems like the only restaurant with a line up so I had to join the crowds. The wait was 30 minutes. We ordered ramen and gyoza. Food arrived quickly. The ramen was so good! There was one whole soft boiled marinated egg that was perfect. The noodles were chewy and plentiful. The chashu was tender. The broth was flavourful and a touch in the saltier side. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Gyoza was tasty and well seasoned! Overall, one very good meal. My only complaint is the cash only payment option. I think the restaurant is busy enough to take credit cards and pay that little extra transaction fee.",4
Good ramen. Good price. Expect to make lots of line. Not much to chose from but overall a good experience.,4
"This is my favorite ramen place in LA. They cook the broth for 3 days. There's always a long long line so expect it,day or night. It's worth the wait.",5
"Disappointed, it just isn't as good as it use to be. Long wait...food and sevice has gone down.",1
"Got here 10:50am before they open. There was a line already started,I was like wow...really? Its pretty small resturant. Seated after 40mins wait finally our food came. I had really high expectation about this place,because lots of peeps said this place was so good. I ordered ramen combo with pork cutlet. Well, honestly I dont think I will comeback for ramen and wait 40mins. To me it was just same ramen that I tried at other places. Food was ok but wont be back! :) I can find ramen which taste like this in oc area. Im satisfied that At least I tried this place!",4
"No frills ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the wait was pretty long when i went but it was a delicious ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_nothing fancy about it but nothing fancy needed as they get their basic ramen down to an art form. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_nice firm, fresh, and a slight chewiness of the noodles complement a warm and flavorful broth. seasoned just right. with a tender pork and runny egg to complete the meal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I will ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_come back again to eat it when I'm in town.",4
Came here with friends because those comments... Too popular ...not sure people are attracted by its reputation or just come back for its quality . Since I felt that it was around average level after 2hrs waiting. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Friends ordered spicy miso ramen and I did the ikura bowl. Ramen: came out just ramen without any complimentary snacks...Ikura bowl: huge portion of rice and less salmon eggs.. Not too bad but not as expected. Charge for hot tea . Cash only... Will not come back.,3
"5488 reviews..I guess we kind of HAD to try the place. My friends and I were only in LA for a little more than 24 hrs and Daikokuya was on our list of places to eat. It was 1230pm on a Sunday and we were slightly hung over. We made our way from the Westside, through LA traffic to Little Tokyo. As we drove by, there were about 15 people standing on the sidewalk under the hot sun waiting for a table at the restaurant. We parked a good 4 city blocks away and put our name down on the wait list. Luckily, there were a couple stools to sit on inside, where it was cooler. After about 40 minutes, we were seated and placed our orders. We each ordered combinations so we could try more than 1 thing from their menu including 2 Daikoku ramen bowls with the pork cutlet and 1 spicy miso ramen bowl with shredded pork. We also got an order of the takoyaki as an appetizer. The ramen definitely hit the spot and we were so full with leftovers to-go. All in all though, it probably wasn't THE best ramen we've ever had. Coming from the Bay, we had quite a few spots to compare it to. A quote from my boyfriend.. ""I'd probably be okay not coming back."" Still glad we got to try it!",3
"Are you ready to wait in line for this tasty ramen? If you are, make sure you're not starving because it will be a long wait. Luckily we only waited for30 minutes because it was 10:30pm in a Tuesday night. Even that late, there was still a line. I bet it's like 3 hours during the day or dinner time. Food was pretty good. Hunnie and I ordered takoyaki, ramen special, tempura, unagi bowl and chicken karaage. My favorite was the unagi bowl and takoyaki. We have had better ramen before but this was not bad. This place is CASH only so go across the street. There's Citibank and chase or they have an ATM inside too. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Less 2 stars ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_for the Bathroom, kitchen and restaurant floors being dirty. If you serve food, the place has to be clean. But I guess they don't have time to keep up with the cleanliness because it's always packed. Parking could be difficult around . We had to circle like 5 times to find parking. Don't leave anything in your car either.",3
"Being a newbie to Daikokuya I was not sure what to expect. I've had a couple of less than stellar ramen excursions lately but hey I do love me some noodles! Warning this is not a true Ramenya so if looking for multiple ramen choices move on bro. Still this is a solid choice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_This time my partner in crime Dave G and I decided on this place for a pre Laker game meal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_yelp.com/biz_photos/stapÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_ primo meal for premium seating.... yelp.com/biz_photos/stapÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_I should have bought some lotto tickets that day. The stars must have been perfectly aligned because not only did we park right in front we were seated immediately! Both unheard of at this uber-mega-popular spot. With almost 5000 reviews in English and one in Dutch? This is a Yelp darling for sure. We were seated in the tiny corner of the noodle bar. Kind of cramped for two guys our size but it beats waiting. We got a couple of cold Asahi's while we pursed the menu. I should have remembered my bro Cathy S's review as I too was kind of bummed at only having two ramen choices Tonkotsu and Tonkotsu w/Kotteri. Both pork bone based the latter having a heavier pork back fat broth added. Think they also have a spicy miso based ramen but missed it o the menu.So we decided to get the Shredded Pork Bowl Combo yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_topped with green onions and some ginger that came with miso soup, salad, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_to split after a dude next to us recommended it. Nice choice as the pork was very flavorful and tender we both liked it. 4****Stars ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_ yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_Also split some deep fried spicy tuna filled veggies. The tuna had no taste. 1*Staryelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_We both ordered the signature dish Diakokuya Ramen with stingy amounts of green onions, bamboo shoots, sprouts, &amp; tasty pork Unfortunately it was a weak choice for the eyes, however it was a big ass pretty tasty bowl for my tongue and belly! Good broth. I added a little chili dust and it still needed some heat. The cute waitress gave me a bottle of Sriracha sauce. I was disappointed in this move. No real chili paste? How about some pressed garlic? Skimpy on the pork too but as I stirred it up and there it was the OM effing G egg! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A perfect egg. Cut it and yes! yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_ added copious amounts of Sriracha and had me an A-Ok nice bowl of noodles. 3.5****StarsThis was also a first for me. I never seen a white boy cooking in a noodle house. Integration is cool. Weird, but cool!This place is also dirty. Mold on the walls, gross bathrooms, greasy floors. 2**Stars Still it was right on par with some of my favorite taqueria's so I can overlook dirt when taste is involved.The staff is friendly and its a lively place without horrible J-pop music so I can forgo the crud for flavor's sake. Plus if you sit close to the big broth bowls like we did you get a free facial. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_3***Stars overall.Even idiots eat here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Honey boo boo's friends ate ramen here.youtube.com/watch?list=PÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_I might be back.",3
"This place is way overhyped. Waited for an hour at 11pm on a Friday night after driving down from the Bay Area. Tired and starving, I'd think anything would taste AMAZING. I've been here a couple times before so I pretty much knew what to expect.I ordered the daikokuya ramen and it was just a ""meh."" The noodles were cooked perfectly but the broth wasn't too flavorful (I liked how it wasn't overly salty though) and the pork was rough and dry.. wished it was tender. I know I can't compare this to my numerous bowls of ramen from Japan but I can compare it to bowls I've had in the Bay Area and felt like this one was sub par compared to those.Yes, it's supposed to be authentic. You can see them prepare it just like how they do in Japan.. rainboots and tossing water onto the floor and all but the bowl just didn't do it for me. Sorry if I offend any Daikokuya fans.. maybe I just had a bad bowl?",3
"It was definitely worth a trip to go to this restaurant. There's so many people waiting in line. Be prepared to wait an hour or two if you're planning to eat here. Just a heads up. If it's really really hot weather as soon as you walk into the restaurant, it's going to be VERY hot in there cos they're cooking in front. Anyhoo, now to the food part. I ordered Daikokuya ramen, their famous popular ramen, with a combo (that consisted of small pork bowl and salad). They're all pretty good actually. I love how you can add additional toppings into the ramen as you desire. I added corn and nori to enrichen the flavor quality of the ramen. It's a pretty big bowl, not going to lie about that. I almost did not finish but I did! I still think it doesn't compare to Orenchi Ramen in bay area. Idk. I'm guessing because of its eggs and the rich flavor content of the broth. It's still yummy. Very tasty after a long day from the con. HOWEVER, something changed the game. IT'S THE SHREDDED PORK BOWL THAT WON ME OVER. OMG. It was SO SO SO SO GOOOOOD!!! HOLY FRICKIN' MACARONI. IT WAS THE MOST HEAVENLY PORK I EVER TASTED. IT'S DEFINITELY IN PAR WITH MORIMOTO'S KAKUNI :D I CAN'T EXPLAIN... IT'S SO GOOD. OH GOD. I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN A BIG BOWL OF IT INSTEAD OF SMALL! BEST... PORK EVER!",5
"Tried to eat here before but always busy, today made the wait. Yes well worth it, the house ramen very good. Sat down and had our food 10 minutes later. Recommend for anyone coming to little Tokyo.",5
"It was midnight when I came to my favorite ramen place and thought I had met Emma Stone! I actually met Emily dining here with her parents...Emily if you're reading this I am writing this because I regret not asking for your contact to hang out with you one day. You seem like a very sincere person with strong family values, and I'd love to hang out with you someday (I didn't want to ask to hang out in front of the parents because it may have made you feel awkward at the moment). But Emily if you're reading this feel free to reply ! I know I know what you guys might be thinking (this isn't a dating site) but I personally believe that good food can bring good people with similar taste together :)",5
"Cash only, but this shouldn't deter anyone from coming in and trying this awesome place! Yes the lines are daunting so if you have a large party, it's best to split and do parties of 2 to get into the place within 30-45 min. It doesn't matter where on the waiting list you are at, if it ain't a party of 2 you won't be seated right away! A party greater than 2 will leave you waiting from 1hour to 2 hours at the very least! THE SPICY MISO RAMEN IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST THING HERE! Why? It's has that rich creamy broth paired with a soft runny hard boiled egg and melt in your mouth slices of pork yum! Their are different sizes depending how hungry you are. The large bowl is huge! I got the 1/2 bowl and it was enough for me after a long day of site seeing and walking around universal studios. Ambiance wise, the place is really small. Parking wise their are parking garages and two blocks away their is more parking. Truly a must go place if your in little Tokyo! Happy food tripping!",4
"Great ramen spot that tends to get very crowded during peak hours.Rarely do I see this place not full of people. I came here around the afternoon time on a weekday, and it had a short wait. It's a rather small place so I don't recommend going with large groups. Their signature ramen is the Daikoku ramen and I went with their Kotteri flavor. It was so flavorful that I thought it was a bit too much. Service was great as they quick to get my order and I got my food within minutes.The long wait tends to turn me off from coming here first among other ramen places around the area but if I really wanted Daikokuya, I'd prefer going to the Sawtelle one.",4
"I went with a friend around 2pm so there was actually only about a 15 min wait.I really liked the ramen here. The noodles had good texture/hardness (not too soft)I got the spicy miso and my friend got the kotteri original. Both were really good, but I preferred the kotteri. very rich flavor. I would def get it again (even though you feel pretty heavy after)CASH ONLY!!!",4
"Definitely does NOT beat Japan's ramen, but still good. It's a bit overrated though and the lines are always long.",4
"Went here for the first time a few days ago. Me and my friend, being huge ramen enthusiasts with a free night, decided to drive there all the way from south Orange County and arrived at about 12:15am which wasn't a problem with them being open till 1am. There was about a 30 minute wait which was expected at a small shop like this one, But the service and more importantly the ramen was absolutely amazing from the handmade noodles to the Spicy Miso broth to all the amazing toppings. We did order the tonkatsu and a spicy tuna cut roll but definitely not the place for that sort of thing. They're ramen is definitely the star and the other things got in the way more so than anything. But I definitely will be a forever customer!",5
"I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time now and had high hopes given all the hype it has. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I told myself next time I'm down in SoCal, I gotta come here!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But ... disappointment. :/I had the Daikoku Ramen, and it wasn't spectacular or anything, nothing really special. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It wasn't very eyeball pleasing either, and it tasted about the same as it looked... just okay. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The portions are pretty big for what you're paying for, so it's plenty to make you full. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ramen had a nice chewy texture to it and the broth was okay... pork was good, nice big pieces. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I guess my gripe about my bowl of ramen, was that it was very ordinary, so I can't seem to put together the high ratings and ordinariness. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Group think? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Haha.My friend had the Tsukemen with the Kotteri broth, and all it really was, was just wayyyy fattier (as expected). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But, not only was it way fattier, but the broth was also way saltier. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not really my cup of tea. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_:c ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had a taste of my other friend's Spicy Miso ramen, which I would say is probably the better option of the three that I got to sample. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not impressed and probably won't be coming back. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_TIPS: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Came around 2 PM on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait about 30 minutes for a party of 4 (not too bad given this place's popularity), but I got out of the car and waited while my friends drove around looking for parking. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Do that to save yourself some wait time! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There's also an outlet at each of the tables (at least from the 3 that I can see/1 that I sat at ) along the walls behind all the condiments and chopsticks. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can charge your phone! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Haha.",3
"It's sad to say that this very popular place failed to live up to its reputation. My fiancÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©e and I ate here on 03/15/16 and left questioning if we should come back again. First things first: YES, the ramen is one of the best we've ever had and the salad dressing was AMAZING, but I believe a great rating is not just for the food but for the whole dining experience. Now that the positives are out of the way, next comes the negatives:1) I ordered a combo with fried rice and never got my fried rice. I patiently waited and ate my ramen thinking that it will come half-way through my meal and it was still a no show. I asked my original server if they had forgotten and he said it was on its way. I continued to finish my meal and asked again, this time a different server, and she said they will make it ASAP. After my fiancÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©e finished her meal and I continued to wait another ten minutes I finally asked for the check and they still charged me for the combo. I brought up the fact that they failed to bring me the rest of my food after asking twice and they offered to make it still or take it to go. As nice as she was, it was not the kind of dining experience I wanted to have.2) Another concern we had was that my fiancÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©e's food tasted like soap. She ordered a bento box lunch with chicken and steamed rice. It wasn't until later in the meal that she asked if I tasted soap in her dish because she thought it was just her imagination. I tried it and sure enough the rice was wet underneath and tasted like dishwashing liquid.Please understand that we are not that picky but I feel it would be a disservice if I did not note these fixable issues we experienced. I don't really post much on Yelp but I feel for an establishment with such great reviews they do not forget about the small things that can effect a whole dining experience.",2
"If you are not a fan of pork, I wouldn't recommend this place for soups. Unfortunately, the taste of the pork was too strong for me. I felt bad returning the food so I asked the waiter for lemon and sirracha and told her that this was different for me and hopefully that would make it better. Sadly, this didn't do the trick so I had to return my ramen soup. I apologized and told the waiter I could still pay for my food. She replied that they could return it and spoke to her workers in a different language which I couldn't understand. I wasn't offered to order anything else and I felt if I ordered something else they were going to do something with my food.They ended up not charging me. Fyi you have to write your name on the list when you come in. They won't tell you this. This is my honest review. I'm very surprised to find out the many wonderful reviews were misleading.",2
"This is one of my favorite ramen places on the west coast. The tonkotsu ramen is my go-to, and it is done well here. If you aren't crazy hungry, they have a half-size portion option. The line gets quite long, so be sure to have your name written down as soon as you arrive. The staff call out numbers instead of names, so be sure to remember which number you wrote your name next to on the sign in sheet. It is a cash only restaurant.",4
"This place was spectacular! Definitely worth the wait! The place seems to be really popular and it was packed with so many people when we got there! As soon as we sat down, we got greeted really nicely and my boyfriend and I took a second to order but our waiter was really patient and nice and once we ordered our food and received it, we loved it! We got their original ramen and there was two workers who were helping us and they were both so nice! We will definitely be coming here again!",5
This place is not worth the wait or hype. The ramen served at USC fertitta hall basically tastes the same as the one here.,3
"Finally tried Daikokuya! My goodness this place is popular. It's so small on the inside, which means there is always a line outside. I had to wait maybe 20-35 minutes outside, even though it was 11:30pm. Ordered the Daikokuya ramen combo with the shredded pork and rice, and all combos come with a delicious salad. The ramen was extremely rich, and a huge portion! I couldn't even finish it. I loved the noodles, and even though I didn't get the heavier and fattier broth, it was alone heavy enough. The shredded pork was yummy, and went well with the rice. The salad was incredible! Combo all for about $13! Cash only, friendly servers do what they can in such a cramped place packed with people. Parking is sooo difficult.",4
"I was so excited to finally get a chance to taste some authentic ramen, little did I know this would be a night I would never forget. The wait was about 35 minutes which was expected. I ordered a delicious dish and while I was eating it enjoyed it thoroughly. The broth was smooth. It wasn't until the car ride home that the ramen would come back and haunt me. I seriously had to make my husband stop so I can go to the bathroom. You guys I seriously got chorro!! I don't think I will go back as much as it was tasty. The chorro after was definitely not worth it! P.s. My brother got chorro too. :(",2
Best ramen I have ever had hands down!!! My bf and I always come here whenever we can. Yeah we hate the wait but it's worth it though I still wish they could expand and have more seating,5
"Best ramen I've ever had!!! Great portion, delicious broth and the pork was sooo tender. The noodles were nice and thick too. I got the spicy miso and added a bunch of chili oil. DELICIOUS!",5
"We were in the area looking for a good place to sit down and have ramen (in LA weather of course) and saw this place on Yelp - with the sheer amount of reviews we had to give it a try. Luckily, we came 10 minutes before they opened, with a line already but were able to be seated in a booth within the first seating. I see that a lot of the reviews showed that the wait was long, but I think if you come early, you'll get lucky and get seated right away. I ordered the daikokuya ramen - the portion is huge! I should have ordered the half portion that they had, but I was super hungry and ended up finishing the bowl. My fiance ordered the ramen where all the ingredients came on the side (including the noodles) and broth was hot, with a shredded pork bowl and salad. You get a lot of bang for your buck compared to other ramen places. I definitely would recommend this place, but I would also recommend coming earlier to avoid the wait. There are shops across the street to wander while you are waiting, but I would not wait over an hour to eat here.",4
"Went to this place during the spring break this year.The waiting lines are long even in 4pm for dinner, and we even cannot sit in the regular table.The ramen is average, not like what I expect.I will try other entree here next time.",3
"Ramen is decent but poke bowls have lethal amounts of sodium. Service is good, quick, and friendly. If you are eating by yourself, a seat at the counter won't take long.",3
"PARKING: if you're lucky you can get street parking right in front. BUT since I usually don't have coins nor am I ever that lucky LOL I usually park in the office depot plaza! They validate if you get something from office depot, starbucks, or yogurtland!Okay daikokuya is my absolutely favorite ramen spot that I have tried so far at little tokyo. Much better than shin sen gumi and men oh tokushima for sure! I always order the daikoku ramen (pretty much tonkontsu) which is bomb af.....and my boyfriend gets the same but the combo. We've been trying to switch up the side dish and have come to the conclusion that the chicken egg rice bowl is mediocre but the sashimi bowl is SO GOOD. It looks really plain when it comes out.....but the taste....YUM.....shit's got me feelin some typa way LOLAnother thing to keep in mind is that it gets REALLY busy during dinner time. There's ALWAYS a wait (usually almost an hour). Pricing is definitely reasonable and remember CASH ONLY!",5
"After living in LA for 5 years, I finally tried this place because it's probably one of the last ramen places in LA that I haven't tried.My boyfriend and I came here on a Monday at around 5pm and there wasn't any line-- thank god, otherwise we would have left and went somewhere else. I ordered the spicy miso ramen + BBQ eel set and he the tonkatsu ramen + ikura bowl. The portions were more than enough and I'm always a huge fan of those cabbage/ creamy dressing salads. BUUTTTT.... While I would have happily given this place 5 stars, I don't honestly think it's worth the hype. I'd wait maybe... 10-15 min max for this place. There are SO many other good ramen places in Little Tokyo that waiting over 10-15 min just doesn't make sense to me. Also, it was as hot as the Devil's armpit the day we went and there wasn't any AC or running fans so... Yeah, that sucked as well. It's good to try once just to say you've been, but I won't be back unless it's at an odd hour.",4
"This has been my favorite ramen spot ever since I moved to LA. It's pretty obvious that they are amongst the best since the wait is never shorter than one hour. Every time I come I always anticipate a long wait but it's completely worth it. This is the only reason I knocked down one star on their rating :)Okay, the food! I always order the spicy miso ramen. It's a huge bowl of deliciousness. The broth is rich and creamy with just the right amount of spice. Tender pork is layered on top of the perfectly cooked noodles. Then comes a heaping mountain of blanched bean sprouts and fresh green onions. That's all topped with some bamboo shoots. Words can't say enough. My mouth is salivating as I am writing this! The customer service is good here. I've never had any issues with the servers. There is parking nearby in several decks or you can park on the street if you're lucky. I usually take metro to get here since the station is walking distance away.Overall, great food and customer service. I definitely recommend!",4
"I only been here once when I don't come out to Little Tokyo often. I love ramen when its something I eat often even though its lots of carbs its my comfort food. I think for it being a chain restaurant the ramen is way better. I had the Daikokuya Kotteri Ramen with richer flavor. It was a large bowl with lots of ramen noodles and I was going yum, yum with every bite till the last noodle. I had some of the broth very tasty then not too much with it being oily. I had a big appetite that day that I was able to finish it all with a side of gyoza too. If its a cold day and you're in Little Tokyo you should consider trying this place when its a hidden gem.",5
I've never been open to anything like this type of food before and I tried it for the first time one of the best things I've ever had and ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_would ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_go back again for. Never thought I would like Ramen soup like this but it's something that you have to try especially if you're in the area and also worth the trip.,5
"If you want to come here make sure you either come at odd times (3-5pm) or prepare to wait for an hour (or more) :( This restaurant mimics the traditional Japanese ramen shops--very limited seating inside (hence the long wait), and the wooden interior gives it a very warm home-y feel. If you have a table of 5 or more you might have to split up because this place isn't group-friendly--they don't have tables for big groups. 1) D A I K O K U Y A ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_R A M E N:Every time I come here I always get this because this is the best thing on the menu. The soup base is nice and flavorful--not too oily but it's definitely rich. The noodles are really thick and chewy--the perfect texture! It comes with 2 piece of char siu and the char siu melts in your mouth. The egg is also nice and yolk-y inside. This is a must try! I love it :) 2) F R I E D ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_R I C E:The fried rice is sooo good! The rice is super flavorful with chunks of ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_pork inside. I don't even know what to say about this except it's really good and it's a must try! 3) G Y O Z A:The gyoza dish comes with 5 dumplings and it's perfectly crispy and there is a lot of meat inside which is great. It comes with green onions on top so if you don't like green onions make sure to tell them not to put it on ahead of time. Aside from the ridiculous waiting time which deters me from wanting to come here, Daikokuya is without doubt one of the best ramen shops in LA! Must try!",5
Good ramen places are so long to wait! I go to ramen places ones in a while and this one is really really good but LA can offer places where you don't have to wait for ages. I really need to visit Japan to get real authentic soup.,4
"I'm not a fan of ramen AT ALL. it just makes me think I'm eating the $1 ramen packages, but at home I can actually add more additives to it. I really hate the yellow noodles &amp; I feel like it's so little additives they put in it (meat, veggies etc) but I have to say the broth here was good! and my friends said its the best broth they've tasted. I'd give 4stars to the broth alone (even though for me I wouldn't go to a restaurant to eat ramen) also I love ginger, but did not like the purple pickle ginger here, really strong &amp; over powering. but the salad dressing really caught my mouth's attention! The gyoza was pretty good also &amp; the way it's cooked is unique from other places. overall the service was good, the wait is awhile &amp; there's always a line",4
Something about their broth in the ramen keeps me coming back for more! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's so good! The gyozas are a must try too if you have not tried it yet. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Best gyozas I've ever had by far! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Prepare to wait for a while. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is worth the wait.Cash only!,5
"Edit: I left a review 8 months ago and had given a higher rating, but I recently went back twice and noticed a substantial difference in the quality, price and quantity of the ramen.The ramen has increased by $1. It was $11, it is now $12. I am assuming the rest of the menu items has been adjusted to reflect this price increase. Secondly, the taste of the broth changed a bit and the amount of the ramen noodle decreased. Also the pork meat that was placed on top of the noodles was stringy and was not whole pieces. The last 2 times I came here, the meat was messily placed on top and were stringy and fatty.The fact that this is a cash only establishment ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_doesn't add to the appeal. I am a bit disappointed because I used to frequent this place frequently. It is not worth standing in line anymore...",3
"Always worth the wait! Staff is friendly &amp; efficient, and you can't beat this ramen in all of Little Tokyo.",5
"The hype is real. Came on a Tuesday for dinner and waited almost and hour. The food came out quickly, though and was delicious. The kicker here is the unique atmosphere- it feels like an old school diner in Japan (if that even exists).",5
The ramen is amazing and I ordered the yakisoba the 3rd time going and it's just as amazing.,5
"I was expecting so much from this place because of the 7k reviews but it did not live up to the hype. I must say, it could be because I don't eat pork. I had other non-pork dishes and I wasn't thrilled. The service was good tho",3
"Worth the wait. Epic noodles, broth, and other fixings. The side of roast pork was also incredible. Food also came around 2 mins after we ordered, which we appreciated after the line.",5
"Great ramen. Crowded, but fast. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth all has pork, so no vegetarian ramen, but they have other fish and chicken dishes and may have a vegetarian option.",4
"There's definitely a reason why this place is at the top of all the LA ramen lists. It's LEGIT. I got the Daikoku ramen, which was tonkatsu broth. The broth was insanely silky and rich. The noodles were the perfect firmness and the vinegar braised egg was perfectly done. Definitely coming back to try the spicy miso bowl! **CASH ONLY** so don't forget!",5
The ramen isn't tasting so good anymore . I want to try next door udon. I was disappointed last time I went to eat ramen,1
"This place is straight up fireeeeee. Litt. Bomb. Dank. The best ramen combos alive , like you get a small rice combo (I always get the eel) with ramen and salad for 15$-20$ which isn't too bad. The best of both worlds. No longer will I ever have to choose rice or ramen. Like why not both. The only thing bad about this place is the wait times, always 45 mins or so, but hey nothing good is ever perfect otherwise it'll be 6 stars. Prob one of the best ramen shops in Southern California. It's crazy cause when I was here, it was anime expo weekend so there were cosplayers and stuff eating so I was feeling like straight up out of an anime ya feelz? Like There were these white group of friends as Naruto and Sakura down the aisle. Like BRUH that's an extra star alone.",5
Must try if you're into trying authentic Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Very small location with sitting for group of 6 or 7 max. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Wait is usually about 45 min give or take but well worth the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Gyuzo is amazing and must try and the original ramen is super yummy.,5
Great ramen spot. Very authentic flavors and atmosphere. If you've been to Japan and lived there you will know what an authentic Japanese ramen is. Another thing about this place is the wait time. Sadly that is the downside to this place. It is always packed doesn't matter what time you go it's always full.,5
"Best ramen in Los Angeles. Their Spicy Miso Ramen is a flavorful revelation. The prices on food and alcohol are very reasonable for the portions you get.The wait time can be very long, but make no mistake: Daikokuya run a very tight ship. Crowds were light today, and I was in and out in 35 minutes. The long wait has more to do with their popularity and the small size of the restaurant than anything else.",5
"6466 reviews??? here's a +1.Its good ramen, not fabulous ramen!!! To put things into perspective, Daikokuya is worth a 20-30 min wait tops. If its longer then go to ...... (insert other hipster ramen name).",3
"Came here on a weekday for lunch just right about when they opened at 11am. There was already a small line and I had to wait about 10 minutes before I was seated at the bar. If you happen to come here other than when it first opens, always anticipate a long wait time! Anyways, after being seated at the bar I decided to order their specialty Daikoku Ramen which is a huge portion for a little less than $10! It's a steal if you ask me! The server was nice and very efficient. My ramen was definitely delicious. The broth was flavorful, the noodles were just right, eggs, cha su, bean sprouts, green onions ok maybe everything was just ON POINT. Overall I think it's a solid Ramen place but definitely nothing too special about it. I think it's a solid contender with all the other Ramen places I've been to but if I were to come back and wait an hour I don't know if I would... If you're looking for a solid Ramen place for lunch try getting here right when they open!",4
"First things first make sure you have cash. If you're craving ramen late at night, this is one of the better spots to go; the ramen was bomb. I would recommend the dipping ramen. Don't expect to stay there for long cause there's people waiting and they tend to slightly pressure you to leave.",4
"It's a bit filthy and stuffy in there. I came by myself so I had to sit with other strangers who came by themselves on the loser counter. I'm a bit muscular. I had a guy to the left of me and a guy to the right of me. It was a bit creepy because we were so close. It was so tight that my shoulders kept brushing against the 2 guys' shoulders on either side of me. It felt homo sectual. It felt like using a urinal with a guy on either side of me and my arms around their shoulders. That's how creepy it felt in there. Or you know how creepy it is at an adult video shop and you are looking at porn VHS tapes and there are guys in there next to you? That's how it felt. You have no personal space. You can only look down at your food. Oh ya, the Daikokuya Special Ramen was excellent. Costs $11. But soda $3 (sad face emoticon here)",5
"One of the most cost friendly ramen places in LA. Definitely worth what you pay, especially the combos. The combo I got had ramen and sake don (salmon) and it's super good and super fresh. Definitely worth the wait because you get way more than what you pay for, and the ramen is really good.",5
"Waited for an hour on a sataurday afternoon. The wait was not bad considered there were a lot of small stores around here.  ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My friend and I both ordered the combination with spicy miso ramen, one with fried rice and one with beef bowl. The beef was full with fat and the fried rice was flavorless. I waw disappointed. I would recomend getting only the ramen bowl and skip the combination. The noodle was chewy and soup base was decent.",3
Daikokuya owns my heart! This is some of the best ramen spots I have ever been too. Its literally a hole in the wall but so worth it. Expect a wait regardless of the time of day. The average when we go is an hour to 1 hr and 20 minutes. Its worth it though! Loooove me some some noodles from Daikokuya!,5
"My favorite ramen restaurant in LA!!! The long (45min-2+ hours) wait is soo worth it! Their signature Daikokuya ramen has a really creamy and rich broth, the chashu pork melts in your mouth, the noodles were nice and thick, and the EGG blew my mind. If you're not watching your weight, then definitely try the kotteri ramen for an even richer broth. I haven't tried the whole menu but everything looks soo appetizing. I really wanted to eat the gyoza, house salad, and combo deals if I could never get full haha. In my opinion, it's a little pricey (and it's CASH ONLY) but you get a lot of food and it's super delicious.",5
"This place is so delicious! Wonder why there's an hour long wait? It's because the food is just about as good as it gets. Pricey, but the portions more than make up for it, especially if you get a combo, which can EASILY feed two.I got a spicy umami ramen (not as spicy as I wood have preferred, fairly mild in fact) and a shredded pork bowl. I was super impressed with the pork bowl because it was made with pork belly, which is usually really fatty, but this wasn't at all.It's also a drag because they only accept cash.",5
"This place is for sure a great spot to eat at! Service is wonderful, the place is authentic &amp; the food is amazing. Definitely does get packed though! So make sure you stay and wait your turn, you won't be disappointed!",5
"Heard about this place through a friend and since I am always looking for the best ramen, I had to try it. I ordered the Daikokuya ramen with the extra flavor soup (I forgot the name of it) and a side of gyozas. I must say that the ramen came out piping hot. The soup was flavorful and not too salty. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the meat was a bit on the fatty side but I believe that was part of my order.I like that they are open late. It could be tough with a big group. I will come back again.",5
"Came here like a month ago and can't believe I didn't come here before: Best ramen ever!!! The vibe was great, the food was great, even though the local is small you actually feel like you're in Japan, and I've never been to Japan before so I don't even know. All I know is, I didn't feel like I was in America anymore and it was just an overall great experience! Would definitely come again!",5
"Love this place! They need to expand! Place gets super packed ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_most days which keeps me from going as often as I'd like, but it's soooo good! I love the pork belly and rice, and Ramen is the best!",5
"One of the most delicious ramen places I've ever been to in LA!! Seriously the broth was so savory and not to salty at all! Spicy miso ramen was so delicious! I actively had to try and not lick the bowl clean! The pork was melt in your mouth good, the egg was perfectly cooked, and the noodles had the perfect amount of firmness! I have to come back with more people and show them how amazing this place is! The service was fantastic and waiters were happy to answer any questions about the menu. As many other reviews say, the wait is really long! We came on a Thursday night around 6pm and the wait was about 30-40minutes. Needless to say, if you're in good company it doesn't really matter. Once seated, the waiters were not trying to flip tables or hurry you out, but out of respect to other customers everyone would eat and get up. Also, we had the deep fried spicy tuna wrapped in shisho leaf appetizer. It was tasty, however for the price we expected more food/more spicy tuna per piece. I would say, appetizers aren't necessary to order because the ramen bowl is plenty and the main attraction!",4
"Although most nights are super busy, you might have better luck at lunch time if you hate waiting. The parking is sparse in little Tokyo and the wait is long, but it's definitely work the ramen. They have a combo where you get a hefty bowl of ramen a small rice place and a house salad. Super filling for the price you're paying. The service is really quick! Spicy miso ramen is my favorite here. Also they now have cold ramen for those hot LA days (which is practically everyday) . Try it before you question it.!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_CASH ONLY !!!",5
"It really didn't live up to the hype. Service was very good. Food very meh. They didn't even slice open the egg like it shows on the pictures. Noodles had a soapy water taste and the soup didn't have enough flavor. The gyozas were very sloppy looking, oily and the filling was good either.",2
"I LOVE DAIKOKUYA. Gosh dang it. Those noodles in that yummy broth. And that chasu with soft boiled egg.... why do you know how much I love eggs???!!, especially all soft and boily like. And do I need to mention that when I just want ramen and a little something else like fried rice or chicken with eggs and rice, I could just get a combo convienently.Now to other notable things to mention:1. This place is SMALL. I'm talking about a few booths and a bar. No joke. 2. No take out. Yes you heard me. You eat here and only here3. There's a line... a LONG line all the dang time. Prepare yourself. 4. Cash only. Yup.. you heard me. Get that paper.Other than that.. service is quick and like all the other 1000s of people have mentioned, this place is damn good.",4
I dream of this place. Consistently some of the best ramen and one of the best eats in DTLA. Cash only.There is usually a line out the door.I recommend the classic ramen bowl with an extra egg. The egg is where it's at.,5
"Have to admit considering the long wait this place is pretty darn good. Coming from Asia and setting my standards pretty darn high .Service, starting from waiting they come out to tell which number.Instead of just having to come in and pray hopefully that you are next. And to the menu we go even though there were only 2 options for the ramen with an addition towards toppings the daikoku was pretty good and the broth was good.But clearly the winnner ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_was the tsukemen where they basically deconstructed the Waikiki ramen.So what makes it better the broth its a lot richer plus clearer ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and there secretly were more chunks of meat then the daikoku although in assuming that was a fluke. And that's is it.",5
"The ramen here is good, but I was disappointed because of the hype that surrounds this place and I don't feel like it lived up to it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The crowds were literally out the door, and the waiting list took about two hours before they got to us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The inside is very small and cramped, but I thought it was very cute with the wooden decor on the walls and other features that gave it a warm atmosphere. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's very bustling and busy inside as well! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They take your order and get the ramen to you as quickly as they can since there's so many people waiting for a seat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I wish they had better options for a spicier ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It honestly wasn't even close to being the best ramen I've had, I think Ramen Hood and Tsujita both have much better bowls. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It still tasted great! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just doesn't live up to the hype that surrounds the place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And cash only, really?? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Come on, it's 2017 now. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's good business to offer payment in credit and debit cards, I had to limit how much I ordered because of the cash only requirement. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All in all, a long and stressful wait for good ramen that doesn't even match up to much better places. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't think I'll be back.",4
"My 2nd time here and it's still my fav place for Ramen. The broth is the best, lots of flavour. You know it's the best cause there's always a wait no matter when you go.I ordered the Spicy miso ramen this was truly yum. We also ordered the spicy salmon sushi, fresh fish and light bites the perfect combination.The food is quick to roll out so once inside you are almost done in 30mins.It's a little warm inside so don't wear anything warm. :)Must try!!",5
"I've come here several times and it's easily the go to Ramen joint. There is always a line so that speaks for itself. Don't come if pure in a rush to eat because you'll be waiting at least a half hour to be seated. Once you're seated let the chop sticks go to work. The spicy ramen bowl is fire every time the go to, and I get the pork bowl to go. I usually don't eat pork but their pork bowl is perfection. It's a great place to eat with friends. It's packed but it's what you'd expect at a traditional Japanese restaurant.Cash Only",5
"I had been hearing good things about Daikokuya for ages, so I had to see for myself.Details:January 1, 2014 my son told me he was in the mood for ramen and I thought it would be a good opportunity to try this place out if they were open on New Year's Day. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I called them at about 10:00 a.m. and I was told they would be open from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Friends have told me that this particular location gets really busy, so I decided I better try to get there a little before they open. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My son and I arrived at 10:50 a.m. and there were two people ahead of us waiting to get in. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A few steps away a homeless man was sitting on the steps of the hotel and he was yelling to himself and he seemed very agitated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was hoping this mama bear wasn't going to have to defend her cub even though my son is about three inches taller than me and a little stronger. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Thankfully, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_we didn't have a confrontation and we were able to get seated a few minutes later:Food: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_4/5 StarsI ordered the Daikoku Ramen for $8.95. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It includes the tonkotsu soup base, boiled chijire style egg noodles, pork belly, chashu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions and a little sprinkle of sesame seeds. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I liked it, but when I bit into the egg the inside was cold. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My son ordered the Daikoku Ramen combo with a small bowl of tempura for $12.95. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_He loves ramen, but did not care for the broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_He only ate about half of the bowl and didn't want to take the rest to go. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Thank you to Wan L. for telling me in advance you can order a half order of the ramen, but I totally forgot. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I wish I had remembered because I can never finish a whole bowl.Service: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_4/5 StarsWe were seated immediately when we walked in and it helped that we arrived about 10 minutes before they opened. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The restaurant is very small, so it doesn't hold very many people. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Parking: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_2/5 StarsAnyone who knows me knows I hate to pay for parking. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We could not find street parking, so we parked in the structure across the street on the corner of Central and 1st and ended up paying $7.00 for 45 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Me no likey paying that much for under an hour.Misc. Info:This restaurant is cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Thankfully, I had cash for a change and I caught my near over payment. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I put down a $50 and a $10 instead of a $20 and a $10, but double checked at the last minute. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_That would have been an expensive lunch for two. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Something wasn't quite right with the lock on the men's room door and my son cut his finger on it when he was trying to get out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_He said it looked rusty too, but he's current on his tetanus booster. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My grandfather died from lock jaw after stepping on a pitch fork.I'd definitely come back if I was downtown at the Music Center or in the area.",3
"A San Diegan's Los Angeles Food Adventure! Fear not, there is a parking structure nearby.Small restaurant that seats about 20 people total. However, it's decorated well to look very much like the alleyways in Japan, so that's a nice little treat.The ramen broth is very flavorful and fatty. It's good enough to drink alone without being too salty, but I'd be careful for the sake of one's own health. The fatty pork and soft boiled egg was delicious. The noodles themselves were a tad undercooked, so it had a bit of a bite to the tooth I did not expect. Service was just okay. They took away my friend's appetizer before they finished but my friend let it go.I can see why it's popular for the locals, but not a necessary stop for me. This was so-so in my food adventure",4
"I was craving ramen and decided to try this spot out. There was wait but since I was alone I literally put my name down, got seated, ordered a beer &amp; ramen, and received my food all within 10 minutes. No lie! The vegan ramen was my only choice since I don't eat pork. It. Was. Delicious. I'll definitely be coming back and it might always be alone so I won't have to wait. Hahaha.",5
"I feel like I'm back in Japan.Love the decor of the restaurant. It's laid back in here. There was a line when we arrived. Write your name and the number of people in your party on the list. Restrooms are available in the back. Employees are quick and friendly. Menu is straightforward. I like that they have combination bowls. All bowls come with a Salad and Daikoku Ramen. The Gyoza had a lightly crisp and tender exterior. The filling was flavorful. It was jam packed with green onions. The Salad was simple and tasty, a generous serving of shredded cabbage with a ginger mayo based dressing. Fried Rice was seasoned well and not overly greasy. Shredded Pork Bowl was a meal in itself. Generous serving of sliced pork with a sweet soy glaze on top of rice. Star of the show was the Daikoku Ramen. The broth had layers of flavor. It was not too heavy nor was it light. It comes with Chijire Style Egg Noodles, Kurobuta Pork Belly, Boiled Egg, Bamboo Shoots, Bean Sprouts, Green Onions, and Sesame Seeds. The noodles had a perfect chew. Not overly heavy or starchy. The Pork Belly was thinly sliced and had more meat than fat on it, which was nice. Daikokuya loves it's green onions. Almost every one of our dishes had a generous serving of it. Overall, we left incredibly full and with a to go bag. Good eats indeed.",4
"This place was so yummy and worth the hype! I mean there's 6,000+ reviews... People aren't lying when they say the line gets long for lunch/dinner. We came at 5pm to put our name on the wait list and we didn't get seated until ~ 5:45. We left around 7pm and there was a bunch of people forming a line outside. The restaurant is a bit small but can sit at least parties of 4-5 in the booths and they also have individual seats along where the chefs cook. It can get a bit stuffy though. I got the Daikokuya ramen with kotteri (back fat) which made the soup broth that much better! I also got a small side of tonkatsu don and it was delicious. The waiter we had was super attentive even though the restaurant was already busy (all tables filled) He kept refilling our water and came whenever we needed something. This place is definitely worth a try if you're in Japantown! Or it's even worth going out of your way for :)",5
"BY FAR THE BEST RAMEN SPOT I HAVE EVER EATEN AT. If you're looking for authentic ramen, this is definitely the spot to go to. Prices are so reasonable too!",5
One of the best places we've ever eaten regardless of price or cuisine type. Consistently delicious,5
"Was sooo excited to try Daikokuya. I'm new to the ramen scene and basically heard this was THE place to get the best ramen in LA. My fellow yelper Tim C. (shout out to Tim C.) asked me if I wanted to go so off we went to little Tokyo.We went Friday around 6:30 &amp; it wasn't too packed yet - probably waited about 30 minutes. Peering inside the restaurant while waiting outside, I figured out why the line is so damn long all the time....there's no seats! This place only has about 7-8 booths and a small counter for seating so it's no wonder there's always a wait. It's definitely not the cleanest looking place inside but I managed.Food: I ordered the Daikoku ramen, kotteri style. The soup came in a giant bowl with a soft boiled egg, tons of green onions &amp; some other fixins. The soup was very good &amp; not greasy at all. My 2 knocks were that the noodles were more firm than I liked &amp; the soup wasn't that hot, more luke warm than anything. Parking: meter or the 2 parking lots nearby (about $7-8)Service: I might come back just for the Japanese Captain Jack Sparrow waiter!While it was good, I definitely like Hakata Shin Sen Gumi better. I like that you can customize there &amp; overall I just felt it was better ramen. They (Shin Sen Gumi) are kind stingy on the chashu there though &amp; Daikokuya gave you a lot more in your soup.All in all, I'd go back if someone really wanted to try it but for now, I'm off to try Benten Ramen...",3
"6 booths and 12 seats at the counter, it's an ""cash only"" institution of a place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If it wasn't for parking being a pain (and at least $5), I think I would live here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ So good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The rating is over a 4.0, but under a 5.0. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I tried a bunch of items: tuna sashimi, ramen, gyoza, and shredded pork bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Each was worthy.1. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ramen &amp; Shredded Pork Bowl -- it's all about the soup base. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Well, if you like a strong mushroom and green onion flavor, this Ramen is for you. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles are devine. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Kurobuta Pork Belly is amazing ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_(more...more...more), marinated boiled egg. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Generous portion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_($13.95, 4.5 stars)2. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Pork &amp; Vegetable Gyoza -- stuck together, had this once before, makes this a spectacle. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Nicely cooked, but more cabbage than meat, making the consistency strange. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_($5.95, 3.0 stars)3. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tuna Sashimi -- kinda pricey, but very fresh. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_($9.50, 4.5 stars)4. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Mug of Kirin draft - $2.50 for a mug? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Unbelievable price making this a pour-all-day situation. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_(5.0 stars) Service was very nice by a sweet gal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall, a good experience worth repeating.Tip: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_On a Wednesday night, a short 20 minute wait at 5pm, then at 630pm -- practically no one was there. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Has the mad rush died down at Daikokuya? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Go at 630pm!",4
"This place is a GEM! I'm far from being any kind of noodle expert, I'm just picky and rather new to it all, however, all the raving reviews did not lie! I ordered their original daikoku and my girlfriend ordered the spicy miso. Both of us could not be happier with our 11:00 pm dinners, haha. Their staff was also really charming. I actually really liked the environment. Small, a bit dated, crack in the wall business, but, that in intself just made the experience better.",5
"Hate the wait but love their ramen... I got there 30 mins before opening and there was already a line! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Crazy! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Good thing I was 3rd in line, Phew! I usually order the the Daikokuya Ramen but I found a new fave...SPICY MISO RAMEN! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is kind of salty (well it's miso, DUH! =P) but very TASTY. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Chashu was tender and had a good amount of fat and meat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This time around the noodles were a little overcooked and they forgot my egg =( Tip: Half size ramen available! (for those watching their figure) Order the Combo and get the Fried Rice or Shredded Pork Bowl! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All combos comes with a side of shredded cabbage salad. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Love the salad and the dressing! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I can eat two bowls! Service: GoodParking: street metered parking ($3/hr) or various lots/structures.",4
"TIP: CASH ONLYI finally got to try Daikokuya with some cousins after a rather uneventful DTLA trip.I opted for the Daikoku ramen with kotteri. Extremely flavorful. The broth was fairly rich, and the noodles were cooked well. To my surprise, my egg was cooked perfectly with the yolk still a bit wet (fun fact: if you leave an egg in hot broth, it WILL cook!) The pork was also good, but I wish they added a bit more.Now, for the kotteri. Ordering your ramen with kotteri means adding some back fat goodness on top. However, I'd suggest thinking twice before getting it.Now, before you criticize me, you should know that I thought the back fat was amazing. Seriously, it adds a ton of flavor to their ramen. That little film of fat right on top is lip smacking (and for me, shirt staining) goodness.However, after eating a quarter of my ramen, I realized that it was way too much flavor. It becomes overwhelming after a while. If anything, it's something your inebriated self would enjoy, but not your sober self.If it's your first time, I suggest giving kotteri a shot, but make sure you get those water refills coming. I'll be getting a Daikoku ramen WITHOUT kotteri next time.Onwards to the rest of my review:I also got the combination and chose the chicken katsu bowl. It was pretty good for the most part. They definitely drowned my chicken katsu in egg. The rice is also really good.The salad that came initially was tasty as well. Their house made dressing on top of the salad kind of reminds me of a burger for some reason. Nonetheless, it was good.Servers were friendly and quick.The only downside is the wait. We came in around 7 p.m. on a Tuesday and had to wait about an hour. If we came any later, I'm sure we would've had to wait longer. The line forms fast.All-in-all, this place serves a mean bowl of ramen. If you're in the area, I'd suggest considering this place. That's assuming you don't mind waiting.",4
"CASH ONLY! This place has delicious ramen and it's all due to that delicious broth that has a lot of love. It was also my first experience with dip ramen or ""cold"" noodles and toppings with plain broth on the side. Yummy! Parking seems like a hassle so take advantage of the Metro and fill your day/evening with Japanese cuteness!!",5
"A group of 4 came here on a Wednesday afternoon...around 2pm. We had to wait about 30-40 minutes. We got seated, but it took a while for our servers to take our drink and food orders. I had to flag down several people because we were starving and no one was coming to take our orders. I got the combination spicy miso ramen with shredded pork rice bowl. The ramen broth was so flavorful and wasn't too spicy. The shredded pork was nicely marinated with ginger and green onions. It was delicious. I suggest coming in during off hours to avoid the long waits. Parking is provided in the structure, but it's not free.",4
"Came for lunch on a Monday and waited for 15 minutes or so (party of 2). I had the Spicy Sesame because our waiter quickly recommended that over the other vegan option, a tomato based ramen. It was delicious. Cash only, but there is an ATM in back. I left full, happy, and impressed with the fast service in such a cozy-almost-cramped space. Being a casual ramen fan, I only eat Japanese ramen when I can tolerate the rich and salty broth. Having said that, I thought the broth here was delicious.",5
"I ordered the yakisoba which was pretty good, but I couldn't stop eating the house specialty-- Daikoku Ramen. Yowza! It was so good I wanted to move in. I'll be back as often as I can.",5
"I studied culinary arts in Japan for a long time and their tonkatsu ramen is just spot on. Depth of flavour, slightly creamy, nice noodles. I will say their chasu is the best I've had in LA so far. Definitely worth trying but keep in mind this place runs a wait list non stop. I subtracted one star because their floor staff seemed to generally hate life. I realise their busy but the girl working the wait list first just tossed a clipboard at me and said nothing. Do I write my name down or do you? Pretty basic. Then she called names and their number once, marked that she called them, and maybe repeated once if at all. You should definitely take note of what number you are on the list and make sure you listen for your number coming up. Lots of people come and take off and then miss their number and its sort of a circus. Once seated the girl who took our order was good but she disappeared and getting a check was a major effort with another waitress who refused to look up until we all just stood up. Definitely give it a try. Don't wait a long time and don't try and bring a group.",4
"We came here on a Friday night right after we had eaten from Marugame Monzo next door (amazing udon!), because this place was also on my list of must-tries in little tokyo. Luckily, we were able to grab a seat at the bar immediately even though there was a line out the door. We ordered the daikokuya ramen with koteri (?) combo with fried rice. The ramen was just okay in my opinion, but the fried rice was amaze-balls! They used the same cha su that they used in their ramen, which was melt in your mouth amazing. Each bite of the fried rice contained some of the pieces of pork fat which made it so much more flavorful and melt in your mouth. I would definitely come back just to get the fried rice!",4
"A ramen place open until 2AM.... +6,000 reviews... 4.5 stars!?!? It's a must try if you're in socal!I came here (with a party of 3) on a Thursday night at 1030PM and got seated an hour later. Damn, an hour wait when it's extremely late at night?! It was so worth it though. We all ordered the original daikokuya ramen with extra corn and nori. We also ordered one coke bc they had free refills (from the tap)!! The ramen lived up to the hype. The broth was insanely flavorful. It wasn't overwhelmingly oily. It had great noodle to broth ratio. The meat was soft and well cooked. The noodles were kinda clumped together sorta, but it was easily separated and was soft. The nori is shredded, which I don't prefer, but it was still good. The corn definitely made it better! The egg was broiled(??). I think it was prepared in the same way as adobo! Haha but it was so good. The egg wasn't hard broiled, and was flavorful. The price is reasonable. The parking is difficult, as it is in Little Tokyo. It's a great place to visit if you don't mind waiting! Little Tokyo is also a great place to visit so stop by this place!!****CASH ONLY****",5
"Been to the one in Sawtelle, I like this location way better. The service here is superior to the one in Sawtelle. On a weekday afternoon, there was still about a 30-40 minute wait. Small waiting area had some interesting finds to keep you occupied, though.My friend got the gyoza here. I was in awe when it was brought out, never had I seen a presentation of gyoza ($5.95) served like that. It was still good though. I like how the ramen comes with everything I would already want in my bowl. Their egg is perfection. Broth is too freakin good, creamy slurping goodness. At $9 a bowl, it is a well portioned meal. Their combination offerings are not bad either.",4
Prepare to wait in line due to its popularity. Order the Daikoku ramen and add corn and an egg. Delicious ramen! It's worth the wait.,5
"Waited 45 minutes for a party of five, sat at the bar, ordered the spicy miso ramen with an order of nori. I enjoyed my spicy soup, had a sip &amp; bite of the Daikoku Ramen my kid &amp; husband ordered, not too shabby, but I love my stuff with a kick, so I did good! Flight from the East Coast for this ramen was well worth it. Ok, we came to see family &amp; friends, this little trip to Little Tokyo was awesome.",5
"A hot bowl of ramen with fatty pork and a soft boil egg is a great meal on a cold day, but when you see a line out the door when it's 98 degrees you know that this ramen shop is top notch. I've visited daikokuya on a number of occasions and their ramen never disappoints. Try a bowl for yourself and you won't be sorry.",5
Delicious and authentic ramen in little Tokyo. There is usually a long wait but it's well worth it! The portions are big and they always put a lot of pork in their ramen. Definitely one of the top ramen places in LA.,4
I've been to a few ramen places and this is still my top favorite. The menu is simple and food service is quick!,5
"With over 7 thousand reviews so we decided to try it out, the worst ramen i had ever have, restaurant is super dirty inside, restroom is super grossed and dirty....",1
"I had high expectations, and Daikokuya lived up to them! I loooove ramen, and I am always on the lookout for places that serve tsukumen since having the legit thing in Japan last year for the first time. The noodles here are perrrrrfect - chewy, al dente, and curly. I liked the tsukumen noodles better than the regular ramen noodles, but both are delish. My tsukumen and bf's ramen both came with 2 huge slices of chashu which had the perfect amount of lean and fatty meat. I had a bite of my bf's ramen, and that was also really good, and his broth was chock full of flavor without being too salty.There was no wait for 2 on a weekday early afternoon, so if you can, try to come during off hours. It is worth the wait (I don't think I'd wait more than 30 minutes though), but if you can avoid it, why not?Love that they have multiple locations, but I wonder if they serve tsukumen at all of them? If so, I will definitely frequent 626 locations whenever I've got a ramen craving!",4
"Ramen is not my prefered meal of choice, but this place is really good.",4
"mmmm ramyun :) Of course this isn't my first time at daikokuya but I'm finally writing a review and yes, they did raise their price since the last time I went but oh well as long as it doesn't affect the taste of the ramyun I'm good. My friend and I decided to eat here after a long hike with my friend... I ordered the spicy miso combo with the tuna sashimi bowl $16.95 and my friend ordered the daikokuya ramen combo with the beef Bowl $13.95? Around that price.The spicy miso wasn't as spicy but it definitely had a really heavy broth. It's like you can tell that the broth was made with time and effort it's not your mediocre ramen broth.I think I would've rather liked the regular daikokuya ramen than the spicy miso because it had a cleaner finish and it was less heavy.The tuna was fresh on the tuna sashimi Bowl and the rice wasn't regular steamed rice which I was very surprised about they use seasoned rice to go perfectly with your sashimi. It's One Of Those places that you know is good and most of the time it's what you expect. HahaCash only parking is a pain in the ass and you may be stuck on the wait list for a really long time hahaha",4
"Believe all the Yelp hype (all the numerous 5-star reviews) - this place is AMAZING! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've been to Daikokuya twice now. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Most recently, I visited during the holidays a couple of weeks ago. This place is PACKED and you have to put your name down on the list and wait for 1-3 hours (depending on how busy it is when you visit). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We put our names down for a table for 3 at around 6:30pm and weren't seated until close to 8pm. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Granted, it was a Saturday night, but it's still a crazy busy wait, especially compared to some of the other nearby restaurants in Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The atmosphere is awesome - there's a bar as well as a few tables. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's quite a small place, but feels homey and authentic.The service was impeccable from start to finish. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They must have thousands of people filter through this place each day and yet the servers never rush you. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They are always polite, nice, and very helpful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Since I'm not the biggest ramen fan (blasphemy, I know!), I opted to get the tuna sashimi bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was DELICIOUS! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Very fresh tuna in a generous portion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The others in our party LOVED their ramen (and they were first-time ramen eaters). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They are Daikokuya believers now. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My food came with miso soup and a salad. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ginger-based salad dressing at Daikokuya is the best salad dressing I've ever tasted at an Asian restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Hands down the best. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And it's for sale too - just $6 a bottle! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ended up buying a bottle - such a great investment.This place is totally worth the wait. Every minute of it.I repeat: TOTALLY. WORTH. THE. WAIT.Just a couple of (additional) tips: -Make sure you have your entire party available when they call your name. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Otherwise, you won't get seated.-There's a fun outdoor Japanese shopping center right across the street and you can check that out while you wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But remember, be available when they call your name!-Parking is going to be scarce, since it is, after all, downtown LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There are some nearby lots, so make sure you plan in advance! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_-The legendary, ambrosial salad dressing is for sale for $6 a bottle - GET SOME!",5
Best ramen in the city. You will not be disappointed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's cash only so be prepared. They have great bowls as well. Appetizers are very good as well. The only thing is long waits but well worth it. Trust me!,5
"After several visits, I wouldn't wait for 2+ hours for the food. However, this is still a MUST VISIT for the 1st timer. I've heard stories on how each Daikokuya location has slightly different broth recipe. Well all I know is one thing - this is the ONLY Daikokuya you'll ever need to visit. Daikoku Ramen + small shredded pork bowl w/ salad ($12.95): Amazing consistency - still tasted the same as my last visit. However - after having visited multiple ramen restaurants, I did noticed the broth tasted just a LITTLE bit (it was really subtle) salty. Heck, I shouldn't even complain - chashu pork melted in my mouth and broth was flavorful. Both shredded pork bowl and ginger miso salad dressing were delicious as well. Takoyaki ($4.95): Not the best, but pretty solid. Can't really go wrong with this order. Overall - Daikokuya continues to serve high quality ramen (one of the best chashu, good ramen noodle, and close-to-perfect broth). Not only that, side orders just make the dining experience even better. Solid 4.5-star.",5
"this place is super popular and for good reason, they probably have the best ramen around but the wait is usually insanely long :(, i would say this is a great place to go if you can stand the wait. The prices are fair and service is pretty good but the wait can last up to 2 hours + sometimes so keep that in mind before you go. oh and make sure you get the ramen with the extra fatty soup (there's a little option for it on the menu) it is fatty but hey YOLO right?!",4
"My favorite ramen place! I live in nor cal and I get so excited when I get to eat their ramen. There's always a line, waited about 30 mins. It's my first time at this location, small place. Workers were very friendly. The food came out really quickly (maybe because they were closing in 30, 40 mins). It look good and taste amazing. I got the daikokuya ramen + fried rice.",5
Come on.best Ramen in downtown LA.Commit and live,5
"Wonderful ramen! Excellent service. There's a wait on the weekends but the system is user-friendly. You write your name on a list which is accessible to everyone. No imperious host making inexplicable seating choices. The restaurant is small, but friendly. And the menu is an easy read. They have booths and a counter. Midnight supper for 2 was $40 including the tip. Cash only.",5
"It was a pleasure to experience an authentic ramen experience being from the east coast. Being that my trip was so short I had to decide amongst LA's best ramen spots and could only choose one spot due to time constraints and hoped it was my best ramen experience. I would say aside from the 1.5 hour wait, the ramen was good but not my favorite. I enjoyed NYC Ippudo much more. The broth was somewhat bland and I imagine this is the type of broth purist go for. Even the pork did not do much for me, seemed to be just placed on instead of blend in. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork belly bowl and gyozas were exceptional however and the staff was friendly and hard working. Still glad I came to experience this but hoped to know another LA spot to compare this to.",3
I got the spicy ramen. I don't think they cook the noodles from scratch and I wish the flavor was a bit bolder. But the portion size and service were good!,3
"This place has the BEST damn Ramen I've ever had! Located on the outskirts of LA in Little Tokyo, it definitely is a great location and represents well. After 8 pm, it usually gets crowded and it's a little snug on the seating. Because of its popularity, there may be a waitlist but it's worth every second. Highly Recommend! Cash Only.",5
"I really like this restaurant! I would for sure recommend this anyone who likes ramen noodles!I had their special ramen, it came with noodles, pork slices, soft boiled egg, green onions, bean sprouts, among all sorts of other deliciousness.I ordered the tempura as my side, it was good but my boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken on the side and we liked that even more. Also I just want to add that the waiter and waitress were so friendly and attentive! Don't be intimidated they will help you order, explain menu items and make sure you enjoy.",5
"I love ramen and I think everyone knows that about me.I can eat it all day, any time, any temperature.So when my hubby and I decided to take a mini vacation, I told him I wanted to eat here and that was my only plan.We got here around lunch time and the wait was fairly long. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Walking up the place, the sidewalk was crowded with people. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was pregnant at the time, so I was happy to find a tiny chair inside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The place was really warm and the seat was very uncomfortable. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_What can you do though?After about a 30 minute wait, we were seated at the bar. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They then were attentive to us, which was great.My husband ordered the tuna sashimi rice bowl, which he enjoyed. I just ate my cabbage salad which came with our meal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_By the way, the dressing on the salad is amazing.Finally our soups came, which we decided to stick to their main ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Daikoku Ramen came out full of flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles were on the thicker side, which was fine. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They're kind of like Orenchi's noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was flavorful, but still not super salty or anything. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork belly was perfect. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We also ordered the Shredded Pork Bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We actually didn't eat very much of it because we were so full from the soup! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork was delicious and i'd definitely recommend getting the bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I can't wait to come back here again. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's even better than it's located in Little Tokyo because you can walk around and enjoy the shops after.CASH ONLY BTW!",5
"Being on vacation and craving ramen can sometimes be a pain because you just never know what you're gonna get. I'm usually super picky when it comes to ramen, and this place met all my standards! I hear people usually wait for hours just to get a table, but my party and I got lucky and only waited about 20 minutes. The place is really small, so I understand why the wait can be so long. It's really a plus that they're open late. I got the Spicy Miso and Fried Rice combo. First off, let me just say that the fried rice was so good! Not something you would expect from a place that specializes in ramen. Definitely worth trying!! The broth for the spicy miso wasn't bad, but I had some of boyfriend's broth (daikokuya), and it was so much better! I really enjoyed my food regardless. The egg was perfectly soft boiled and the perfect touch!Service was not bad at all. Our server was attentive and super friendly even though we were there a little late. So glad I gave this place a try! Definitely coming back whenever I can!",5
"Although there are plenty of ramen places I have yet to try, I really like Daikokuya. Their menu is straightforward and their food is delicious. My go-to dish is the combination that includes ramen and a small pork cutlet bowl ($12.95). The ramen is delicious, the egg is cooked perfectly, and the broth is rich and flavorful. The combination has various rice bowls to choose from, but I love the pork cutlet one. The combination also comes with a small salad, which is nothing more than a bowl of shredded cabbage with a thousand island-like dressing. Sometimes they overdo the dressing, which makes part of the salad pretty much inedible so see if you can get the dressing on the side. I always forget to ask.The only downside to Daikokuya is the ridiculously long wait. If you go during peak hours, expect to wait at least 45 minutes, probably more, since the restaurant is not very big. Probably no more than 6 booths and ""bar"" seating which fits about 12 or so. Go early to avoid the wait. Last time I went at 5:30pm on a Thursday and we didn't have to wait at all. However, by the time we left, there were a lot of people waiting.My only complaint is that I felt super rushed the entire time I was there. The servers are nice, but we were asked multiple times mid-meal if we wanted to pack our leftover food, which would've been fine if my friend wasn't still with chopsticks and spoon in hand eating! Then, when my friend stopped eating for a second to talk, they came around and asked again. We can't continuously keep eating you know? And we hadn't been there for more than 30 minutes. It really became quite ridiculous, to a point where we just said screw it and got our food packed. I understand the restaurant is super busy, but it was just too much.Parking is either street or structure. The meters are $3/hour (free after 8pm) and most of the lots are about $4-5 at night. FYI, Daikokuya is cash only!",4
"Ambiance: small, tiny and old establishment, try your luck for street parking, otherwise there's parking garage around little Tokyo village plaza. waiting line is always long, expect at least one hour before get seatedService: not very friendly, kinda slow and impatient Food: general ok, not very exciting though ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Gyoza - **** pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings, crispy and tasty, recommend ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikoku Ramen - **** the signature ramen here, standardized as other daikokuya stores, recommend ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Fried rice - **** onions, green onions, egg, corn, imitation crab, and chashu pork with rice, surprisingly great taste, recommend ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Chicken egg bowl - ** chopped chicken leg cooked with egg and onion in a house soy sauce, very very salty, not recommend ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tempura bowl - *** shrimp and veggies, average taste ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tuna sashimi bowl - *** fresh and average taste ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Teriyaki eel bowl - ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_**** very delicious eel over rice, recommendPrice: expect $25 each if you over ordered a lotThough it has over five thousand reviews, this place has been overrated. Waiting time was too long, there's other same level or even better ramen places, so not worth it.",3
"5,000 reviews and a 4-starred rating can't be wrong. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ordered a Shredded Pork Bowl ($9) and a Ramen ($9) based on the many previous Yelp reviews.The Shredded Pork Bowl was heavenly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Bascially, it was a bowl of sushi rice covered by finely shredded pork in a unique sauce. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The sauce was a perfectly balanced soy sauce with sugar and ginger, but take my words, it didn't taste like terriyaki sauce. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It also had all the grease that a pork rice bowl was entitled to, but it didn't feel greasy.If I only count the ramen selection in the printed booklet and ignore the 3 pieces of paper flyer posted temporarily on the wall, the ramen menu has exactly ONE (1) item. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is called RAMEN. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is no description on what is in the ramen bowl or broth whatsoever. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would suggest that there is room for improvement in this aspect. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen itself was delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodle was fresh and al denta. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was richly flavoured like a sauce but diluted like a soup. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It tasted like miso plus pork essence plus sugar plus pork lard plus a lot of other ingredients that I can't figure out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_In term of protein, there was only a few pieces of pork and an egg and no veggie.The food worthed 5 stars. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The services worthed 2 stars. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was slow. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The attitude of the 3 waitresses were less than friendly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They might be overworked, or they didn't think people would stop lining up for 30 minutes for a table any time soon.",4
3 words:Best cabbage salad.Very heavy and hearty but tasty. Make sure to drink a lot of water to prevent feeling like shot afterwards.,5
"Still the best ramen I've ever had. Look no further than the original daikoku ramen. The broth simmers for weeks I believe. If there's better, I haven't had it.",5
This is a review of the service. Service was slow they crammed us into a table too small for our party. The place is cash only WTF bill came to $101 before tip i give 120 cause all i have is 20s from the atm and i ask him for change. (On the bill they hand write a total adding 20% tip to encourage tipping i guess) Guy says ok then never comes back. We ask again for change and he comes back to the table with $1.20 the change from his handwritten total adding his 20%. F*** this A** hole that is not change on my bill! Food was good but I wont go back unless you want to get my money jacked again!!,1
This place has great ramen.I always get the spicy miso ramen. And you can get a combo for a few more bucks for a little riceBowl. It has huge portions. The only thing sucks is the wait because it's such a tiny restaurant. But the wait has never stopped me from dining here. I love introducing my friends to this place.You should stop by!!,5
"It was my first time at this place. This place is very popular. When my friends and I came here, we had to be wait listed. Although the place gets packed easily as well as being wait listed, I would definitely come back here for their beyond delicious ramen bowl! FOOD - 5 starsIt was my first time trying an actual legit RAMEN, so I had expectations before coming here. Those expectations were met beyond my imagination. I ordered the Daikoku Ramen w/ Koterri Flavor. It came in a huge bowl. I tried the broth and oh my goodness! It had a very deep flavor and was delicious! The noodles were perfectly done as well as the meat. The egg was perfect too. Everything in the bowl was perfect! Lol My first time eating ramen and it was a heavenly first time experience. =)CUSTOMER SERVICE - GoodI have a rating of customer service from 0 being the lowest (not worth rating) to excellent. The list starts from Excellent, Good, Okay, Worse, 0. The customer service was good at this place despite how busy the place was. Our waiter came by three times: to ask for our order, ask how we were doing, and taking our bowls away. Regardless of serving us three times, he was a good waiter. He was also nice and friendly. Also, there's not much for a customer service because it was mostly self serve. Everything you needed was right there beside you. Overall, the service at this place was surprisingly good regardless of how busy the place was. I definitely will be coming back! DEFINITELY! ^_^ Lol ADVICE: Bring cash with you! It's the only payment for this place. But other than that, it's so worth the money! :D",5
"Best to come before they open or you could wait up to an hour. If you take the wait you won't regret it, Best ramen I have ever had.",5
"Came here during off hours(approx 2pm) and had to wait about 30-40 minutes. When seated, I was really disappointed with the service. The waiter didn't come to our table to take our order, so we had to flag down two different people. Finally our order was taken. Then they brought us our bowls of ramen, but forgot to bring spoons. We flagged down two different servers until we got them. When asking for extra napkins, the server literally gave that ""one"" person who asked for it, just one freaking napkin. How about extra napkins for everyone? Besides the horrible service, the food is exceptional. I ordered the combination(Ramen + donburi + salad) and it was delicious. Didn't realize how much food it was. I just wish they started accepting credit cards.",4
"Joining the legions of people who have eaten here, what can I say? Service is good. Space can be tight. It gets hot if you're seated towards the back near the kitchen. Has Kirin on draft. The house salad dressing is fantastic. Beyond the basics, I'm just going to add two things.First, if you aren't crazy about ramen, get the shredded pork bowl. I had it while my wife had the house special ramen, and I think my meal was far more delicious. I also had enough left over for another small meal later - good value. Second, a lot of the appeal of Daikokuya is the ambiance. It's an actual Japanese noodle house. It is not trying to be one or imitating one just because it's in Little Tokyo, it just is one. That's what brings people here and that's why I'll be back.",5
"Very good ramen. Got the spicy miso, I added more spice and ginger - was great. I'd come back again.",5
"So the need to try the other Daikokuya of Tokyo Town. It's a Saturday. We walked in and we were at #36. The last number called? #8. Wow. Tip. Across the street is the Japanese Village. Shopping is imperative. Those cute stuffs from the stores are worth buying! Tip. Do not forget your number. Go back to Daikokuya and check the crossed out numbers. Finally #36. We were seated by the bar area. We came here for the ramen,not for the table. Perfect ramen with that teriyaki eel bowl! The salad with their signature dressing is off the hook. Service and staff. They were attentive and anticipated my need for water refill. And they're real Japanese. Reasonable price.Park on the street with a minimum of 2 hours or at the parking structure of the Japanese Ville.",5
"I had been here couple times, each time coming here have to wait at least 30 minutes to an hour. Today is Monday, so not much people, we were seated right we walked in. Ordered their signature ramen, it is mediocre. I guess I still miss the ramen in Hawaii, hehe. Gyoza was good, big and a dollar for one. The waitress might have a bad day today, her face was all black all the t",3
"4 stars for this excellent ramen place. They get knocked off 1 star for two reasons how dirty the place looks and because the waitress wanted to take our plates before we were even done. We felt rushed! Anyways, we got there around 7:15p. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There was not a long wait maybe about 15-20 minutes. Not bad considering the amount of people saying they always have to wait over an hour.  I went with the usual Spicy Miso Ramen. They ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_brought the ramen like 5 minutes after...I added powdered garlic and powdered chili like always. The noodles were cooked right between hard and soft which was PERFECT for me. The soup was full of flavor and not bland at all. I must admit it had a weird smell but I tried not to smell it too much because I didn't want let that determine whether I liked it or not. I actually really liked it! I don't know if it's the best I've had but it is the one with the heaviest broth. The pork was really soft. It was so easy to chew and pull apart! I finished it all! I would come back again but I don't know if I'm willing to wait more than an hour for ramen... I guess you can always walk around Little Tokyo or people watch since the crowd that comes to this place is so different. You have hipsters, hippies, cool kids, business people, families all sorts of people.",4
"The quality of food here is better than the one on Sawtelle, and the ambiance is nicer too.I came here at 10:50 because they open at 11:00 (supposedly) and there was already a line forming. We didn't get seated until 11:15 but the waitresses were on top of it. Took our orders quickly, made sure we got our waters, and the food came out quickly too.I highly recommend the ramen combination, that way you can get a nice gigantic bowl of ramen that could easily be shared plus a small portion of their delicious rice bowls. Cheap and delicious.NOTE* park by home depot and grab yourself some coffee or yogurt after ur meal and get two hours free parking with validation",4
"OH MAN OH MAN!some good ramen!! this small ramen shop hit the spot for my ramen cravings over my vacation. although it's a tiny area, the wait wasn't too bad and the broth was on point!I'm definitely coming back for seconds!",5
"I am extremely disappointed in all you Yelpers who gave such high remarks to the Gyoza here. The meat filling is terribly disgusting and I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs... WTF?!! HUGE disappointment.The Daikoku ramen was mediocre, the soup base was bland. The only saving grace was the Tonkatsu and egg which was cooked to perfection.The chicken and egg on rice was not so bad but it wasn't worth writing home about.The Spicy Miso ramen was decent as the texture of he noodles were firm and the soup base was flavorful with some heat to it.The slaw salad had a creamy dressing that had some bite but not bad as long as your date doesn't mind the onion breath. The fried rice had the most flavor, although inconsistent as one scoop tastes well seasoned and the next is overly salted.Overall, I would not wait over an hour in line to eat here.",2
"Being from NYC, I'm used to extremely long wait times for food. Especially good food. So we arrived on July 4th weekend and there was no hostess, just a clipboard for you to write your name down. There was about 30 names ahead of us so I reasoned it should take an hour. The wait ended up being 1.5 hours and it was 2pm by then.Food was good, service was alright. We were asked to move in the middle of our meal so they could accommodate another party. Somewhat unprofessional, but understandable since they are so crowded. Get the cold ramen special if they still offer it! I would definitely go again if I get hungry at non-peak hours such as 12AM, otherwise I would say not really worth the wait.",3
"Okay let me preface this review by saying I think Daikokuya is a solid 4.5 stars and I came here after I had a large dinner earlier in the night and a bunch of filling beers at Angel City Brewery. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And it was STILL really really good.I came to LA for the first time last weekend to visit a friend who had moved for work, and honestly I was looking forward to three things for the trip: 1) seeing my friend (duh), 2) sunshine - it's been like two-pairs-of-pants-cold and dreary as hell in Chicago the last couple of weeks, and 3) tsukemen style ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Upon landing, changed at the airport into a sundress to give my sad, pale, winter-abused legs some freedom, I was ready for some damn sunshine and a lotta ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Given I've read a lot of reviews where the lines at Daikokuya can be at times horrifically long, we opted to make it the last spot in our travel adventures for the first day of the trip. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ate a VERY large dinner at a Chinese spot (in honor of Chinese/Lunar New Year of course), then grabbed some beers,and afterwards stumbled over to Daikokuya around midnight. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Even at midnight there was maybe five tables waiting in line in front of us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We waited maybe 30 minutes and were finally seated at a four-top near the front of the restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I already knew that I wanted to try the tsukemen, so I ordered it post-haste with a side of chili oil. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For all you LA folks who may not know, ramen is a big thing in Chicago, but we do not have tsukemen-style (dipping) ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So I was completely geeking out by the time they brought the ramen to the table.The broth was rich and super flavorful - not too salty either which I had been a bit worried about. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Concentrated down to nearly a sauce... perfect poised to cover the chilled noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles came on a separate plate with some bean sprouts, scallions, a whole egg (halved), and those amazing noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Thick, PERFECTLY chewy since the cooking had been suspended. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I dipped. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I slurped. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And then dipped and slurped some more. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ate everything despite not even being all that hungry when we arrived. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_IT WAS SO GOOD.To the owners of Daikokuya, if you've even daydreamed even for a split second about opening up a location in Chicago, you should seriously consider it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is a PERFECT spot for expansion given it is cold as balls like 8 months of the year and full of frozen Chicagoans ready for some hot ramen to defrost their sad souls. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And of course if you do bring your magical tsukemen ramen here, I will love you. Forever. And ever.",4

"If I could I would give this place no stars. Great food, idiot waitress. I still tipped her, she didn't deserve it. Never coming back!",1
"Ramen broth (tonkotsu) is super flavorful and creamy. Takoyaki here is pretty good here as well. Friendly waiters/waitresses, and quick service. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Only waited about 30 mins on a Saturday noon.",4
"First of all, check your tab because they charge tip for party of five.The place has a small AC unit and fans so it is not good idea to visit during 100+ heat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can put the name and shop across street.The ramen is good and ask for the fatty soup. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pot sticker is good with thick crispy bottom. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, it should be a great place during winter.",4
"Came here a long time ago, but haven't had the chance to return until recently. During our 45 minute wait, we went next door to Far Bar to grab a drink until our name was called. Upon seating, we were immediately given menus, and we both ordered the combos. I got the spicy miso ramen with salmon don, and my friend got the original daikokuya ramen with ikura don. We were first given a miso salad and soup to start off with, both which were good. Our ramen and dons arrived shortly after at the same time, and we quickly dug in. The spicy miso broth was much more rich and flavorful than the original daikokuya. We both enjoyed the spicy miso broth more, but both were good. The egg and chashu was also delicious, and the ramen itself wasn't too soft or too hard- it had the right consistency. The ikura and salmon were both fresh and tasted like quality, so no complaints there. Overall, a great meal if you don't mind waiting! Definitely one of the best in southern California. Can't decide if I like this or santouka better :0",5
Extremely decent ramen place. The ramen is exceptional as you could tell by the broth. The waiters are very friendly as they greet you in Japanese when you enter and when you exit. Noodles are soft and don't destroy at the touch of a chopstick. Overall great bowl of ramen with plenty of great sides that you can order.5/5,5
"I had been craving ramen since I landed in LA, so I decided to give Daikokuya a chance. Boy was it some of the best ramen I have ever had. The soup had a great creamy rich broth! You can't go wrong with it at all. The price is great for the amount of ramen you get. The service was good also. Just keep in mind you may wait awhile the place gets packed and don't forget to add your name to the wait list.  Overall loved the place and amazing ramen. Only complaint probably fix the decor.",4
"Came here on a Tuesday night and the wait was about 40 minutes, not too bad since the food came out almost immediately after we ordered! I only tried the ramen since I knew it was going to be super filling, which is was. The Daikoku ramen was very tasty, a bit on the salty side is the only complaint I have. The proportion is perfect. Will come back to try the other ramen and appetizers!",4
I came here because another Yelper was craving it and took me here and I can't understand why after my experience.First off this place is DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY. We were seated at a sticky bar next to a gaping hole between the counter and the wall that was filled with dirt. The whole restaurant looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years.The menu is extremely limited. They only offer a pork based Ramen. Either pork or spicy miso and I can't do spicy and I try my best not to eat pork for religious reasons.I ended up ordering the pork based ramen and I asked for a half portion with no meat and I only got noodles and scallions in my broth. They forgot my egg and that's the part I like the best.The wait here is long and I can't understand why. There's a ton of ramen places around the corner that looked cleaner and may have better food.,1
"I was EXTREMELY excited to try this place with my friend.We have both heard WONDERS about Daikokuya and couldn't wait to get food comaI was really lucky and found parking in front of the restaurant. They also have a parking lot across the place if someone's luck ran outSigned in on their wait-list and there was 6+ tables ahead of us.With worry, I asked the server how long it would take to get seated.She said 15 mins and I assumed this was a lie-- 6+ tables and a big bowl of noodles, how would this be possible?!With wonders, we were called within 10-15 minutes! I was soo esctatic.Ordered their ramen special and it arrived in about 5 mins. There wasn't as much green onions as I hoped so I paid 50cent for more on the side. We were both REALLY disappointed with the saltiness of the soup. The egg was raw in the middle as well- is it suppose to be like this?Nonetheles, I gobbled everything up- besides the soup.My friend touched 1/4 of it and stopped :/We prefer shen sen gumi",3
Love coming here. Spicy miso and regular flavored ramen is my favorite! Their spicy tuna roll is so good too!!,5
Bommmmmmb as duck ramen!!! Broth was delicious! Noodles were on point. Only giving four stars because I ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_had ordered the combination meal with the pork cutlet bowl and l was very disappointed with the bowl. Service was great tho. Line was long but definitely worth it. Will definitely come back !,4
"Went from $9 to $11 in 2 years.... :| but still the best, unless you're willing to go to sawtelle.The daikoku ramen with lottery (extra fat) is so amazing yum yum",4
"If they had a reception hall, id hold my wedding here. Had some sake, spicy ramen and a few beers. Great deal.",5
"I had good ramen here for lunch on a weekday. We were seated quickly and didn't wait long for our food. I ordered the daikokuya ramen with the recommended toppings and it was delicious. The broth, ramen and cha shu were great and filling. We had a spicy tuna sushi roll as an appetizer and that was good too. They did get our order a bit mixed up but it was not a big deal. I would come back again for their ramen.",4
"According to my husband, this was the best ramen that he has eaten. He had the Daikoku ramen with the eel rice bowl combo. Noodles were springy. Broth had the depth of flavor and wasn't too salty. The soft boiled egg was cooked to perfection.I had the regular size eel rice bowl. This was amazing! Eel is so expensive at the grocery story, so I had to order it for dinner. The bowl had a lot of rice and a whole piece of eel that was slightly grilled on top. Delicious.Yes, we waited 1 hour and 45 minutes to eat here on a Sunday evening. Service was okay. We sat in the bar, so we didn't get any refills for our drinks. Cash only place.",5
"Went here with co-workers after a great experience at another Ramen joint the previous weekend. I was told, this is the place to get amazing Ramen.Well it's all true, this place was amazing.We stopped in about 1:45pm on a Tuesday and put our name on the list. *Remember your #, not your name* 15 minutes later the 3 of us were seated in the back booth. It's a warm day outside, and it's warmer inside the restaurant. It's small, being 6'5"" it felt even smaller. Our server was quick to bring us our Kirin pitcher and off we went with 3 orders of Daikoku Ramen (Kotteri) Noodles were fantastic as is, didn't feel the need to ask for a different firmness. (but you can per request) The pork belly, egg, and green onions were my favorite part after the broth. Holy crap was this broth good! I didn't even care about eating hot Ramen on a hot day, in a hotter restaurant. Completely worth it.As good as this place is, and after reading some reviews, I would say it's worth a 45 minute wait max. If it was longer than that, I would have went to another Ramen place while sacrificing quality of course!Great place for a long lunch when your boss is out of the office for the day! :)",5
"So we were in Little Tokyo having just exited Japanese Village Plaza and were wandering amongst the tourist traps like the omiyage gift shop Ginza USA when we decided to have dinner. We crossed 1st street and saw about 20 or so folks milling about outside some business and that's when I saw the yellow awning and the characters for big black house (Ã…â€™___ÃƒË†Ãƒâ€¢Ã…â€™Ã‚Â¨_) a.k.a. Daikokuya. I had seen the name on all sorts of online short lists of the top ramen places in the US so those sexy kanji characters beckoned from the yellow awning the way that hyped-up vixen from the 80's, Angelyne, used to beckon from billboards all over L.A. We decided to wait it out and I got onto the waiting list and we then killed time in the nearby Family Mart - the only US location of the Japanese combini chain. We headed back after a while and it wasn't too long before our number came up. We were seated at the long bar facing the kitchen. CASH ONLY by the way... so I got the Daikokuya ramen - their flagship ramen. I got it with the added kotteri flavor. The wait was long to get in but once we ordered - things moved pretty quickly. I tried the broth first and indeed it was a really juicy and rich tonkotsu broth. The noodles and pork were delicious as well. The menma - wow! This isn't your mama's menma nor is it from a Momoya Menma jar like you can get from a place like Marukai - nope. This menma had a nice and crunchy texture and was very well seasoned. The restaurant itself was decorated with old movie posters and old advertisements for stuff like Oronamin C. Music that played while I was there was also a throwback to that time. Clientele seemed to be a lot of hipsters and tourists. On the website there is a poll asking where they should expand - one of the choices being San Diego. YES!!! PLEASE!!!PRETTY PLEASE!!! I would definitely return next time I'm in the area. Parking sucks of course - this time we came via metro rail so Little Tokyo station on the Gold Line is where we walked from. It's on 1st street right across from the Miyako Hotel. Worth the wait IMHO.",5
"Wasn't too long of a wait to get seated. But the restaurant is very small and not enough space to walk around. The decor was cute. Makes you feel like youre sitting on the streets having street food ramen. Different from a normal restaurant. I ordered the signature bowl of ramen. Very rich broth packed with flavor. Felt like I was getting s lot of food for what I was paying for which is nice. But my egg was a bit disappointing. Was expecting my smoked egg to be runny and yolky. Instead, it was a bit overcooked. Still good but not as good as I would have hoped it to be. The side salad that comes with the ramen is really good. That dressing is packed with flavor more so them the norm. My meal also came with a half size oyoko donburi. Perfect for my daughter to have a choice in rice or noodles for dinner. Really good and worth the price given how much food was given. Would definitely recommend to come back and there's free parking in the lot for the plaza for 2 hours! Better to park there then to pay meter parking",4
"Every year I go down to Los Angeles, Little Tokyo is a must destination, and every year I tell my family and myself that we will eat at Daikokuya. Every time, it never falls through. One of the main discouraging argument is the fact there is always a huge crowd of people in line to go in. But this time around, we finally did it. Since we went on a Monday, which is perfect because it was kind of cold, the waiting line is not that bad. With the size comparable to the authentic ramen places in Japan, it is clean, busy, cozy and definitely energizing. The steam from the pots and the kitchen beyond the bar counter will entice anyone who walks in. The side salad that came with our meal is simple and amazing good, and it's all because of their dressing. Creamy and tangy at the same time but not over powering at all, perfect with any crispy vegetable as a salad dressing. We ordered gyoza and takoyaki for appetizer. The gyoza was perfect. Crispy on the top, soft on the bottom and loaded with fresh green onions. The takoyaki though, is fried. Though I prefer my takoyaki coming from the takoyaki pan and grill, I won't hold it againts them. For the main course, my family and I decided that we would do the Special combination. Daikokuya Ramen with a small rice bowl. My mom got the Tempura Bowl that she devoured in a manner of minutes, while my brother and I got the Teriyaki Eel Bowl which is about the one of the best bowls I've had.Now for the ramen. The Daikokuya ramen that comes with the set combination, is really great. The broth is creamy and clean tasting, the noodles are firm. The combination of all the flavors with the tamago onsen, pork slices and heaps of green onions is a perfect combination. I did put some gari on my ramen thought.I must say, that with all the hustle and bustle of everyone working there and the customers' enthusiasm on the food, don't let your eyes decided for your stomach. The bowls are huge and the rice bowls are packed, we didn't even finish all of them. Overall, I'm in love with it. And yes, from now on I will be willing to wait to go in for another experience.",4
"Stopped by in the middle of the afternoon on a saturday hoping to avoid the massive line that is always formed in front of the building, and still had to wait a good half hour to get seated for a party of 3.Shared a bowl of ramen, and an order of gyoza.The ramen broth was good, without being excessively fatty compared to Ramen Yamadaya. The gyoza are hand made, but the skins were a bit chewy which stuck to my teeth. Mind blowing difference? i couldn't really make a definite decision compared to the other dozen good ramen shops in LA.",4
"DaikokuyaLA: Little Tokyo5pm Saturday 16th November 2013Four StarsI was shocked to find parking right in front of Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, I was more surprised by the parking meter costing $0.25 for 5 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was by myself so I skipped almost everybody in line and sat at the bar. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the Large Daikokuya Kotteri Ramen ($13.95), with the warning by the waiter that it was very big. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_5 minutes later, I was slurping up this giant steaming bowl of noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Broth was super thick with fat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Noodles were nicely cooked. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Soft Boiled Egg was salty and gooey. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Pork was dry but plentiful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered and ate a kaedama (noodle refill), just to prove to the waiter that his admonishment was entirely in vain. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was everything that I wanted before a long night of drinking.",4
I wanna forget this day foreverThis was the most horrifying experience everThe the classic ramen that I had was just grossI feel like throwing upI just came out of the restaurant I was there for like max 30 minutes I couldn't even eat itI'm shocked that they have like 6000 good reviews I'm shocked on those people Don't they have tastebuds ?!Sorry daikouya stuff But it is what it isI'm sorry for my $70 for 2 people and my ruined night because of the aftertaste,1
"The ladies that work here are rude and just ruin the experience. Their prices went up, a meal for 2 that I would spend $30 on went up to $40. Don't waste your time",1
Really good ramen amongst really great ramen. A good place to kill your craving. The wait is usually quite long if you come after noon.,5
"Service was okay, atmosphere was good, and the food was also good. On vacation and needed the salt fix. And of course ramen hits the spot always. We got the Daikokuya ramen and the spicy miso ramen and they both hit the spot. We did need to wait 45 mins for a table for two so you should expect to wait.",4
"This really isn't the best ramen in LA. Even a lot of posts on face book said so. The wait is long for the weekend, about an hour wait. Parking is difficult since it's in the little Tokyo. Ramen is just whatever compare to other ramen places. Shin sen gumi has better ramen, or even the Tatsu ramen on melrose.",2
"So this place is located in the Little Tokyo Area, and it's quite a small shop. When I came there were a bunch of people outside and the wait list seemed quite long. We ended up waiting like 1-2 hours I believe before getting in, so there was a very long wait for us.I think this had to do more with the fact that we had a party of 3, because I saw that the parties of 1-2 got in relatively quickly. I think it has to do with how there is a counter area near the ramen, which can seat a bunch of individuals pretty easily, but when you have larger parties you need to sit at the booths (or that's how I think it works based on what I saw). Either way I don't feel the wait is worth it, so if I came back I would probably try to be in a party of 1-2 people.The ramen was pretty good, I got the Daikokuya Ramen, with koterri, which means they use the back fat to make the ramen richer. I liked how the egg was still a little bit runny in the middle, the flavor of the ramen was rich, and the noodles were well cooked. However, I don't feel this ramen was worth the hype or the wait, it was good but not nearly as good as I felt people were making it out to be.Overall I would probably be back if I was in the area and the wait wasn't too long, but I doubt I'd make a trip out specifically just for the ramen.",4
"The trick is to come 15 - 20 minutes before opening. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And if you miss the first round, you're not that screwed because people eat ramen fast.I love it here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The dipping version is spectacular; the hiyashi chuka is amazing and comes with avocado!There is nothing more to say expect park in the Aiso garage on Judge John Aiso Street for $1 and hour for the first two hours. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Or you can find a meter for $3 an hour. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Up to you.",5
"My first time being here and all I have to say is that this place is the bomb! I got the spicy ramen, the broth is to die for!! I don't usually eat the pork slices that comes with it, but the pork slices is so soft, tender and melt in your mouth. Come early soYou don't have to wait in line.",5
"Love hole in the wall ramen places! And this is definitely one of em. Tiny little place, but it was just wonderful. I was in debate whether to get the spicy miso ramen or the kotteri ramen..... The dilemma!Finally decided on the spicy miso ramen! Also, with eyes bigger than my stomach, I had to order the combo with the pork cutlet bowl.. Pork cutlet bowl came out steaming hot. Pork was moist and the sauce and egg on the rice was sweet and salty. Tried not to eat so much to save my stomachThe spicy miso ramen was good! The broth was rich and not too salty and the noodles retained its chew. Only cons were that it was on the oily side, not that spicy, and it was only warm, not that hot for what ramen should be. Overall, I enjoyed the ramen, but I must come back to try the kotteri!",4
Now I have seen the beauty of excellence of ramen making. Although be prepared to wait a long time but it is well worth it. Tip would be to put name down and go shopping or bars next door. Should you miss your spot and come back they put you on top of list! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen is amazing PERIOD. Regardless of the negative reviews here. I can now say that I am on the bandwagon of Daikokyu.,5
"I'm walking around little Tokyo looking for some breakfast and BOOM, there's a line outside some closed restaurant. Since my first choice to eat was also not opened yet, i decided to try this cute little place.As soon as the doors opened it felt like i was walking into an old Japanese Naria type place where the door/portal took me back in time.Nevermind the amazing cozy atmosphere. The biggest Tonkatsu pork cutlet i've ever seen is sitting right in front of me. So tender, so juicy so... homey. I felt like a runaway Japanese school boy from WWII taking comfort in the Japanese soul food mom used to make.Wait a moment.. I'm not Japanese. My mom doesn't even cook. I'm in Los Angeles. Not Nagasaki.But how? This Matcha green tea tastes so pure and true for it to be from LA (or America for that matter).No, waiter. I do not want the check yet. Please let me live in my nipponese safespace in peace.",5
Friendly staffs and delicious food. I will come back if I ever visit LA again. It can get busy if you visit during comiccon.,5
"Lunch on Tuesday, 5/12/15Every time I visit Daikokuya in Little Tokyo, there is a line. It just depends on how long the wait would be. It took about 40 minutes for our party of 5. The restaurant is a bit small but it's cozy with lots of decorations. They also have bar seating for a smaller party. As soon as we got seated, the servers came by to assist us.We have all been here before so we knew what to order. She took our order and also brought us water. After about 10 minutes, our food was ready. Since it's usually busy, we tried to have a quick lunch to free up the table and also to get back to work.There are other Daikokuya locations but this one seems to be the most crowded. I'm assuming the broth tastes better here than elsewhere. Be sure to arrive early and put your name down on the waiting list.",4
"Not a huge fan of ramen, but this places pretty good. A little Salty for my liking though.",3
"The absolute best ramen in DTLA and 2nd best I've had, ever. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The only downside is the small space and the long lines. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The cozy unpretentious atmosphere is really endearing, it seems to signify that this place doesn't thrive on image but strictly on the quality of their food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My go to is tonkatsu ramen, which was really rich, fatty and flavorful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles are perfect. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_No complaints.",5
"We arrived at 3PM and the wait was still ~30 minutes.Besides the wait, this place is a gem in lil Tokyo. The spicy miso and pork broth were both really good. the noodles were perfectly firm. The eggs are really well done. I got two eggs with my ramen, and one of them was more cooked than the other one, so that's the only imperfection. I'd go here more if I lived close by.",5
"This has been one of the best ramen I have ever ate in my entire life. The first time I tried this Ramen it was Heaven, the noodles was delicious, the pork was so tender and juicy, the broth was so flavourful, and the employees are kind and awesome. I can't wait to get some more next time.",5
"We came here on a Tuesday night and waited almost 45 minutes! I wasn't too impressed once I tried the ramen. Yes, the broth is creamy and the meat is so soft, but I find it to lack some flavor and missing something. I also had their shredded pork rice bowl and it was good, but nothing mindblowing.I do think that they have excellent customer service though! Other than that, I was a little disappointed.",3
Whenever I'm in Los Angeles I never failed to come here. The long wait is worth it. Try the ramen in koteri.,4
"Recommend by my friends who didn't want to overhype this place, we ordered 4 bowls of the infamous daikoku ramen and love all parts of it. My sister loved the noodles, I love the broth, my friends loved he pork and eggs. All the ingredients worked together so well that it was a perfect combination of saltiness, savory, sweetened, and good flavors. We also ordered the takoyaki and edamame. They were okay. Come here for the ramen and nice friendly service. We came on a busy Sunday but manage to get seated together in two booths when we asked. Only con was the waitress would come in and grab your bowl when she thought you were done with it even though you weren't and was pacing ourselves. Still worth it.",4
"Yessss. I came here on a monday at 5:30 pm and actually waited the 45 minutes for a table and am sure glad that I did. Before we even sat down, I knew what I wanted just from looking at the pictures and reviews. We got the most popular Daikoku Ramen and a pork belly rice bowl. 2 of the best dishes I've probably ever had. Also ordered Gyoza which was honestly unbelieveable! everything was great and if I were to come back, I would order the same items.",5
"Daikokuya is just good, not great. There isn't much to complain about (except maybe the line), but it doesn't push the boundaries into 5-star territory when it comes to taste.The ramen is a decent bite to eat, but doesn't blow me away. Just in Los Angeles, I've had better (Tsujita comes to mind).Expect a line! It starts before the place opens.",4
"I am an authentic ramen addict. I saw this place had more than 4000 good reviews so I was like whaaat?! I had to check it out when I was in LA. I got my hair cut in Japan town then went to eat ramen. That doesn't sound too right, does it? I ain't Japanese. Yea, who cares. Anyways, this place was pretty small and it was packed so i had to wait a little while but it actually wasn't that bad. I don't think they take credit cards so make sure you have cash moneyyy. I ordered a bowl of daikoku ramen and an eel rice bowl. OMG, they were sooo good!! The ramen broth was very rich and the toppings were superb. If you don't already know, I LOVE eel!!! The eel rice bowl was sooo delicious! I can't remember how much I spent since it has been awhile. But I think the price was very reasonable. I will definitely return when I visit LA.Cali peeps are so spoiled! Have to move there soon just for the food!!!",5
"Ok, not to dump on the nearly 6k reviews... And I'm sure that more than half the world already has their view on this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But here we go...Been here a bunch of times over the years, and now it is time to pay tribute to the place that changed my view on Ramen forever. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Circa 2008. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For me a good ramen place accomplishes the following:-has no real formula but has a pronounced identity.-provides a unique experience that captures you in a depth of flavor.-makes you want more, (but your stomach will never forgive you for eating 2 bowls in a session).There have been a few ramen places to tingle the cockles of my heart, and Daikokuya is definitely one of them: (other notables are Wasabi, Chicago - Ippudo, New York - Totto, New York)My typical meal includes Daikoku Ramen and Gyoza. ::DAIKOKU RAMEN::That homey, hearty, creamy, and absolutely delicious broth... ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_*Drool wipe* ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is nothing else like it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Imitators beware, this broth is no joke. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Add the perfect firmness of the noodles soaking all of that goodness up. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Top it off with freshly cut green onions, soft boiled egg, and a healthy portion of pork belly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Wow. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_::GYOZA::I am a dumpling ho, fosho. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But these babies are unique in that they are fried together with some wonton/egg crust. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This technique produces a flaky, crispy treat that is always a delightful start to the meal.The only tips I would give is DO NOT come here during peak hours of lunch/dinner unless you have nothing to do and are in a pure ramen-fiending mode. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait can be bananas. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Also, CA$H ONLY. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_See you next time I visit LA, Daikokuya.",5
"It took me such a long time to finally try this place, because it's so popular. Daikokuya has hour long waits for a reason. I came here right after work one day with friends so we wouldn't have to wait. Their ramen is perfectly cooked, with a delicious egg and finely chopped green onions. The broth is delicately balanced and the pork is nice and tender with a little fat. This is seriously a bowl of happiness that I cannot wait to eat again!",5
"Call me crazy but the ramen here was not a life changer. Maybe my lust for ramen has been fake all my life? Well I'm glad I went here after so many years of thinking my life isn't complete without trying this place once. I probably won't return since ""tourists"" line outside the door before the restaurant opens.I'd rather go somewhere else like maruya or shin sen gumi where the food is about the same and no wait.So onto the food I had the spicy miso ramen which lacked flavor. The good part is that the noodles were cooked perfectly. Slightly al dente which is the way I like it. Their cabbage and white miso dressing is pretty good but after awhile is too rich for me This place is way to overhyped. If there is an off chance that I am passing by, hungry and there is no wait I might consider returning...",3
"I always come here whenever I make a trip to LA from San Francisco. There's ALWAYS a long wait because everyone is dying to taste their oh so flavorful ramen. My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday around 7:00 and the line wasn't too bad for once! I found it surprising that this other Japanese restaurant right next door had a even longer line than Daikokuya. The hostess was a nightmare. My boyfriend asked her how long would the wait be. She mumbled and said ""not sure... I have to check"". Hmm.. check? You're the hostess. Shouldn't you know...? Anyways, we decided to wait in front of the restaurant because we didn't want to miss our names being called. If you want to venture out, you can go across the street and walk around the Japanese Plaza to kill time. The one thing I would say though was the hostess didn't go in order for the wait list. She'll call your name once and if you are not there, she'll put down ""called"" right next to your name. If you're not there the second time, you're out of luck. After 30 mins, I decided to check on the wait list and she marked ""called"" next to my name. Mind you, I was waiting in front and I didn't hear anything. So I went to the hostess and she gave me the next free table. Personally, I didn't think it was fair for the people who were still waiting and they were ahead of me too. But whateverrrr hahaI got the Daikokuya ramen. The soft boiled egg that came with it was pure perfection. The broth was light but really flavorful! The noodle is so good too. It literally melts in your mouth with the juicy broth. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Oh, and it's cash only too.",4
"Not sure what the hype is. We waited just about 40 minutes but others before us waited nearly 2 hours! (Advice: don't come in a large group if u want to be seated in a timelier manner). We were a party of 2.I had higher expectations for food in LA, particularly ramen in little Tokyo. But it doesn't top ramen dojo in San Mateo, ramen shop in oakland, or Ippudo in NYC. It was good, but not amazing. Noodles were good but I felt broth lacked some rich flavor I was hoping for.Do yourself a favor, come right before opening or come really late and u might land a seat fairly quickly. But don't come starving.",3
"I have been to Daikokuya 3 times in the past week and all were fantastic except for last night. All of the food we ordered was bland and flavorless which is extremely abnormal. Usually Daikokuya's ramen and fried rice and absolutely packed full of flavor, unfortunately this time was lacking. Oh well. I will still frequent this establishment.",2
"We planned to go elsewhere for lunch, however, ramen just sounded really good too. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Second lunch! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Our local friend told us that there's always a wait so we decided to go put our name down before heading to the first place for food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When we got there, I realized 'Oh, Daikokuya!' because it was on my list to try and never got around to it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_An hour or so later, we returned at the perfect time because they almost had a table for us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We were already content from the first meal so it was nice that they had half-size portion of the the Daikokuya Ramen, which is tonkotsu-based ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was flavorful and not too salty or rich. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was worth the wait and one of the better tonkotsu that I had in awhile. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Don't forget to bring cash.",4
Long wait. I was very disappointed at the Ramen. The broth is only mediocre and the pork belly is below average. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Fried rice is dry and boring. Not worth the long wait.,2
"This is definitely my spot. I think I must have been here about 50 times by now and I'm finally writing a review. The ramen just doesn't get old. I've tried other places but always come back to where it all began. So whenever I come here I always get the ramen. Always. Get the combo with a side dish. I used to get the shredded pork bowl but now I get the beef bowl. Both are good but my friend sticks to the chicken Teri Bowl. The ramen is amazing. The first thing I usually finish is the broth. Get your pork grilled, it makes the broth taste so much better. The broth is pork based so this place is definitely not for light eaters. The bowl is huge but they do offer a smaller size just in case you aren't up for the challenge. They also have a bigger size in case you're brave enough. The wait time is horrible. But hey I'm not going to take any stars away for that. It comes with the territory. Good food will bring lots of people in. Come early on a week day if you don't want to wait. Anytime past 4 and you're looking at at least a 50 minute wait. Less if you're lucky. Overall this place has never disappointed me. The ramen is always the same. Delicious. If you're thinking about it, do it. This might become your spot too. **You can ask for Kotteri broth, which is basically the same broth that they use but with extra pork in it. I wouldn't recommend it for your first time but it's still delicious. Just a stronger taste. **The ramen has a good amount of scallions, those chopped up onion shoots. So in case someone doesn't like them there's your heads up. I love them in mine. Also the side dish bowls that come with the ramen come with ginger. I don't like it. Maybe you do. Again, just a heads up. Enjoy. :)",5
7/2/2016 - Tried the kotteri (back fat) addition to the broth and it was delicious!!!! Makes me love daikokuya even more!,5
"Food came out fast, and it was very good. The broth was was very flavorful and I enjoyed it. My brother suggested the light fat option son may try that if I go back. The noodle was firm and I enjoyed the texture! Overall would recommend!",4
My favorite place of all time to get ramen. I've tried other places but they are just not as amazing as this place is ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_highly recommend this place if it's your first time trying ramen,5
Pretty good ramen. I enjoyed the broth for the spicy miso pork. The noodles themselves weren't the best I have ever had but definitely loved the flavor of it all. Also they have some good spicy tuna rolls.,4
Best ramen I have ever had in my life!!! Be expected to wait in line for about an hour but it's definitely worth it. Very authentic and the broth is so full of flavor! I wish they had one around my area but since it's so good I don't even mind the drive.,5
The ramen is good here.The only thing I didn't like is that you have to wait a while to be seated.,3
I ordered the cold ramen. Wait was approximately 45 minutes. I ate near the kitchen and ordered the cold ramen. Service was very prompt. I haven't ate at too many ramen places but I just heard that daikokuya is super popular. I'm pretty sure that there is better ramen out there.,3
"This is my kind of ramen house! The staff here is friendly and super efficient. By friendly, I mean Asian hole-in-the-wall friendly. They'll greet you and get you what you need, but they're not gonna ask you how your day was or what you do for a living. My husband and I waiting in line for about 40 minutes, but considering how many people were waiting in line, it went by pretty quickly. The turnaround time was really good.The food is delicious, portions are generous, and the fish (we ordered a tuna roll) was fresh. My only experiences with Japanese ramen have been in the States, but my biggest peeve with with soups in general is when they are not served piping hot. Not the case with Daikokuya! The broth was so hearty. Finally, the crowd was super eclectic and the location is close to plenty of other bars and attractions.",4
"Overhyped? Yes. The broth is good, rich and flavorful. It's even better when you get the kotteri. Worth the 1.5+ hour wait for 2? No, thanks.Orenchi in Norcal (not nearly as long a wait) has better Tonkotsu ramen. The noodles here were good, but that's about it. The egg was over-boiled, making it really hard, not runny as a soft boiled egg should be. The ratio of noodles to meat and veggies was weird. I felt I got way too much noodles compared to the thin slice of chashu and lack of toppings. However, I will add that the kotteri broth makes a huge difference. It leads to an even thicker, creamier consistency that's bursting with porky flavor.If I was nearby and there was no wait, I'd give this place another shot. I would not go out of my way and wait in a ridiculous queue for the ramen though.Lastly, not sure if the AC was out that day i went, but holy mother, it was scorching inside!! Contrary to popular belief, eating hot ramen in hot, humid weather is not the shiz. I swear we weren't the only ones sweating our butts off and fanning ourselves with the menu every chance we got. Everyone in there was dripping sweat! What's the deal with that?",3
"This ramen place is soooooo good! The only thing I had while I was here was their ramen noodles, so I can't speak for any of the other dishes. Their soup base is very strong and flavorful, and has its own unique taste. The place itself is pretty small, and often times there are long lines, so don't expect to be immediately seated. Definitely more of a casual and quick restaurant, a great place to bring your friends/family!",5
"Daikokuya in L.A. is comparable to both NYC's Tabata and Minca combined. Of course, if I had to choose between the three, I'd pick Daikokuya in a heart beat. The three simple specialty ramen creations, namely Daikoku, Spicy Miso and Tsukemen, are enough to keep foodies and enthusiasts coming back, whether it's the classic-famous tonkotsu flavor, spicy miso taste or dip-style pork broth. Besides ramen, the experience is not complete without trying a few appetizers or rice bowls. The combo options are the best way to get the most for your tummy and your wallet. One of my favorite combos to go with Daikoku or Spicy Miso ramen is the Ikura bowl (a mound of salmon eggs/roe over rice). When mixed thoroughly with wasabi and soy sauce, and devoured between ramen and rice, the change in texture and taste is out of this world. Well, as many will tell you, remember to bring CASH, come hungry and wait. It's all part of the journey to trying good stuffs and this is no exception.",5
"After reading the reviews on Yelp and also great recommendation from other Yelp Elite member... it is time to check out LA #1 Ramen at Daikokuya!!Since they don't take reservation and the seating is sooo limited. I have decided to have ""late lunch"" or ""early dinner"" at 4pm!Yelpers are right... there is ALWAYS a wait line at Daikokuya~ I am seated in approximately 20 minutes!! How lucky I am~The Service: Very efficient~ The staffs know there is always customers waiting for table. They turn over the table in seconds. The moment you sit down, they are ready to serve you! The food is served very quickly and the staffs are very attentive (even they are sooo busy). 5 stars for sure!!The Food: Of course have to order the Daikokuya Ramen with KOTTERI version~ OMG!!! When the ramen is served... I can see the pork FAT floating on top of the soup!! YUMMM~ When I drink the soup... NOT greasy at all!! The flavor is unbelievable~ The noodle has great texture, cook to perfection. Even the egg is so tasty, not an ordinary hard boiled egg. The slices pork meat in the soup... with a little bit of fat with it. Sooo tender!! YES, I finish the bowl of ramen by myself including all the soup!! I have instant food comma right away... but it is so worth it!!The Parking: Always challenge to find street parking in Little Tokyo. But you can definitely find parking structure for $4-$5 all day.",5
"Loved the eel, Ramen was amazing. The pork is so soft and flavorful, the broth is a nice milky (I know that's kind of a gross descriptor but didn't know how else to describe the color) consistency showing they really know how to cook their broth. Everything is flavorful with a nice umami punch and service was good (we were pretty much the only ones there). Even my dad, who likes nothing, thought it was tasty.",5
"Good lord... With all the praise you'd think this were the best ramen in all of Southern Cali. Had high hopes but right as we sat towards the back of the restaurant we started complaining about the stinky skunky toe jam funk in the air which wasn't apparent towards the front half of the restaurant. If anything, avoid sitting near the back. As soon as our bowl of ramen arrived it was clear, that was it. I was quite embarrassed and afraid of nearly vomiting in the bowl as I grew super nauseous from the aroma. It wasn't pleasant whatsoever. It did taste slightly better than it smelled, but the broth was terrible imo as I couldn't eat it by the spoonful. If you've ever worked in a kitchen setting as a cook you might be familiar with the scent of super dirty rags ~ that's exactly what the ramen smelled like!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Or like pigs rolled in shit. Or like pig intestines filled with shit being boiled with those pork bones. @#$&amp;*@!!!!!!!!!! Oh wait, it wasn't pig shit after all, it was those fermented bamboo shoots which filled the broth with unnecessary funk. Regardless, it was beyond repulsive. Think slightly tolerable version of stinky tofu. GAG. And this is coming from someone who thinks fermented Cantonese salted fish is tasty! I would highly recommend Silverlake Ramen as my top choice for super hearty delicious clean Tonkotsu broth, and Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi as my second fave. Or head to Robata Jinya, JINYA Ramen Bar in the Mid Wilshire area. They've even got a location in Studio City if you live out there. A gazillion times better than this crap. This has by far been the worst.Oh, and their pork cutlet also sucked beyond belief. Super soggy wet skin covered in excessively sweet sauce. All so bad.",1
"Prepare to wait for an hour !! Wanted to try this ramen because of all the amazing reviews it had but to be honest, this place is just overhyped. Bf &amp; I got the daikoku ramen. I thought the pork was really tasty. The ramen was good, but not omg sex in your mouth good. It wasn't worth the hour wait and I've definitely had better ramen back where I'm from in NorCal and this place definitely doesn't top Ippudo in NYC.",3
"Came to their Little Tokyo branch for lunch with my coworkers. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Reasons I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5:Food Quality: 5Food was excellent. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered their spicy miso ramen, which seemed to be very popular among other slow cooked pork broth soup base options. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All of their ramen come with special Japanese egg, seaweed, and sesame paste. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We also ordered 2 sides, a tofu and tonkatsu, which was a very crispy, fried, breaded pork fillet that was served with rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Waiting time: 3It was lunch hour, so I did expect it to be busy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, the host was not very good with seating customers in an organized fashion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was very clear that some parties only had 1 or 2 people, where the host would mark them for the # of people present, but then 3-5 more guests would appear and seating was rearranged to suddenly accommodate for the larger party. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Had I known I would wait 30 minutes to be seated, I would have gone elsewhere. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food came quickly, but our lunch was very rushed in order to get back to work on time.Noise: 4Again, it was lunch hour, but this place was incredibly loud. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Much louder than their Arcadia branch I had previously had dinner at.Overall, very good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just be sure to get there early before the lunch rush.",4
I came here on a double date about a week ago and I was really hyped up to try the spicy miso soup. I'm gonna be honest it wasn't bad but I was expecting a little more with all the good reviews and such. The portions there are pretty big. The soups are about $12 and I had to share with my partner because it was so much. Overall I enjoyed coming here and it would recommend it for anyone who wants to try ramen/miso,4
"When a place has nearly 6,000 reviews, I'm less motivated to write one because everything has probably already been said. But since I'm in a review-writing mood, here's my 2 cents.The noodles are more thick and curly than I prefer, but still pretty good because they're on the hard side. Not soggy or soft at all. Their broth and egg is good too. We ordered the fried rice which is made with pieces of pork. The pork wasn't great (had a strong taste), but the rice itself had great flavor. The California rolls were standard - nothing to rave or complain about.The only thing I don't like about this place has already been mentioned by other reviewers and that's that it's rundown and pretty dirty. I would also hate to be seated at the bar because the table there is so narrow and close to the wall that you will likely bump your head as you lean forward to eat your noodles.",4
This was a huge disappointment. The wait was about 1.5 hours but the ramen was only okay. It wasn't a bad ramen but it is way over hyped. The broth doesn't have a ton of flavor. To me it's the equivalent of a very average bowl of ramen. Maybe the lines make people say it's very good but I think it's only okay. We did have the gyoza which were delicious and I recommend.,3
"Was getting up to leave a tip and a waitress swoops by to remind us that the tip isn't included in the bill. I tell her I understand and that my party is collecting a tip for the resturant as she was speaking. She proceeds to ask for the tip and blocks the aisle as if she was making sure we couldn't be able to leave without leaving her a tip. Very disappointed in the way they have trained this worker. You should never beg for tips and should always respect the customer's decision to tip or not tip you. Tip is earned not asked for. Additionally, she was not the one waiting on our table. I find this very rude and desperate. If service was better I would have given this place a second shot. Sad to say that the a poorly trained worker with a terrible attitude and rude manners ruined my party's experience at what could have been a great resturant.",1
"1st time here on a Sat and waited almost 2 hours but the food was worth every frightening bum encounter while waiting in line. Someone next to me barfed a gallon of mystery liquid on the gold line &amp; one of said bums (completely unprovoked) aggressively told me he would ""cut me right in the face"", but this ramen made me take back my vow to never come back to downtown LA.",5
"Ramen! I felt as excited as Naruto at the prospects of eating ramen, but not any ramen, but ramen from Daikokuya. I came here once last year and it was one of the best ramen I've had- the broth was just the right flavor, the pork slowly melts in your mouth and not to mention the bigger than normal portion size here! So I knew I would have to bring my family here to try it. We came right after we landed on a Thursday around 3pm and surprisingly, we were first on the wait list. It was about a 15-20 min wait and we took that time to explore the menu so that we can order right away (we were all starving at this point). Even though I knew the ramen portion sizes was enough to fill all of us up, I convinced my mother to order the combo with me (her getting the fried rice while I got the chicken &amp; egg). Salad came out first and I forgot how tasty the dressing was (tuna + house special sauce). The ramen came out with my mother and I getting the house special while my brother got the spicy ramen. We were all impressed! It was as tasty as I remembered it and we were stuffed after finishing our ramen that we hardly touched our side orders. The fried rice and chicken &amp; egg was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The only problem is that immediately after, we were all extremely dehydrated. I think the broth might be too salty? Not sure, but I would still come back the next time I'm in LA.",4
"LOOOVE daikokuya. Their noodles are perfectly chewy and not mushy. Their broth is to die for. It's always ALMOST too salty but not. Their daikokuya ramen comes garnished with chashu, some pickled ginger, and green onion I believe. The little house salad that comes before the ramen is pretty good too. It's has bits of shredded cabbage with this thousand island-esque dressing. They also have good kara-age (fried chicken) as well. The space is really cramped though, as they tried to fit as many booths in as humanly possible with a narrow bar too. Needless to say, it's always packed and loud. And always delicious. Definitely worth the wait imo. Parking can get a little tricky though because it's downtown la.",5
"Absolutely amazing broth. The wait was about an hour but totally worth it. I got the kotteri which is the richer broth. Chashu was amazing and the noodles were perfect! Next time I'm in DTLA, I'll be coming back!",5
Was a recommendation from a friend who told me how popular it was and how good the food was. I had a tuna a salmon poke bowl and it was delicious. The service is impeccable and so super friendly. New favorite spot.,5
Great ramen. Maybe the cold 45 minute wait outside have a little to do with it as you savor the nice warm seasoned broth from the big ramen bowl they serve you.Just come prepared...you can probably do a few things out in Little Tokyo while you wait for your table or at the counter. They have Japanese beer here too. Cash only.,4
"Ate here for dinner with my cousins. Put our names on the waiting list on #36, and they were still on #21. It probably took us an hour to get seated.Worth the wait? Not really. Not much to say, but I ordered the Daikokuya and it was good. Not terrible, but not jawdropping either. A-OK indeed. I'll give it that I liked the creamy and flavorful broth, but I wish there were more bamboo shoots up in my bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'd prefer Orenchi Ramen (back in the Bay Area in Santa Clara) over this place, but that place has one hell of a wait also. Once I find a ramen spot with the quality of Orenchi but can seat people faster, I'll award that place with 5 stars. Oh, and I guess an added bonus to my average eating experience was the homeless man who abruptly walked in and started asking people for money. I used to live and currenlty work in San Francisco where there's a sh*tload of homeless people and I've never even seen anything like that happen before. Got super quiet and awkward in the restaurant and it was a little amusing watching the two Asian waitresses gain the courage to kick him out. And yup, they were able to. Cheers to that!",3
Can I say yum?! This is probably one of the best ramen places I've been to. It beats any of the places I've gone to in NYC. I've been to a lot. The daikoku broth is full bodied and complex. Tastes like those chicken and pork bones have been stewing all day. Noodles have a great bite to it too. I like the option of being able to order a half or full portion although for a few bucks difference might as well get the big girl bowl. Be prepared for a line no matter what time of day and cash only. I would definitely be back!,4
"I went there yesterday for lunch with a Japanese friend of 60 years who was, and still is, a doyenne in the Sawtelle/Little Osaka community. We both had the daikoku ramen which we both thought was delicious. Her comments were that the broth was really good and very complex and the noodles and egg were both perfectly cooked. I thought so as well but she truly knows what she's talking about. That delicious ramen was $9.95, why there are 2 $$ in their price rating is beyond me. Can their be a better meal ANYWHERE for $10? If so I hope I find it.",5
"Super super authentic Japanese cuisine! The Ramen is to die for, and their homemade gyoza is a treat, as homemade gyoza are pretty hard to find here!!",5
Came by for dinner the other night. The wait for a seat by the counter was ~20 minutes.The interior of the restaurant was very hot w/ fans throughout...Started off with the gyoza and it was okay.Moved on to the Daikokuya ramen w/ kotteri sauce. ...the broth was way too fatty... The noodles were decent as they were al dente. The hard boiled egg was over-cooked... The char siu was okay.The unagi bowl was also okay. The unagi was fatty but there were minor bones and scales at the end... The rice was also dry and burnt...Cash only.~$22/head after tax and tip.,3
I don't know what else to say besides everything about this ramen was on point. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Go here if you don't want to be let down by ramen.,5
"I will say the egg was good. That is it though. Wow I've been meaning to come here for 4 years now. Finally made it and it was. TOTAL letdown. This has to be the most overrated dining experience in Los Angeles. The broth was bland the noodles were whatever and the pork was actually kinda gross and off. I don't know nothing about this place impressed me. The food alone made me never want to come back but compile that with the long waits and the cash only policy and this place is 100% skipable. Go to Men Oh around the corner it's far, far better.",2
"This place is pretty good. With all the hype of how good this place is, the long hours waiting in line just to be seated is pretty worth it. I came here hungry as a bear, and left filled to capacity with some to go. The restaurant itself is quite small. There are some booths to the left when you enter and a bar seating to the right. Small and quaint and the response is quite quick. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was just the wait that people dread. I came here before noon, around 11ish, and we still had to wait for about 15 minutes. By the time we left, there was a line out the door already.We go to the combination meal that came with the Ramen and a choice of rice bowl. I had the spicy miso Ramen which is an extra $.45 but it was worth it. On the side I also had the salmon bowl. It wasn't anything special, it was just salmon on top of rice. I should've gotten the fried rice. That was a bit tastier. Though I do have to admit, the salmon was buttery and quite tasty. I think I was just too full from the Ramen to fully enjoy the texture and the taste of the salmon. Speaking of the Ramen being full, it is a giant ginormous bowl. I thought it would be a little bit smaller since it was a combination meal, but no, it was a full size bowl. I am usually quite the eater, I will finish my Ramen bowls usually. I would go to town on all you can eat KBBQs, but for some reason I could not finish this bowl. It was just that filling. It had the usual noodles, two slices of tender pork, bean sprouts on the side, some bamboo shoots, green onion for decoration and flavoring, and of course an egg. In total, the combination meal came with the crunchy cabbage salad, the ginormous bowl of spicy miso Ramen, and a side of salmon sashimi bowl came to be about $15 and change rounded up to $16. This meal is a very shareable meal. I would definitely come back here before the lunch rush, in between lunch and dinner rush, and probably on a weekday just to avoid the crowds.",4
"This is my staple ramen spot when I go to LA. The ramen is the best I've ever had. I got the spicy ramen and gyoza the last time I came and have been dreaming about it since. Sapporo on draft to wash it down. Love this place. It's small but it's worth the wait. We came on a Friday night around 7:30 and waited about 15 minutes. We were sat at the bar, which I can't complain about because you're coming for the food, not to hang out.",5
This has the best ramen in LA that I've had so far. It's definitely worth the wait. I've had ramen in Japan and this comes pretty close. Service is good for ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_a place this busy and small. I've ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_been here many times and I've never encountered bad service. I highly recommend this place! But plan ahead when you come cause there is always a wait. Best time to come is noon. Evening and weekends you may be waiting an hour or longer.,5
"The wait was about a little over an hour for us when we came here at 4 PM on a Saturday. We ordered the Daikoku Ramen with the small ikura bowl and the tsukemen soup. The food was good except for the fact that we found a piece of hair buried in our salad. Was a little disappointing since that made us lose our appetite a bit. Overall food was good except for the piece of hair, but I don't think the wait was worth it.",3
This ramen is pretty normal and charges for a lot and I don't get why people line up for it. If you have eaton the Kinton ramen you would understand what I am saying. Especially I have to say the service is bad and the attitude is bad. Lastly. The waitress asked for the tips when I already have about 1.5 dollars tips inside and she said that wasn't enough. I want to say the tips are not mandatory.it doesn't worth the money and the time,1
"It's Friday, the work week is done, and you just a bit to eat with your coworkers. That is how it usually goes down, and I have to say, Happy Hour isn't in our best interest. Some how, some way, we always end up at Daikokuya. That is officially our go to spot. Someone suggests that we grab some dinner after work and ideas start floating in the air -- happy hour, burgers, a new restaurant, a quick bite in Koreatown. After a nice hour of indecisiveness, we decided! And no, it wasn't Daikokuya. We were headed to our destination, which was actually in Little Tokyo. We found parking instantly right in front of Daikokuya (by fate), and we noticed that there was no line. The one time we decide not to go to Daikokuya, we found parking without hassle and there wasn't a wait. We took this as a sign and went to our usual spot -- Daikokuya.As usual, I ordered the ramen combo, and it was filling. After finishing it, I was stuffed. Comparing it to the one in Monterey Park, the original one in Little Tokyo just tastes better. Maybe it is because its the original, or it feels more authentic, but the ramen just tasted better. One thing I did notice was the egg. The Monterey Park location has the egg over easy on the inside, but the egg temperature on was cold. The egg from the Little Tokyo location was warm. This may sound like nitpicking, but it makes a huge difference. Eating cold egg yolk is not a good feeling.One new thing I tried here was the gyoza. The gyoza were nice and fried on one side, steamed on the other. The skin was nice and thin, yet tender, and the filling was filled with meaty, oniony goodness. Dipping it in the soy sauce, the bite I had was delicious. The contrast from the fried side and steamed side is what pleasured me. You have a crunch of something crispy, and the mouth feel of something chewy. This combines into a perfect bite with the succulent meaty filling. This was my first time trying the gyozas, and am now a fan.Daikokuya in Little Tokyo is our go to spot. Sit at the bar with no wait, and you are transported to Tokyo. Chefs rigorously cook the noodles, fry the rice, and cook everything else in between -- all in front of you. This fairy tiny ramen shop is popular amongst the Los Angeles community. Lines start forming at dinner time, so it is best to go early or man up and sit at the bar. Either way, get ready for some good/authentic ramen. For more reviews on Daikokuya including other items, check the post on the Monterey Park Location.",4
"My review has been way long over due!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was totally in love the first time I ate. It's still my #1 go to Ramen restaurant!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_No one can beat Daikokuya!!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This location is better than the one in Monterey Park and Arcadia and it's the original. There's usually a long wait on weekends depending what time you go and how big your party is but it's so worth the wait.. I've been seated within 20 minutes before on a Friday night and sometimes I have to wait 45mins.. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They accept CASH Only!Let me start off by saying the portion is HUGE!! And the food gets served fast! I usually get their tonkatsu soup base but their spicy miso is more rich in flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you're craving for something more salty I would recommend the spicy miso. You can also add on sides (California rolls, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_spicy tuna, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_salmon) and make it a combo. It's more than enough food! I love their chashu; fatty, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_tender and a good size! They also offer red ginger and garlic on the side. The broth also comes with bean sprouts which my husband loves and they give just the right amount of onions! Their noodles are also cooked well and is chewy!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Can't wait to come back :)",5
"One of the best ramen places I've been to! Get here early before opening or else you'll have a wait. And if you do have to wait, it's totally worth it!Get the Kotteri flavor if you want a richer broth. The ramen itself was great. The noddles were chewy, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and all the ingredients were fresh. The slices of pork were very tender. They also do a half order if you want a smaller bowl. Also did the takoyaki as an app. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Great flavor and not overly doughy. They have ginger and garlic, plus your standard chili flakes.This place totally will fulfill your ramen needs!Do note that it's cash only.",5
"On a chilly night out, ramen always hits the spot. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen noodles and broth were tasty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I added nori to my soup as I like the flavor.",4
"The food is amazing! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, be forewarned that the wait time to be seated can be insane. So pack a lunch for you to have while waiting to be seated. If you go on an empty stomach be prepared to go through several stages of hunger as you sit there smelling the delicious food and gawk at the plates other patrons are eating. I think I even became delirious at one point. Once the food was brought out, it was an epiphany! All kidding aside. This place is great and definitely worth the wait!",5
"I believe Daikokuya is Japanese for, ""yes I'm willing to wait 90+ minutes to be seated."" I may be mistaken though.If you can withstand the long wait times, then you are ready to consume one of the best-tasting ramen soups Los Angeles has to offer. The great Confucius teaches of patience, so if you want to be like Confucius, then listen to him!The ambiance alone is worth visiting. It feels like an episode of Naruto. They also have old manga's you can read while waiting if you happen to be one of the lucky ones to find a seat in the waiting area.I order the spicy ramen which is hardly spicy but I enjoy it nonetheless. I appreciate the fact that an egg is already included in the soup. Other places charge extra for an egg (Orochon!).All in all, come for the food and stay for the food.",5
"Hi there.. Tonight was supposed to be a good evening with someone.. It turned out to be a disappointment... All because she wanted to try this place.... This joint sucks! Place is stupidly tiny, and the food is definitely not worth the 45 mns drive one way to get to it. They just leave you outside as you wait 1 hr to be seated and once you are seated and place your order, the food is not that great... What a disappointment tonight... Won't ever come here again!!I wish I could give a zero star!Save yourselves the hassle!",1
"Best ramen outside of Japan. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is a reason that there are over 5000 positive reviews. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food is amazing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_make sure you have a salad as well as the ramen because their salad dressing is sooo good.I had the Combo with Kottori (it's extra pork fat and it makes the broth super creamy) and shredded pork with a starter of gyoza. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The combo comes with salad, the dressing on the salad is amazing and can be purchased thank goodness!You will more than likely have left overs, the serving sizes are huge. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food is so great that I always stuff myself silly hand walk out with a food baby onboard. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is always a wait from when they open to when they close, plan on there being a wait, expect there to be a wait, ask the waitress how long she estimates your wait time will be, they are very acurate at this. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Thre is a small amount of wait seating inside but plan on standing outside the shop for the better part of an hour before you get served",5
"Daikokuya has it all - huge portions, cheap prices, and amazing food! I had the combination shredded pork bowl with Daikoku ramen and my boyfriend had the combination tuna sashimi bowl. Because it was a combination, I was expecting half a bowl of ramen but no, it was the bona fide full bowl.The ramen: noodles were nicely al dente, chashu were super tender and melted in my mouth, broth was flavorful and not too fatty or salty, and the egg was perfectly boiled. This was definitely one of the best bowls of ramen I've ever had. Everyone compares Daikokuya to Totto in NY, and I must say my loyalty has now shifted to LA.I was so full from the ramen that I couldn't even finish my shredded pork bowl. I did manage to get a few bites down and the pork was so tender and had a nice sweet glaze. Boyfriend's tuna sashimi bowl came with 5 large slabs of fresh tuna. Daikokuya sure knows how to deliver the best quality AND quantity of delicious Japanese food. This was well worth the 45 minute wait.",5
"This place was recommended by a few friends, so on Saturday afternoon I venture out to little Tokyo. While I was driving there I realized that this place probably didn't have a parking lot, indeed I was right. So while I was looking for parking I drove into the Office Depot parking lot. Once inside the friendly valet man told me to stop by Starbucks and get validation. I only paid 6 dollars ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_so while I'm walking down to the restaurant I encountered food trucks yay! Walking mesmerized I reached the place...kinda hard to miss when there is a massive line. I went inside and I was kinda put off bc of the size of the place. It's basically a hole in the wall. I realized at that moment that my party of 6 was gonna be hard to accommodate, but at this point I'm excited and I don't mind seating in different tables. Once inside, you and..I mean YOU need to write down ur name bc no one greets you, which is ok.the issues I had was that they're very unorganized with their list, and the hostesses speak very little English. Which makes it hard to communicate so when ur there and you've written ur name down, remember the number that is next to ur name bc that's what they'll call out. Once we are all seated we are handed the menus,waitress was a bit pushy about appetizers, so we agreed to ordered some which were the California rolls and the spicy tuna rolls... they were ok. Then we ordered daikokuyo ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ramen. The bowl is 11 not bad at all. One of our friends a vegetarian so she asked about substitutions, they flat out told her they had none. The waitress did inform her that they had fried tofu as a side dish and it be 4 bucks, she also mentioned that she can opted on the meat..at this my friend is upset. So she decides she won't eat. Shortly after we get the ramen, it was ok not as flavorful... the broth wasn't thick and they do give a good amount of noodles other that the place is really just blah... I think people just hype this place it's not worth the drive or the time... oh and it's a mandatory tip even if you feel as though they don't deserve it.",1
"Second chances make the world go 'round. After a depressing surprise (Yojie was unexpectedly closed down because of a random flood :( ) my girlfriend and I decided to head out to Little Tokyo to enjoy happy hour at one of my fave bars: Far Bar. While we were there, we contemplated on dinner. Both of us had Daikokuya before and we weren't impressed in the past, but because we were right next door and had time to kill we said fuck it and put our name down ready to give it a second chance! Had one too many drinks at Far Bar... came back like 45 minutes later and like 6 parties were crossed out after us. We thought we would have to wait again to eat (we didn't care because we were fine with drinking more at Far Bar) but the host sat us down right away with no hesitation. Moral of the story: go drink at Far Bar! Felt like zero wait at all. Already an awesome beginning to our meal.I don't know if the alcohol impaired my judgment because clearly (if you read my last review), I was NOT a fan of this place... not even the slightest bit. But oh my, the spicy miso was SO. DAMN. delicious!!! I don't think they served spicy miso before or else I would have for sure gotten it? I remember that the regular ramen was super bland and boring. HIGHLY recommend ONLY ordering the spicy miso. Automatic +2 stars! We also shared the gyoza, cold noodles, and side of chashu pork bowl. Pork bowl is bomb! Make your ramen a combo and get it for sure. Cold noodles are very refreshing and light. GYOZA is PERFECT. Uniquely prepared, I highly recommend it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ordered WAY TOO MUCH FOOD for 2 girls lol but I would say it was the perfect combination. We had plenty to take home.Still not the best ramen in the world, but way better than what I remember. So here is the obligatory update with the obligatory star increase. :)",4
"Came to try their ramen; after a 40 min wait on a Monday night, seated at narrow counter. Tiny restaurant with 5-6 booths and counter seating for about 10. You get the usual portion in a large bowl. Broth is not too salty, whole egg cooked perfectly, tender pork, bean sprouts; purÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©ed garlic on table. Average tasting broth, noodles done well. Other items on menu incl chicken/beef bowls, rice dishes, better than average gyoza, bentos. Personally I don't think the restaurant food is worth the wait; would rather spend the time enjoying one of the many restaurants nearby.",3
"This is my favorite ramen shop in LA. Hands down. The broth is thick and flavorful. The noodles are substantial, with just enough give, and never over done. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't even mind the horrendous wait that's become synonymous with Daikokuya because it's just that good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Also, you can put your name down and walk around the Little Tokyo Plaza, so the wait really isn't that bad.Always get the kotteri style broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The fact that its description has the words ""back fat"" in it is definitely scary, but you knew you didn't sign up for a juice cleanse when you decided to get ramen, so don't skimp and do it right. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I like the spicy miso ramen because I love spicy food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The original ramen is good too, but I'll choose kick you in the mouth flavor over subtlety any day. Get a combo, and your meal will start with a shredded cabbage salad, doused in ginger mayo dressing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They're smart about it and layer the dressing so that the whole salad is covered in the wonderful sauce til the last bite.As for the combo, I always get either the chashyu pork bowl or the eel bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't think there's enough salmon sashmi for that combo to be worth the price, and I didn't like the chicken terriyaki when I got it. Kind of dry, but might have been a fluke. The establishment is decorated with kitschy pieces of japanese art, old style dolls, and various other tchotchkes. Make sure that your whole party is there when you want to get seated bc otherwise you can lose your precious spot in line.It's cash only, but there's a convenience store right next to it that does cash back with a minimum purchase.",5
"Ridiculous wait...2+ hours just for a bowl of ramen? Totally not worth it. The ramen is good but not THE best to be worth the disgusting wait. Additionally be very careful with their wait list system. We got skipped two seats because the waiter failed to see our name hurried within the crossed off list to seat five people. Overall, beside the food, a terrible experience and a total waste of a day.",2
"My family went on a saturday here. They open at 11am, got here around 10am.. so we killed time at the japanese village across the street. Bad move!When we got back, the place already sat in people that was on the waitlist.. and there were more people waiting outside.. hmmmn waiting game! After 45mins or ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_so... we got seated at a booth.Service was absolutely fast! Simple menu. Of course we got their ramen.. the broth was pretty tasty and the noodles... ohmahgahhh i liked their noodles idk why maybe because it was just perfectly cooked.. not too saggy and not over cooked. Prices are decent.. considering the quality and quantity of food you get.I heard good things about their fried rice.. will try that on my next visit!",4
"My friend and I came on a Sunday night around 9pm and put our name on the list. We waited about an hour before we were seating (killed time by walking around the area and looking at different shops). The service was quick and and standard. Nothing too special but since they were busy, it was understandable. All that really mattered to me was my water was never quite empty.I ordered the combo with spicy miso ramen and a salmon rice bowl. The rice bowl was just okay. The ramen was good, flavorful but not very spicy. They give some spices on the table so you can adjust as needed. My friend got the cold tsukemen ramen which was better than mine (I preferred the broth flavor to the miso flavor) and the chasu was the star for me though, so delicious and fatty!Next time I'm in LA, I'll have to make a stop here again.",4
"I've been to this ramen restaurant quite a few times and each time I seriously feel fat after. Utterly FAT! It must be the pork broth or high sodium of the broth. Or it may be just me because everyone I know raves about how great their ramen is. They will even wait 2 hrs just for a nice warm noodle soup on a hot or cold day. Trust me, I have as well. I've had their Daikoku Ramen with pork cutlet or fried rice. It's a combo! The establishment is pretty small but it gives you the feel of how restaurants in Tokyo looks like. Parking is near by for $4-5 or on the street. Just remember to have great company while waiting in line. :)",3
Not impressed... I had high hopes for this place since every time I passed by it was always packed. It tasted average. Not worth the wait.,3
"I remember enjoying daikokuya 1-2 years ago when I first had it. The reason I didn't come here that often was because I was lazy to deal with LA traffic.This place didn't excite my taste buds as much as the other ramen places I've been to. They were good.... it's not my favorite, proly cuz I like my broth less fatty? Or maybe I'm ""meh"" about it because everyone LOVES this place? One thing I wasn't too fond of was the dough-y taste of the noodle, maybe it'll be different if I try it again. I did enjoy the broth and chasu.Overall the service was great and I recommend getting the gyoza and fried rice to share.Parking costs money unless you get lucky with street parking.",4
"Imagine a hot bowl of rich, fatty Daikoku ramen filled with chewy chijire style egg noodles, kurobota pork belly, (soft) boiled egg, bamboo shoots and green onions. I LOVE a lot of green onions in my ramen and also, LOVE, LOVE the fact that there's a little garlic pot at every table. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I piled it on!The pan fried gyoza could've been more crispy though. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Awesome, attentive service made up for the hour wait we had to endure. I'd love to say more wonderful things about Daikokuya but I'll just refer you to fancypants x. review ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_=)",5
"My first time I've ever had ramen! Being a vegetarian, it's hard to find good Asian food, but this place even had vegan ramen options. It's a tiny lil restaurant that you could even miss if you didn't know about how amazing it is. It usually has a line outside so just know that it might take like 10 minutes to get seated. Also, remember that this place only takes cash, but they do have an ATM machine at the back.",4
"I went there when I stopped by Little Tokyo while I was giving my friend a tour. She wanted to eat ramen so it took me a while to decide where since there were so many ramen restaurant(I mean, we were in Little Tokyo! Come on! LOL). We finally decided to eat here, and ramen was great! One of the best ramen I have Eder tasted in the US! Great place!",5
"Me and my friend got here shortly after they opened and managed to snag the last two seats at the bar. By the time we left the restaurant was packed and there was a line out the door, for good reason. We each got ramen. I've only had ramen back home in Oklahoma and never really liked it. But this ramen? The broth was so complex in flavor that I could've eaten it alone. Everything was delicious and the service was friendly but not annoying. I'll miss this place when I go home.",5
"The ramen mecca of southern California.This place was completely packed on a random Tuesday afternoon plus there was a line out he door. Being the jaded NY'er I am, I was a bit skeptical about all the hype, but after having lunch here I am completely on board; Daikokuya is great.The food is really, really good. Huge size portions with some noodles, some pork, some eggs, some veggies and some amazingly flavorful broth. Simple and well executed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Worth going out of your way for.",4
"BEST RAMEN IVE EVER HADWent with my girlfriend and I a Friday night (shouldn't have) waited outside, it was pretty cold, for over an hr. Maybe hour and a half but it was most definitely worth it. My girlfriend and I loved the spicy pork ramen. Will be back soon but will try to go at a time where they don't have much clientele. Amazing ramen. It's a must try.",5
"If you have a Japanese friend, or you can read reviews in Japanese, most of them will give you some negative comments on this place. Daikokuya is not the best ramen restaurant anymore and I literally don't know any Japanese person who likes ramen and likes this place.They used to be very good about 10 years ago when they had a young Japanese chef (with huge tattoos on his arms). After he quit, they totally went downhill. Soup is lukewarm and salty but the worst part is that whenever I dine there, I had a diarrhea!!! (Many of my friends said they also do too!!!) I can't believe people still wait in a freakin long line for a worthless garbage. This is 2016 and there are so many good ramen restaurants in LA/OC area. Wake up people!!!",1
"Not as good as I expected. The soup has a bitter after taste. They just dip the egg into deluded soy sauce. Nothing special about the chashu either. Overall, I believe there are better choices than this place.",3
"Honestly, the ramen is not as good as Yamada-ya or Minca/Kambi in NYC, but I guess I wouldn't be kvetching if it was in my Midwestern city. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A shout-out for the deep-fried tuna/shiso appetizer, which is unique to Daikokuya and definitely worth ordering.Go early, or be prepared to stand in line.",4
"Best Japanese Pork Ramen I had outside of Asia.It's worth the $10+ USD.The broth was light yet still creamy &amp; flavorful. The authentic noodles and egg cooked just right. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The slices of pork so tender that they melt in your mouth just like kobe beef, Yum!",5
People working at the restaurant were still smiling even at 1 am! Ordered the combination of spicy ramen and teriyaki bowl. Will definitely try it again even though we have to wait again.,5
"In my opinion, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_this little location is the best location compared to the others. The Ramen just tastes better here. If you are a Ramen lover, and know your Ramen this is the place to try. Tonkatsu Ramen koterri styleSpicy miso RamenYakisobaFried riceThese are my recommendations. The wait could be long and they won't Seat you if your party is not all here.Street meter parking only. Cash only!",4
"Every time I've been to this location, it has been really busy with a waiting list. Daikokuya is totally worth it that I'd wait over an hour just to have it, which we did yesterday for New Years Day. I love the texture of the ramen, and the broth is amazing! (Not too thick and not too bland either.) I definitely recommend this location mostly because the broth is consistently good. I only docked one star because they still only accept cash, which really is not a big deal since they provide an ATM in the back, but still.. Service is efficient, and timely. I believe the Daikoku Ramen was $11.",4
"Came here both times I visited LA, and I love it! I always get the ramen with koteri flavour and the ikura side order. Chewy noodles and thick rich broth, so good! The line up is long, but you can always put your name down first and then pass some time walking around Little Tokyo.",5
"My girlfriend and I came here by way of a friends recommendation. Showed up on a Sunday nite and almost booked it. ""No no..wait"" Said the voice in my head., and so we did. It was definitely worth it. The wait went by quickly and the food was served quickly with very friendly service. Will come again!",5
"I'm a fan of the ramen here. Its really good and the price isn't that bad.I get the Ramen and pork rice bowl.Broth has alot of flavor, noodles complement it really well.what i hate is its too far!Parking sucks, wait is forever, small restaurant.",5
"I really can appreciate a place that has a relatively sparse menu as long as they know what they are doing. I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen combination with the shredded pork rice since I wanted to try two things. The ramen was so big I could only taste the shredded pork over rice, there was no way I was gonna finish all of that, and I hadn't eaten all day too!I had decided to get the broth in the ramen ""kotteri"" style which just basically means it's richer in pork flavor and is fattier. I tried the regular broth too and the kotteri is the way to go, not everyone will like it though, its pretty rich, but I drank the entire bowl afterwards=)While others in my party felt like the entire experience was too salty I disagreed, I felt it was flavorful and fragrant. I do tend to skew on the savory side though. The shredded pork bowl was good as well, slightly sweet crispy pork over rice. I only had a taste and decide to finish the ramen first since I figured the rice would keep better as left overs. Be warned, this place draws a crowd. We went on a Sunday. At 4pm. On Superbowl Sunday. And we still had to wait near 30 minutes for a table! Is it worth it? I can't say. I really hate waiting for food so if i were to come back I'd plan ahead and make sure I put my name on the list an hour before I might get hungry. Oh and Cash Only. But they have copius signs everywhere to remind you of that!",4
"I'm no ramen expert but the noodles are worth the wait (to an extent.... like maybe an hour... past that go somewhere else lol) but really the wait isn't that bad bc you can just walk around Little Tokyo which is super pretty &amp; entertaining. We finally got into the tiny little restaurant and my friend and I both ordered the standard ramen bowl and man was it delish. The noodles were perfectly slippery and soft, broth was great, meat was good though they didn't give us that much. Feels very authentic and tastes even better after the wait!",4
"I came here with a group of 6 right when it opened at 11am. Even so, there was a long line already there and we were not seated until 40 minutes later.Everyone ordered ramen, as I had the spicy miso ramen ($9.95). I will always choose the spicy option. The ramen came out very quickly in a huge bowl. It came with chashu, bean sprouts, onions, bamboo shoots and an egg. I have to say that their egg is cooked perfectly to a point when the yolk is very soft. Although I like bean sprouts, they gave more than necessary. The service was well, but we were too hungry to care. We all ended up paying $12 each. The biggest let down is that the place is CASH ONLY, which makes my life more difficult.",3
"Wow! What a meal.. The Shredded pork ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_bowl, If it ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_was my last meal, in front of a firing squad. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'd pull my blind fold. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Enjoy my meal, wipe my mouth with the blindfold and yell, ""FIRE"".",5
"Bring cash, get lucky and find a parking spot right in front of the restaurant, pray that there is a short wait, order the ramen (and a shredded pork bowl while you're at it), and nothing else in the world will matter for the 10 minutes it takes to finish the meal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Even if none of the above happens, this place merits 5 stars for the ramen alone regardless of the circumstances in which it is eaten - hour-long wait, hard-to-find parking or resorting to parking garage on side street, forgetting cash and incurring fees using ATM machine inside restaurant, eating in sauna-like conditions while the AC is struggling to cool down the space - this has all happened to me in the many times that I've eaten here, but I always come back. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The rich pork broth, the perfectly chewy noodles with the perfect amount of bite, the right amount and type of toppings, and that old-school Little Tokyo feel leave nothing to be desired. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've eaten at the Costa Mesa location a couple of times also, but somehow the food tastes a little better at this one. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's the standard by which to measure all other ramen shops. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Perfection.",5
"Ordered a Daikokuya ramen and a cold soup ramen, and both were really good. Soup was tasty so we drank them all up! Because we went on 2pm on Sun so we waited about half an hour. Service was efficient. Because it was impossible to street park in Little Tokyo, it would be better to park in a parking garage nearby and walked there, which didn't cost much.",5
Koteri broth was dank af. Almost too dank that I'd probably get the regular next time. But it was delicious nonetheless. Beat the rush and come early!,5
"Seriously amazing! By far my favorite ramen place in the world! You can't go wrong here. Everything is absolutely to die for. I can't wait to come back and try the other flavors. There's always a huge line here. We came here for an early dinner and there still was a line. But we waited less than an hour so it wasn't too bad. I guess it would have been worse if we came here during prime dinner hours. But, it's still worth it! There's only street parking which parking kinda sucks here so good luck!",5
"Came here for a ramen craving in a Saturday night, and it has been the longest line of crowd we've seen so far...stretch out to five restaurants nearbyParking: it's only street parking and there are parking structures near by about a block or two away, between $5-$10 depends on the structure. The place is small so the line is always long, so we usually have one person gets out of the car, go sign in while the other person parks the car. The specialty ramen here is the Daikoku Ramen, and you can also get it in combo, where it comes with a small salad and a bowl combo. The wait: it was a Saturday night so it is expected to wait for a long time, and boy, did we wait. We signed in at 7:50 and waited until 9:20 when our number was called. Was it worth it? Sure. I ordered the pork cutlet combo and the salad dressing that amazing. I didn't like the soup much since it was salty than I remember. And I like to make my own creation with it, I eat the ramen itself with the salad dressing and I love it! For those who not afraid to try this, you might like it. The service: our server did take a while to come to take our order but they did come check on us when they see an empty cup on our table so that was awesome!",5
"Came here on a Tuesday at 3:30pm barely any wait got seated in 15 minutes. The wait is usually crazy so that was very lucky of us.We ordered 3 orders of the Daikoku Ramen, two of them with kotteri(the enriched flavor), as well as a tempura bowl(part of a combo with one of the ramens).First of all, the salad that comes with the combo is amazing, nice blend of Japanese sesame dressing and a mayo taste, 10/10. Tempura was also well fried, lightly coated.Now comes the ramen. Tbh I wasn't surprised since it wasn't like a BABAMMMM but it certainly was tasty. Broth was really heavy since I ordered the kotteri, again, tastes good but not delicious. I guess I was too hyped for this place but I prefer kopan in dt Fullerton over this place.",3
The quality of the Tonkotsu broth changed in the past two years. Last time I came here I got the ramen + katsudon combo. Katsudon was still great but the ramen was very disappointing.,3
"What is all the fuss about......this place is greatly overrated. I came because a backwards blind and tasteless co-worker said I had to go... I trusted him because honestly he looks like he is a professional food lover, pshh apparently people will eat anything these days. Tatsu ramen or tsujita la in lil Osaka off of Olympic and sawtelle are just 2 of the great alternatives I can suggest. Do yourself a favor eat dog poop before u come here it will fill you up and most likely taste 10 times better..... Noodles ehh, broth weak, pork....what pork?... Sooo lame and the wait is beyond not worth it seriously such an insult to my time and mouth.....p.s. People seriously need to wake up and smell the crappy",1
"This is the best ramen I've had besides tsujita who, sorry, takes the crown.But daaaamn the broth AND noodles are good here. I also love that they have affordable beer and it's easy and affordable to add things to tailor your ramen.There's also garlic and chili paste on the table.",5
"I am a bit sad to give them 3 stars. Maybe 3.5 stars? And it isn't even because of the wait! Arrived around 8:30pm and was seated around 9:15pm for 4 people. Keep a mental note that a lot of people are ""skipped"" because they are ""no-shows"" which does help move the waiting time drastically! Seating - typical small-medium restaurant. I would NOT come here in a group, if so, no larger than a group of 4. Service is quick. Review the menu while you wait so that you can order right away. I ordered the Daikokuya ramen with a side of pork and rice $12.95. It also comes with salad and the dressing is so delicious! It's rich and creamy, so it probably isn't the best to eat all the time. But they do sell it by the bottle if you want to take one home. I should not have ordered the ramen with a side because I was so stuffed when I finished my ramen. The broth didn't live up to expectations. It wasn't rich enough for me. It was a bit bland honestly. And my food wasn't served piping hot. I like it burn-your-mouth hot. The pork is meaty with minimal fat. I hate it when restaurants serve me 2 piece of pork in my ramen with literally 2 nibbles of meat. Anyways, I love that they give you an entire egg instead of half an egg! The side of rice and pork was good. My friend who got the fried rice says it was delicious!",3
"This place is the closest in taste I've had since I left Japan. The ramen is worth the long wait, and the gyoza is ridiculous!! A must try! It's a party in your mouth that just won't stop.",5
"Don't be deceived by long wait....people leave and it ends up being shorter than what you expect! We were told 45 mins for 2 people and waited only 20. We ordered the traditional ramen, spicy tuna roll, gyoza, and 2 beers each. It totaled under $35, such a great deal! And hefty portions - we couldn't finish all our food. Loved the ramen broth and noodles. The pork was so tender as well. Gyoza perfectly soft and crunchy at the same time. Spicy tuna roll was legit as well. The waiter was such a sweet and funny hippy Asian guy - added so much to our meal! Can't wait to go back soon",5
"Get there early: we arrived at 11 right when it opened and we still had to wait about 30 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was even longer around noon and 1pm. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_That was for LUNCH on a THURSDAY. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_What we ate/shared:Spicy Miso RamenPROS-great portion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can't go wrong with Daikokuya if you're hungry.-not super spicy like korean jam bbong (spicy seafood noodle soup)-decent flavorCONS-pales in comparison to the kottegi style tonkatsu ramen-as I mentioned above, decent flavor, not outstanding flavor.-could use more pork (chashu) slices or ""sustenance"" other than noodles and soup.TONKATSU ""kottegi style"" RAMEN : by far my favorite at Daikokuya.PROS-great portion (as always)-amazing drop dead flavor, super rich and creamy-shareable (only if you are a light eater)CONS-if you're not used to heavy rich foods, this doesn't sit so well in the stomach.KATSUDON: I originally thought this was supposed to be a ""butadon"" or pork-bowl like the one I had originally off the Sawtelle location, but I guess this is different here in the main branch.PROS-very nicely sized portion for a combo-good flavor, well marinated meat-rice was perfect, not too dry, not too stickyCONS-not shareable if you're splitting just this small bowl.-no veggies unless you consider a sprinkling of green/spring onion ""vegetables""TEMPURA DONPROS-good portion for small eater: same size as katsudon above-sauce came on the side: perfect for different types of eaterstempura was very crispyCONS-somewhat plain tasting? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't think that there should be salt in the batter but for some reason, it was really simple compared to the other dishes.In summary:spicy miso ramen: ***.5 (3.5 stars)tonkatsu ""kottegi-style"" ramen: ****.25 (4.25 stars)buta don (pork bowl): ***.75 (3.75) starsten don (tempura bowl): *** (3 stars)",4
"The wait was over an hour, and I appear to have wasted at least 5 minutes waiting in a line of other confused patrons that were unaware there is a sign-in reservation list.But wow, the food was fantastic.I discovered I'm not actually a fan of ramen, but their crispy chicken bowl was amazing. The beef bowl was pretty dry, but still quite tasty. The miso soup was chock full of goodies, and the spicy tuna roll was good.Keep in mind: it's cash only, and you have to put your name on the clipboard inside the door (there is no proper standing ""line,"" and many people wander away because of the long wait).",4
"The line was crazy long!! The ramen broth was ok, nothing to go crazy about. We got a oolong and green tea and it tasted like nothing but water and it smelled funny. The prices are average.",3
"The reviews do not lie. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen here is incredible. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is full of flavor, and the noodles were firm and not soggy.The line was out the door to so that's a good indicator that this place is great. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_One thing that's odd though is that this restaurant is cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Oh and the shredded pork is amazing.",5
"Came here on a Monday night w my boyfriend and two other friends, my boyfriend recommended this place because he has been here several times and told us that it is one of the best ramen places he's been to. I checked the yelp reviews and saw that it had a lot of good reviews and wanted to try it out too. Who knew this place would be so packed? We paid $10 parking and waited literally almost 2 hours to decide to not even eat here. The service was horrible. Every time I tried to ask the hostess (star tattoo on her wrist &amp; a mole on her face) how much longer it would take, she would ignore me and walk away (RUDE MUCH?). Also she was very unorganized, she would skip over people and call people that had a larger group to seat, what's worse is she had a low pitched voice where no one can hear her but herself, since she would talk so low and since nobody would come up to get seated, she would cross their name out even when they're still there. How did she even get hired? No offense, i understand it may get frustrating since it's always so packed, but you get paid to do this job, work in the kitchen if you don't want to be dealing with customers. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Also, it's a very small restaurant.. I'm sure they're able to expand their restaurant and with 6,000+ reviews? must make a lot of money, unless they pay for their reviews. Sucks I didn't get to try the food, but I can't deal w shitty service.Hopefully they can fix their management.",1
"One of my favorite ramen spots in LA. I've been here three times and they have never left me in disappointment. Although the place is small, the service is fast. When I came here 30 minutes before closing, it was still packed! That's how good it is. Whenever I come here I always order the Daikokuya Ramen and Gyoza. I love spicy food and since the Daikokuya ramen is not spicy I always ask for chili oil which gives it the right amount of spice! The Gyoza is amazing as well. Unlike other Gyoza, this one has a nice crisp side that gives it a delicious taste. I recommend ordering these two when coming here! Also if you don't have a big appetite I would recommend ordering the half size because the original size is huge! They give you so much noodles and broth but it's all so good :)",5
I had high expectations for this place given the myriad reviews with high ratings and the long line (we waited an hour even though we lined up outside before it opened). I got the Daikokuya ramen with extra fatty broth since that seemed be recommended by the menu. The broth was decent though nothing special. I would've given 4 stars but the soft boiled egg they gave was overcooked.I would come back here if the line weren't so ridiculous.,3
I had heard of Daikokuya for years because of the high number of Yelp reviews but always assumed the line was too long. We finally made it happen last Saturday. At 3:45 on Saturday the line wasn't too bad as we waited for about 20 minutes. At 5 when we left the line was much shorter than I thought it would be. One of the employees told me it used to be well over an hour so maybe it's not quite as bad now. This is only out one day experience so I can't confirm. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen broth really was worth any wait. We ordered the specialty Daikokuya and Tsukemen which was fun to try both the constructed and unconstructed version. I like how the pork was crispy on the Tsukemen version. The broth seemed to be on the salty side with the Tsukemen. It was really good but I had already slurped out the Daikokuya bowl. We also had the gyoza which was nicely pan fried and had a layer of crust along the top almost hiding the dumplings. If you are a ramen and Yelp fan Daikokuya is a must stop for one of the most reviewed places I have seen!,5
"I've had better ramen around San Gabriel Valley. I love that this place feels divey and is definitely a hot spot downtown for ramen so that I appreciate. The portions are large and the ramen was tasty but not my favorite. There was something lacking to make it really ""wow"". The service was scant and just ok actually a little below average expectations. No one introduces themselves at the table. The guy approached us immediately after sitting down and said ""want are you ordering?"" I said we needed some time to look at the menu and he walked away without saying anything. Seemed a bit rude to me. Also took forever to get someone to pick up the bill so we sat around waiting to pay for quite some time.",3
"Being enticed to come here for $5 ramen during their 11th Anniversary yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_ is barely an inducement -- the wait to get in is horrendous and free parking is not to be had, not to mention the time and gas just to get here anyway...Fortunately, their kotteri broth is still like liquid gold -- a rich, sweet, not too salty porky goodness that is so good that I bagged it even when I finished everything else. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It makes a terrific snack for later, just reheat it and add a package of ramen noodle cooked separately and relive the goodness. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wavy noodles at Daikokuya were perfectly al dente, the thinly diced green onions were plentiful, the menma was delightful, the fresh bean sprouts were slightly crunchy, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and the chasiu was tender and savory. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But a shadow was cast over the bowl when I bit into the ajisuke tamago; ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_it was past soft and edging towards hard, the yoke had set, and worst of all -- it was COLD as in taken out of the refrigerator COLD; ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_this was something of a surprise because I used to boast of how perfect their eggs were...The broth is still badass, but between the hardness of the egg, the expected wait to get in, and the parking situation, I have to take away a star and admit that although it's worth the hassle, it's still a hassle...",5
$10 for a bowl of ramen isn't too shabby. Happy that their egg is soft-boiled--I judge places with hard-boiled eggs. 3 stars because the broth was average and they skimp you on the meat.,3
"The ramen is good. There's really only one thing you need to eat here... which is The Specialty Ramen. I mean, you can get other dishes too but you should be coming here for ramen. I came here around 11:30am on a Monday. No wait.Though I think I may prefer the Shin Sen Gumi ramen a little more in Fountain Valley. But that's a long ways away. hahahaha. So come here and eat the freaking ramen.",4
"I've enjoyed this transplant from Japan for its feel of authentic Japanese bar food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Sitting at the counter, your clothes start becoming saturated with the aroma of deep fried tonkatsu, ramen broth and other delicacies.

"Piping hot ramen on a cold day, or so I thought (explanation forthcoming).Decided to hoof it down to Lil Tokyo before catching a matinee performance of ""Backbeat"" at the Ahmanson Theatre. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've heard the masses, some partial to Shin Sen Gumi, some partial to Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So here it is - Enter the culinary deathmatch!I arrived around 11am on Saturday, with Daikokuya already being busy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Seating is minimal, with the bar and a row of booths, with one booth beside the door. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The decor made the place seem like I was transported to Tokyo, with hipsters &amp; businessmen sititng side by side, slurping every last bit of broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait wasn't too long &amp; I was promptly seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Of course, I had to order the Daikokuya Special Ramen Kotteri-style for $8.95-yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_Large bowl - check!Egg - check!Pork meat - check!Green onions - check!Piping hot - huh?My bowl of ramen was warm, not hot. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'm not sure if the noodles absorbed the heat of the broth, but the piping hot goodness was instead a lukewarm, mild goodness. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Naturally, I have to add pickled ginger &amp; garlic. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I just about used all the ginger in the jar &amp; most of the garlic. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Visual evidence (these jars were full before I had my way with them)-yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_My ramen was rich, fatty, spicy &amp; quite pleasant to the tastebuds. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Lots of food to put down, even for a pro like me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Sitting at the bar, I had the chance to chat with a couple seated on my right. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Seeing me take pics, I was asked if I was a blogger, to which I replied ""Sorta, I'm on Yelp"" :)Now for the comparison - Having now had both Daikokuya &amp; Shin Sen Gumi, I have to give the nod to Shin Sen Gumi. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Reasons are-Customization - Shin Sen Gumi allows for diners to choose their toppings whereas Daikokuya is fixed.Seating - More seating is available at Shin Sen Gumi, which makes it more convenient for large parties.Taste - While Daikokuya was good, I think Shin Sen Gumi was that much more better. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The temperature of the ramen probably played a factor, too.Daikokuya, your food was good, but if I was in the area again, I'd most likely head across the way to Shin Sen Gumi to see if the wait is shorter.NOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM",4
"Cleanliness/decor (1) - A little hole in the wall, it felt oily, cramped, and dingy. I've sat in communal Japanese restaurants that felt more spacious than this place. I literally felt elbow to elbow. Of course, this is sitting at the bar area. People that were there were hipsters and business people0Staff (1) - The staff felt authentic ::winkwink::. They were nice and welcoming. 1Food (1-2) - I was in L.A. and read the reviews to this ramen place, being that I grew up in the South Bay and live in Orange County, I was expecting authenticity. Nope. How can I put it lightly, LARDY. Literally, globules of fat, that I thought were garlic, nope, fat. I understand this is common in ramen broths, but, not stewy like lardiness. And the pork slices, stringy and stringy fat. I have never left a bowel of ramen and this one, I did. I couldn't. And the broth, gross and lacking. Garlic and pickled ginger are on the side to give you help to eat it all. If I'm ever in L.A. for authentic ramen, I'm sticking to Torrance and Gardena area, if this is what Down Town L.A. has to offer for ramen, I'll pass. 1Price (1) - There's other places around L.A. that offer better ones at a lower price, we came at a lunch specials and ended up spending $35. Not worth it. 0",2
"SALT. Very salty noodles in bland broth. I don't get why there is always a long line outside. Plus, u feel hurried by the waitstaff as soon as u finally get a table.",1
"I think my biggest mistake was coming to this place with super high expectations because of all the good reviews. The wait was bearable because I constantly reminded myself that I drove an hour just to try out this place. I ordered the daikoku ramen and fried rice. The fried rice was really bland but it did come with what I think was coleslaw (the dressing was a bit different but really good) and miso soup. The ramen's okay if you don't like too much flavor in your food. I prefer the broth to be more salty but that's just me. They do give you a lot of noodles but only a couple of pieces of chashu. You have to pay extra if you want to add more pork, eggs, and other stuff in your ramen. I really liked the authentic vibe of the place but the food wasn't too memorable. It's a place worth trying out at least once just for the experience.",3
"This place is friggin' amazing and pretty near perfect. The Ramen, oh LORD the Ramen here is just absolutely heaven. Get it with pork, always. The Veggie style just doesn't feel legit even though it's delicious but you must must must try it with meat. The chicken teriyaki here is also pretty delicious with their house made sauce and perfectly fluffy rice. I want it right now actually..I can't seem to find any flaw here besides that parking can be a little of a hassle but if you're smart, just do the lots nearby that are reasonable.",5
"My favorite ramen place in LA, and I've tried quite a few places being an LA native. If you're coming here, be prepared to wait although I haven't had to wait much or at all if I can get there close to 5pm for dinner. Cash only, but they have an ATM in the back. I always debate between getting the spicy miso or the house special tonkotsu, and I usually get the spicy miso which is the tonkotsu but spicy, and I love me some spice! The ramen bowl comes with a whole egg, a few slices of pork, a few bamboo shoots and a generous handful of green onions. The noodles and egg are always perfectly cooked, and the broth is delicious! Sometimes I get the combo which comes with a side salad of shredded cabbage and a delicious creamy miso dressing then you get the house special ramen and you get to pick a small rice bowl, I always get the shredders pork bowl, which I always end up packing for lunch the next day. The pork bowl is delicious, but beware it is very greasy and you will see all the grease when you take it out of the fridge the next day. Beware this place is very small, and is often hot and crowded, all things dislike but I'm still willing to go and wait because I love the ramen so much!If you're going for the first time, it may be hard to find but it's the place with the yellow sign and a bunch of people in front waiting. You can either park on the street or a nearby lot.",5
"Authentic Ramen!!! It's not oily and not too salty. Needless to say about the service, greeting all the way from the door to the table. Ramen comes out quickly. Unfortunately, it's a little bit far from my house. I need to drive on freeway 5 about 40-50 minutes without little traffic. And, parking costs me heaps. Hope it will open one in Orange County.",5
A bit of a wait. Most ramen places u pick in NY is better than this one. Props for having ramune!!! Old decors that may be broken. Cash only!!!!!!!,3
"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE for a japanese restaurant!The japanese waitresses that work there should fucking quit their job as they clearly don't want to work there. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The place is dirty as hell.

"Where do I start with Daikokuya.. well, it was my first introduction to ramen outside of Top Ramen for one... yeah, that's a good place to start I think haha. That was six or so years ago. It set a HUGE bar for any other ramen place to reach, and there has only been one so far to come close (and possibly surpass, I need to go back there soon and compare). I love this place, and it will always be a go-to when I visit LA.Its popularity has grown since I moved, and so I will admit the wait is a little deterring, but there has not yet been a visit to LA that has not involved a trip to Daiko, obnoxious wait time or not.Unfortunately, I have found myself a little underwhelmed my last two visits. I can't quite place what is exactly besides maybe just being there at an off-hour (the broth this last time wasn't QUITE as flavorful as it usually is). This is just a small thing though as their ramen, even not at its best is incredible.Also their combination order is still heavenly, and the melty, deliciousness of their shredded pork bowl cannot properly be described in words (one can try, but it will always fall flat). No matter how much time I spend away, their pork always amazes and meets my expectations and reminds me why I come back. Even if I felt the ramen wasn't what I remember, their pork is, which alone justifies the wait. Just thinking about it... oh man.",5
"Came here to grab a bite to eat before hitting the Ahmanson for a show. When we arrived I noticed the line of people outside the restaurant. So we put our name on the list and chit chatted outside. The wait wasn't too bad maybe 15-20 minutes? Smaller parties are seated more quickly.Since we were only a party of 2 we were seated at the counter which I didn't mind because I got to see the guys working on the deliciousness that I was about to put in my tummy!! I ordered the Chicken Teri Bowl which comes with miso soup and a salad for $7.95. yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_Scott ordered the Daikokuya Ramen for $8.95. Both dishes are large in size and I was not able to finish everything. The chicken teri bowl was very good, large slices of juicy chicken covering a large size bowl of white steamed rice. The teri sauce was not too sweet with the perfect seasoning made my tummy happy. I was able to try the Daikokuya Ramen and I must say the ramen noodles and the flavoring of the broth were de-lish! Bring cash because that's all they accept and be prepared to wait. There is some street parking but only if you are lucky.",4
"A small ramen house that seats around 40 people...I recommend to get there early or prepare to wait at least 30-45 minutes, especially on a cold night in Little Tokyo.I opted to get the Daikokuya ramen with the kotteri or fatty pork broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've been to many ramen houses around LA and in Japan, this place can hold their own and ranks among the best in my book.The broth is thick, flavorful and almost gelatinous like because of the pork bone and fatty pork back used for the broth.Although a bit heavy on the green onions, luckily they can be removed at your whim. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The harmony of pork slices, egg, bamboo shoots and bean sprouts dance perfectly together in a bowl that you could swim in...My method to the madness...start with the non-essentials like the bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and remove about 99% of the green onions. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Take a small bite from the soft boiled and egg and let it swim back into the broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_From there, it's a rhythmic dance of noodles, broth, noodles, broth, noodles, broth...until the only thing floating are the two big pieces of fatty pork.With every bite, close your eyes and just think about what a great meal you just had...for those hard core ramen eaters, drink up every drop of broth until there is nothing but remnants of green onion and bean sprouts laying at the bottom of the bowl.You're welcome...",4
"there is 1 way to do Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ALONE. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_seriously, never once waited more than 10 minutes when coming here alone. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The bar of stools turns over quickly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Be sure to tell the host clearly you are a SINGLE and stay inside near the list. they will seat you as soon as a spot opens.lastly, dont forget to get a side of the fried rice. its awesome!",4
"OH EM GEEE!!! I am sold! When I travel to LA again this will be a must stop place to visit. In fact, I think I'd book a hotel near this general area, there are so many good places to eat around Little Tokyo. Side note, my friend who I ate with told me the name means, big black family, which I thought was kinda funny. Anyways back to the review on Daikokuya. I ordered the iced green tea and the Daikoko Ramen. It was delicious! I ate it all and then took a picture since I forgot to as soon as I smelled the food approaching our table. The wait was LONG. But we came on a Friday, near rush hour, and we were a group of 4 people. But the food is so worth the wait. Besides they have manga you can read if you get bored, or you can stare at the decorations like I did.The service was good, the atmosphere is excellent, the ramen is scrumptious, and the waiters are super awesome.",5
"The ramen here is just delicious. Slightly better than the Daikokuya on Sawtelle. The wait takes longer than TSA lines at LAX, but the experience is so much better unless you're lonely and choose the pat down. The broth is amazing, the noodles are delicious, and the atmosphere is great. If you're looking for a quick meal, this is definitely not the place for you. If you have a couple hours to spare and you're in the mood for likely the best ramen in LA, definitely give this a shot.",5
It's just really good.,5
"This hole in the wall restaurant serves delicious ramen. The bowl of Daikoku ramen ($8.95) or the combination order of small shredded pork bowl &amp; salad with Daikoku ramen ($12.95) are the best options.The portion size of the ramen is very generous; two servings worth. The tonkotsu soup base was creamy &amp; not overly seasoned. There are containers of pureed garlic &amp; pickled ginger on the table but the garlic was what helped complete the flavors I was searching for. The chijire style egg noodles were perfectly cooked. I wasn't a fan of the kurobuta pork belly but then again I've never been a fan of pork belly; this looked like uncooked or boiled bacon. The marinated broiled egg was firm &amp; almost flavorless until you reach the yolk. There was a decent amount of chopped green chives, bamboo shoots, &amp; bean sprouts to finish the flavors &amp; texture of the soup.The cabbage / onion salad was surprisingly delicious only because of the salad dressing. I don't know if it's homemade but the sweet, milky, light flavor was so addicting.My bf loved the shredded pork bowl. The bowl was a little larger than how a side of miso soup is served. It was filled with a bed of white rice topped with grilled pork belly, pickled ginger, green onions, &amp; a sweet glaze.We arrived just before 5pm &amp; only waited 10 min for two seats at the bar but evidently the wait can get quite long. Add your name to the wait list &amp; take a seat if one is open (nine waiting chairs) or wait outside because it's a tight area to stand in the small waiting area. To go orders are not allowed. CASH only. Service was incredibly fast.",4
"Cash only!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_(one star taken off for that)I think people still line up for Daikokuya because it's cheap ($10). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen was ok, but the broth wasn't as rich as ones such as Ippudo or Toto in New York. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The portions are huge, however (and an egg is included). If Daikokuya was a fried rice place, however, I would give it five stars. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The fried rice ($8) is perfectly charred and wonderfully flavored (very fatty though!). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Even though they don't do take out, if you don't finish, you can take the rest of the food back with you.Pro tip: I actually think it gets more crowded around 8 when the parking is free... My sister and I came in at about 8:15, and it was still about a 45 minute wait (on a Wednesday night).",3
"I eat here waaaay too much - No joke. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is my true ramen love. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When I eat at other ramen places, Daikokuya is The Benchmark I use to compare all the others.

ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Daikokuya Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles in the ramen are just the right width and cooked just the right amount of time to deliver a perfect noodle with just the right amount of chewiness. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth - words cannot explain the full pork flavors and complex but subtle tastes in a seemingly simple soup base. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is not easy to make and they have mastered it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All the other ingredients work well together (although I ask them to go easy on the green onions). The pork rice bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This thing is shredded pork and so the flavor of the sweet soy based sauce works in so well and is just simply delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Save some room in your belly for this worthwhile dish. I hate the long wait and impossible parking but I'll still see you tomorrow or real soon I'm sure.",5
"Big portion, the two of us got a combo of ramen and pork cutlet rice bowl with a cabbage salad, tasted good. Place is a bit too small for groups though, the six of us had to be separated into 2 tables",3
"If you asked me 6 months ago, I would have said this place was the best. But then Anzutei opened and opened my eyes to rich ramen that didn't make you feel like a salt lick.Daikokuya is delicious. The noodles are perfectly chewy and the broth is rich. Just never refrigerate it because it turns solid due to fat content and will hurt your soul. The prices are good, but it is CRAZY busy. Love this place, but the amount of water you have to drink to balance out the salt, sucks. And sometimes, I'm just not down to battle the lines. Also - cash only, which means I can't just go there, I have to plan and get cash out, because let's be real, it's 2016, who carries cash regularly?",3
"This place probably wins for having the longest line at all times. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's a small restaurant, spotted by the yellow awning.

ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The only downside is that you can never come here on a whim or come here hungry because of the wait.The service here is ok, somewhat rude. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They will make you wait for your entire party to come before seating you. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I came here late once from work, and my friends had already gotten seated, and just had ordered. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The waitress looked at me when I sat down and told me I could not sit here because I was late. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was super rude! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_She then told me I could not order anything as well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After that, I decided I wouldn't spend my money here and my friends simply shared their food with me.

"This was my first time trying a ""real"" Ramen place. Because we all know that the minute ready ramen just doesn't cut it. If you're coming here, expect a wait of at least an hour as this place is always getting good business. You do have to write your name on a list and be called when a spot opens up, however I think the wait was worth it for a first experience. The staff is extremely friendly at all times and the small ""mom and pop"" shop elements of this place makes you feel like you're completely immersed in Japanese culture in Little Tokyo. Ramen isn't something to have everyday, but once you try it, it will definitely go onto your list of cravings to fill when the time calls for it. To my knowledge they only serve two types of ramen, the regular classic and the spicy. All the food was exceptionally good and the staff was very friendly. Again, expect a wait and make sure to leave as soon as you're done to make room for all the people waiting! Authentic elements and friendly staff are the standouts of this location.",5
"The wait was horrible, the ramen was too greasy and I got sick of it after the first bite... The worst part about it is that I got food poisoning as well... Literally 5AM I run to the restroom and throw up for a good hour. I don't know, I guess it's different for everyone, I just don't think it was worth the wait and now that I have food poisoning, I'm in bed with Gatorade as my best friend. TRUST GUYS, I'm not a hater, this is my first time giving a place one star... If you're the type that get sick of greasy or creamy food, this ain't the place.. ONE STAR FOR THE SERVICE THOUGH, the man was pretty kind.",1
"Can I get my Daikokuya from 2005-2007 back? 4 stars down to 2.5, with a roundup to 3 I guess since I'll continue to patronize it on a rare occasion.You'd think given the ramen boom in L.A. that the old standbys would want to step up their game to handle the competition and stay relevant. I'm getting the feeling that Daikokuya (of which I've patronized both the original and Sawtelle locations now) is content to slide by on name recognition alone. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The tonkotsu broth is lacking a little punch now to where I absolutely need to get it kotteri style every time. Cutting corners? There were rumblings on the Chowhound board years back that milk was being added. I can still eat it, but my disappointment lies more with the gyoza. Ten years ago this place would absolutely nail it with the gyoza, which I think is some of the best gyoza I've ever had. Every time since 2009 I've returned to L.A. to eat it, it has been some bizarre burnt misshapen mass of something resembling gyoza, with a bunch of scallions thrown on top as if to hide the horror of seeing what I'm actually eating. It's like there's absolutely no pride anymore to deliver a quality product. I'm not exactly big on munching on overfried dough to get to the good stuff. The fact that it's happened every single time I've returned to Daikokuya after originally moving away from L.A. leads me to believe that this is the accepted standard of quality. The quality hasn't just decreased-- it's nosedived. But it's like that hokey quote in Brokeback Mountain: ""I wish I knew how to quit you."" I'll still come back and risk it and hope it'll be the way it used to be, like the way it looks in some of the photos I can find on Google Images. But now every time I get what looks like a reject from a new person in the kitchen, it'll go right back to the kitchen with a request to take it off of my bill. Enough is enough already. And there are so many ramen options now that offer a better overall product where I don't have to wonder if something will be prepared well or not.",3
crazy wait time but totally worth it! prices are super low budget and flavor of the food is amazing. Too bad Sacramento ramen places are not as good.,5
Rated as the top ramen house in LA on MSN's list of best ramen places in each state. This place is amazing and lived up to its reputation of great food and quick service. Went here on a Sunday afternoon so the wait was not as bad. However during the later hours it gets pretty hectic. The restaurant is CASH ONLY so come prepared there are signs everywhere. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had the Daikokuya ramen combo that came with a side of salmon shashimi over white rice. Fulfilling and flavorful it's a must on the ramen bucket list of places to eat.,5
So good. We had the ramen on one of the hottest days this summer and it was delicious! The noodles tasted so fresh and cooked to perfection.,5
We waited an hour...but the ramen was really mediocre. I don't understand what the fuss is all about.,2
"This place seemed pretty hype - I was outside, having waited ~15 mins as a party of one, even a little after what I would consider the dinnertime rush. I was actually a big fan of their salad (and the dressing!!) and the miso soup. I had gotten a pork belly rice bowl - the portion was very generous, but the pork was too salty and overly seasoned. Also, I like pork fat, but there was just a little too much of it in my bowl. The atmosphere and wait staff were wonderful, though. I'd probably go back, but I'd get something else.",4
"It took months to come back and get in, but it finally happened, and my tummy is happy because of it. There were 13 groups ahead of my girlfriend and I at noon on Valentine's Day weekend, but the wait was only 20 minutes. Walking in, you see the worn-down booths, grimy counters, and discolored, faded advertisements. Slurping emanates from every direction as steam pours out of an ad hoc kitchen behind more grimy windows. It's the perfect place to sit down and lunch. Home. We ordered a California roll (very well-priced at $6), takoyaki (legitimate takoyaki made fresh when ordered), the original Daikokuya, and the spicy miso. Heaven in a bowl. Rich broth, flavorful pork, springy ramen noodles. Cash only, people, so bring your stomachs and a wad of bills. You'll thank me later.",5
"I want to say that Daikokuya has fully reaped both the benefits and the poisons of the Yelp Effect, but I can't. I want to say that Daikokuya is hyped up beyond any reasonable measure, and standing in line for it will not be worth your time, but I can't. I also want to say that there are much better ramen joints back up in good ol' Norcal... but I also begrudgingly don't think I can.Every time I visit Los Angeles I try to make it out to one of the ramen giants downtown (Daikokuya, Shinsengumi, Orochon, etc.) but most of my friends that live in LA have either all been there, or don't believe in standing in line for food. It was probably by a stroke of blind luck and/or divine providence when I just happened to be walking down ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_1st St. and noticed that there was no line in front of Daikokuya; confused, I looked at my watch, and double-checked that they were ten minutes away from opening -- I also had to check on my phone that today wasn't a rest day for the restaurant, and then pinch myself to check that I wasn't dreaming.Sure enough, ten minutes later Daikokuya opened its doors and I was the first one in at the end of the counter. Having read Yelp reviews on the joint about a million times meant that I knew exactly what I was getting and I was sitting down with my chopsticks in hand by 11:06. The Kotteri-fied Daikoku Ramen or any of its variants will not change your life, and if you've ever been to any decent ramen establishments across the big pond, it's really nothing comparatively special. But that's precisely what makes it amazing -- people seem to walk into Daikoku expecting a tonkotsu/pork bomb in their mouth with every scoop/sip of the broth, but instead what they get is a mild, more subtle (almost light) infusion of pork just enough for people of all age and gender to enjoy; if Daikokuya envisioned creating a ramen that would serve as the neutral standard from where other ramen would branch out, (for example, anything more fatty than the Daikoku Ramen would henceforth be known as ""fatty"", anything saltier, as ""salty"", etc.) then they have created just that. On a more specific side note, I also like that they use straight egg noodles which also tends to give the broth an extra mild flavor, and all the toppings contrast the texture of the noodles very well.My dream is now to one day die of congestive heart failure by eating the Daikoku Ramen + Fried Rice set with a side of Gyoza and washing it down with some quality beer from the bar two doors over, after running a half-marathon in the blazing Southern California dry heat. Let my epitaph read that I lived as kotteri as I ate.",5
"I was with a friend in the Japanese Village Plaza and we wanted to try Daikokuya because of the great reviews on Yelp. It is only about a five minute walk from the plaza which was convenient. The restaurant itself can hold about 20-30 people. There are a bunch of Japanese ads and stuff on the walls and they make it feel like you're in Japan! Lol.And thank god we went here on a day where it wouldn't be as busy as it usually is. When you walk in, you put your name on the list. There were a few people waiting to be seated so it took about 15 minutes for my friend and I to be seated. Sometimes they don't call you by your name, but by the number you are on the list, so make sure to listen for it! The waitresses there were also very nice and energetic.I ordered the signature Daikoku Ramen and so did my friend. The noodles had the perfect texture we both liked, and the broth was amazing. It was a bowl of pork fatty goodness! The egg in the soup was perfectly boiled and the char siu was cooked perfectly as well. I honestly don't feel like Daikokuya needs more rave reviews, but it is a great place to stop by and get some good ramen. Just some warnings, it gets a little hot in there and that it is a CASH ONLY restaurant.",5
"I feel like a black sheep for giving this place a solid three stars, but it was just an okay experience for me. Pros:Service: the gentlemen taking the order and the ramen chefs in the front are super nice people.Rice Bowl: I enjoyed my chicken rice bowl over my bowl of Daikoku Ramen. My rice bowl was steaming hot filled with plenty of chicken and eggs smothered with their yummy house made soy sauce. Cons:Broth: I personally did not like the taste of the broth, it was too rich and fatty for me. I even tried some of the spicy miso broth and found that to be too oily as well. Wait times: Even though I didn't have to wait, I can tell the wait time for a table is horrible considering the place is small. Even though I didn't wait, I lined 45 minutes before they opened so I get on with my day instead of hoping for a table to be open.Anyways, if you haven't had a bowl of Daikokuya ramen, it is really worth the wait to see if it suits your taste buds. I saw people next to my table literally pouring the entire bowl down their mouth, but then there was me where I could not finish mine.",3
Ramen was tasty! the egg was fresh with soft inside. Although we waited for about 40mins. Worth waiting!,5
"Honestly we out here. We out here waiting two and half hours to try this ramen. We waited. We did it. We had the full experience. Now let's get into the review. I gotta be honest here and start off by saying I'm from Dallas, so honestly what do I even know about ramen. I enjoy ramen shops, and I walked in expecting to have my jaw drop to my ankles. I expected to take a bite and be transported to Tokyo sitting in my students uniform staring out the window bored waiting for my waiting for my anime adventure to start. Instead of such a journey, I ended up having a bowl of ramen. Now let's talk about the food. First off let me say that this ramen is rich. This soup will tell his father on you. This soup will rock a supreme shirt with yeezys and a vineyard vines pullover. This soup was so incredibly rich that I got sick of it. I'm not sure if I'm just a food peasant, and I didn't appreciate the incredible richness. The meat was forgettable and the noodles were normal. I might be missing the fire factor of the richness of the broth, and I think that this experience flew over my head, and I am really lost in the hype.",3
"Small, crowded with an outrageous wait. So by the time I was seated, I was ready for some out of this world ramen! I was let down. It wasn't terrible, but I expected better. My advice, take a walk down the street and grab some ramen at Shin Sen Gumi.",3
To start it off it was my first time coming here and honestly to start it off the service is not all that they were pretty rude. They had attitude while I took my time to order my food. The food was good I had just a basic daikouya bowl. The noodles and the broth were perfect but what really killed it for me was at the end of my dinner the waiter asked me and my group of friends for a bigger time and demanded that we tip more.,1
This place is good but not sure if it is worth to wait for 1hr+.....their Tsukemen and salad are pretty good.,3
"Walked passed this place and saw a crowd so I just had to try it. I love ramen noodle! I ordered the regular and spicy ramen noodle. Both of the broth tasted the same. The spicy ramen was not spicy at all, which I was a bit disappointed. What's the point of paying ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_$1 more if you are not going to make it spicy? Overall it was okay, noting to rave about. I still prefer Ajisen Ramen.",3
"I'm hungry for late night ramen. Daikokuya is the epitome of good Japanese ramen. I brought a pair of first time here on a group date and they excitedly ordered the daikoku ramen. I ordered the beef bowl and small hot sake. My boyfriend ordered the daikoku ramen with the ikura bowl. The beef bowl was everything I wanted it to be, thinly slice beef cooked with onions over white rice with a side of pickles. The meat is tender and it's juices dripped all over the rice. It's definitely got that home cooked feel. I took a bite of the ramen and as expected, it was up to par. The ikura bowl was totally lacking for the salmon egg to rice ratio. We hardly had enough saltiness from the salmon eggs to distribute evenly with the rice. Overall, the food is excellent. My friends were very happy. My only complaints are about parking (we couldn't find any, broke down ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and paid the $10) and the wait time at midnight was 40mins!",4
"Best ramen I've had outside of Japan. Although I live in Northern California, when I get to SoCal, I try to come to Daikokuya to get a delicious bowl of ramen. Service is great and moves at a normal rate. Last time I went, we wrote our names down, but were seated within 15 minutes. We did go earlier (before 6) to avoid the rush, so that probably helped a lot. Food is superb. I still dream of Daikokuya ramen and eagerly await the next time I'll be in SoCal. The broth has the right amount of seasoning, and is perfectly made with the bones and seasonings. The flavors are great. Also, the quality of the ramen is the highest. Some ramen places let the noodles get too soft and mushy, but Daikokuya does it just perfectly. With a little give and chew, it's amazing. Don't be scared of the line. Come earlier if possible, you won't be disappointed and very very happy and filled with the best ramen of your life. I wish there was as good of a place here in NorCal, but until next time SoCal!",5
"This place is pretty good. Long wait, but that's a given at any great authentic ramen spot.Only thing I didn't like was that you can't change or substitute meat. I always order Tonkatsu ramen since that's my favorite but I usually only like to eat it with chicken, but at Daikokuya they don't do that at all or even have a vegetarian ramen option. Maybe that's just how authentic ramen is which I could understand.....but then again we are in LA...so it'd be nice to be able to have other options.This was good and I had to try it because people always rave about it but Silverlake Ramen is still my chosen ramen place!",4
"My friend and her boyfriend were in town from Sydney, Australia, so we met up in LA. Both being big fans of ramen we decided to check out Daikokuya. Parking is a b*tch. We circled round Little Tokyo a few times before we found a tiny space to squeeze my car into. Apparently this place is a Yelp top 10 restaurant and as a result, there were a LOT of people waiting to eat. We put our name down, walked around a bit (although, at night there isn't much to see), and then headed back to wait. The inside of Daikokuya is a little divey, but I liked it: made it feel more homey. Itadakimasu:- Daikoku Ramen ($8.95)I was a little surprised that a place known for it's ramen only has one ramen option. But, I guess, quality over quantity, right?My friend and I decided to split a bowl since this was only to be dinner part 1. We got the Kotteri flavor, soup extracted from the back fat. We both thought the ramen was pretty delicious; however, we also both thought it could have been even richer. The noodles were pretty good, as was the pork. Overall, a pretty tasty bowl of ramen.Reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating: I've had better ramen in the States. That said, Daikokuya is a good place for a solid bowl of ramen, as long as you don't mind the wait.",4
"Absolutely delicious! HUGE servings, so the price and the taste is totally worth it (none of my family members could finish the bowl). Since it's really popular and it's a cute, tiny place with limited sitting, be prepared for a wait. Once you get there, sign your name on the waitlist and make sure the whole party is there when they call you.",4
"It's dumpy inside but when I am on the PMS train, this is the only thing that will satisfy me for Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I lived for a long time 1 block away so it was easy walk over, put my name on the list, estimate how long it will take then walk back in 45 minutes to an hour. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Now I do not live that close and it is a bummer. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Rich broth, good beer, tight quarters and cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ I think it is worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My brother who quite a bit of time in Japan said it's very good but not the best he had in Japan. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Well for me, it's my best. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So 5 star for you Daikokuya",5
"Horrible service, we had to wait for 1 hr to wait for a table. Place was packed at 1230am on a Saturday night so don't expect to get seated right away if you are in a hurray.",2
Thursday at 5 pm = no line. Score! Tsukamen is the way to go. The pork was grilled which made the fat and meat extra tender and melted in your mouth.,5
"The hubby and I took an impromptu ride on the Amtrak down to Union Station and strolled over to Little Tokyo in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After walking around and finding unique items in the shops, it was time to have a delicious dinner. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There were so many choices for dinner! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Where was the best place to go? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Then, an idea came to me:CALL ONE OF THE RAMEN MASTERS!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I decided to text Cathy S. because she is very familiar with the L.A. area. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_She responded in a flash with three choices, but Daikokua topped her list. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The eatery filled up fast, and was full by 5:30PM. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We waited for about a half hour, but the flavors were well worth it! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We both got their Special Tonkotsu Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles were cooked to the perfect texture and the broth was rich, creamy and earthy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork was tender and savory. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_We shared an order of ""Tsukemono"" Japanese Pickles that included selections of daikon, cucumber and takuwan radish with shiso leaves. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Very interesting and delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_I liked that they had shredded garlic available as a condiment at the table. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The service was friendly despite how busy they were. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This Ramen stop is not to be missed on your next visit to L.A. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But please take note, they don't take credit cards! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Cash Only over here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And they don't accept to-go orders. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Strange, but I figure they get really busy and have limited space, so they concentrate on their dine-in guests.",4
"My first taste of Japanese ramen started with Daikokuya many, many moons ago. The ramen in piggyback fat broth got me smitten, even to this day. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_During my short trip to little Tokyo in L.A., I knew I had to come back here for that ramen, even though we had to wait 2 hrs in the line just to get in.Ordered the Daikoku ramen and eel bowl combo for $17.95; superb combination! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It also comes with a side of cabbage slaw.I wasn't too blown away by the ramen; it was not as spectacular as I had recalled. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Maybe my preferences in ramen have changed (matured? evolved?) over the years as I now prefer it with a twist and their ramen was a little basic. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was thick, milky and luxurious with perfectly soft boiled eggs while the noodle itself was firm and springy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I found it tasty, but certainly not worth the 2 hr-long wait to have it.The unagi bowl, on the other hand, was delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was straightforward featuring thick cuts of eel with that oh-so-sweet glaze over a delicious bed of rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All in all, the eel prevailed yet I was satisfied with being able to relive a good memory at Daikokuya once more.",4
"This used to be my favorite ramen in LA, but it seems to have fallen down in my rankings.*Make sure you go to the Little Tokyo location, I feel like the other locations don't make their ramen as well.PARKING: Sucks, hah, being in Little Tokyo you probably have to pay for street or metered parking and walk a bitWAIT: Crazy long. The place is pretty small with only about 5-6 booths and counter space, the list to put your name down is usually at least 10+ people in front of you, even when it just opens. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They try to go by quickly but usually I just put my name down and roam around Little Tokyo until I get called.FOOD: They only have one type of ramen really, the Daikoku ramen, which is basically like Tonkotsu and pretty flavorful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Soup - You can tell they put a lot of ingredients in their soup base and cook it for a while but on a scale of intense flavor it would only rank around a 6.Noodles - Thinner than I would like, and sometimes it's acceptable if the noodles are chewy but the noodles were kind of flat.Egg - Disappointing, I remember it being more soft boiled but the inside was pretty much like a normal boiled egg.Pork - Fairly tender.ATMOSPHERE: Reminds me of a retro Tokyo bar, with different posters and memorabilia around the restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The bathrooms were located in the back and the restaurant does have a homey/old feel...I think they got a B or C rating.Overall, this is a good place for people who like good ramen, but I wouldn't say it's the BEST in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait can be discouraging, but I'd say it's worth to try at least one for ramen enthusiasts.",3
"This place is pretty legit. Only the ramen is worth ordering as everything else was just ordinary. However, the ramen is done exceptionally well. Definitely one of the best ramen places in the US.",5
"Everyone knows that if you want a good bowl of Daikokuya ramen, you need to go to the one in Little Tokyo. Be aware that free parking is hard to find and you will have to wait. I only come here when I take public transportation or when I'm in the area to do something else.There is pretty much no arguing that their ramen is good. The flavor of the broth is excellent, the noodles are done right, the chashu is tasty, and the bowl is pretty big. The one complaint that I have is that I prefer my bean sprouts to be cooked a bit. They pretty much serve them raw as they as extremely busy and just trying to knock out the bowls as fast as they can. I usually get my bowl as a combination with the ikura rice bowl.Bring cash and your patience. They don't accept credit cards here and the typical wait will be at least an hour. But it is this Yelper's opinion that it is definitely worth the wait!",4
Idk whats the hype of this place lol ramen was just average ramen.. i have had better ramen before.. tempura was average also lol nothing special,2
"My best friend and I went on one of our notorious food adventures again yesterday (Bottega Louie for macarons, this place, crepes and Japanese street food WHILE waiting for Daikokuya, then shaved ice and boba afterward), and we decided it would be worthwhile to wait for this place, as she had heard very positive things about it. Overhyped places almost always disappoint me, but this was fortunately not one of them. We ordered takoyaki to share and each ordered the Original Daikokuya ramen. - Takoyaki was great - not the best I've had (the best thus far being in Japan, which kinda doesn't count, as well as Honda-ya, a place that specializes in Japanese tapas), but it was still very solid. Came with a decent (although not generous) amount of octopus, and it came out piping hot, warm and gooey on the inside, and crispy on the outside. I also loved how they didn't overdo the sauces (which tends to make the takoyaki soggy after a while).- Ramen: Holy mother of all things good. The beauty of this ramen was in how simple yet delightfully rich and flavorful the dish was. I've gone to other places that go ham on the toppings (cod roe, fish cakes, dried seaweed, etc), but this place kept it really simple: broth, noodles, bean sprouts, a few bamboo sprouts, green onions, charshu pork, and an egg. The broth was very rich and extremely flavorful. Almost wanted to drink the whole thing except I was too full by the end to do so. Comes in regular, half size, and large. Service was polite and prompt. Left paying only $14 for my meal (including tax and tip). Also, this place is CASH ONLY. If this place was closer (and the wait wasn't so long), I'd DEFINITELY be a regular.",5
"It was good but not worth the long wait. It taste like any good ramen place. My review may be bias due to the ridiculous wait but if you do not mind waiting for 30min -1hr, you should give this place a try. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And bring cash!",4
"While I'm not convinced that this is the best ramen you can get in Southern California, it is still probably the best you'll find in Little Tokyo. The ""Daikokuya ramen"" is the standard here and you can opt to get it in one of their awesome combinations if you have the appetite. I always choose to get my ramen ""kotteri"" style which is a much richer version of the original broth. The flavor is absolutely amazing, even better when you add some of the puree'd garlic and red ginger. The noodles are cooked to a semi-firm texture, which I think is perfect for any bowl of ramen. The chashu here is pretty good; It definitely has some merit to it, but can't say it's the best I've ever had. I could say the same for the fried rice and gyoza, which I thought were a lot better on previous visits.If you're in the area and don't see a huge crowd standing out in front, I definitely recommend giving Daikokuya a try; just remember to bring cash.",4
"This is a very popular ramen house with a long wait. Luckily I went on a day where it was only a one hour wait. To my dismay, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_it was not worth the wait. It was windy and cold the day I went, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_so waiting outside was not pleasant. There is only enough waiting room for about 8 inside and there was 3x that waiting. The food was not worth the wait at all. I have had much better ramen at the Marukai food court. It was a bit salty and the noodles were tougher than they should have been for a one hour wait. I waited that long, they could have taken a few minutes to make sure it was done right. The service and decor was their only saving grace. It was decorated in Showa era style, and very gracefully done. It definitely caught my eye. Our waitress was also very kind and curtious. This place wasn't horrible, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_but with all the selections of great food in the area, it's not worth my time.",3
"Come by 10:45, you will beat the opening rush and sit without waiting. Otherwise wait like 40 minutes for the first wave to pass. Spicy miso is a good choice but the tonkatsu ramen is my choice. The broth is a little too salty imo, but I think it still beats most ramen shops. The ricebowl combo might be too much, but if ur really hungry, it'll be perfect. As for me... as long as I can beat the wait, I can justify the hype. :)",4
The most delicious ramen I have ever had in my life. The broth was thick and flavourful. I love everything I had in Daikokuya. Also you guys need to try their house made dumplings. Never disappoint.,5
Just like everyone has been saying. Food is great! Will come back!! Visited here on recommendation from a friend and it didn't disappoint. You just have to wait a bit since the place is somewhat small.,4
"BESIDES the wait, everything was what I expected. I haven't even tried a ramen place yet. sad to say haha. I heard about this place and it already has 6000+ reviews, so needless to say. I don't think they need another review contribution from me, but I might as well. we put our name down and the list seemed long. so we walked around little Tokyo for a bit. came back 15 min later and walked around a bit more since we had a little more to wait. we sat down the second time we returned. my boyfriend said I had to get the original with extra back fat broth. that's his usual order. so I decided to go with that. my boyfriend ordered a LARGE, with the combination of of a side dish of teriyaki eel. my god, the bowls were huge! even a regular seemed intimidating. it didn't take long for us to get our food, it smelled amazing and I'm not a fan of extra fat in my food or pork. but I knew I had to go all out since it was our first meal of the day at 3pm-.- oops haha. the best part is definitely the broth, it was so flavorful and really rich. I was sad that I didn't get anymore than two small pieces of bamboo shoots(I actually like it, but my boyfriend let me steal one of his hehe). I didn't even finish my meal, I got way too full half way through. I was actually sad I couldn't finish and left at least 40% of my noodles and 80% brother. (I know, I'm a small girl with a tiny tummy). my boyfriend killed the large bowl and 80% of the broth, crazy. and the eel was actually quite good:) the bill came out to be a little under $40. which wasn't bad at all. I mean I would definitely return! even though the wait was a drag, but why not.",4
"Love. Love. Love.The best ramen that I have had in my life. A small place, usually with a huge line, but worth the entire wait. The entire restaurant gives off a very comfortable vibe, almost as if you were stopping by a good friend's house for some lunch or dinner. The menu is not huge, but has just enough for different tastes to be accommodated. They have rice bowls and various other dishes but the ramen is definitely the trademark of Daikokuya. I decided on the spicy miso ramen and fell in love immediately after tasting the broth. Incredible amount of flavor that compliments the noodles, meat, egg, and bean sprouts that you find in the bowl. A generous amount of food for the price as well.Officially now one of my all-time favorite restaurants, especially as an out-of-towner.",5
"If i were to ever drown in a bowl of soup, this would be the one. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is a reason why there are so many reviews for this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It must be because it's THAT good.Ramen comes with noodles, bean sprouts, char siu pork, bamboo shoots, soft boiled egg, and green onions. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I always ask for the koteri, which makes the soup extra rich. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Extra fat does seem to make everything taste better. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All the flavors of the ingredients seems to meld so well together. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've never been a fan of bamboo shoots or bean sprouts, but with this broth you could dip a tire in it and it would probably taste good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Put a dash or a handful of the spicy topping that they have on the side.This restaurant is a SMALL hole in the wall, so be prepared to wait. Sometimes even an hour or two. There are only a few booths set up and a small bar area. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I do think the waitresses do a good job of keeping things moving as quickly as they can though. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There isn't much waiting space inside unless you like being in claustrophobic corners. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I will continue to wait because no other Daikokuya location compares to this one. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The one in the city of Industry and the one in a random food court in Arcadia do not taste the same. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Again, you'll have to find yourself some street parking or park in a nearby lot.",5
"Nice place , we were fortunate to get here and not wait . at first i thought to myself that maybe some people were exaggerating when posting that , but it's true soon after we got tge last booth here they all all came . so . we go the spicy ramen soup , teriyaki chicken , frid rice and it came with some salad, yhe fam was a bit optimistic of tgis plase and in the end they liked it. I'm not an expert on this tipe of dishes si I'll go with 4 stars , i did see sime other ones that I'll go and try next time and take it from thete.",4
"DON'T GO! I normally have good appetite, but I couldn't finish only one bowl because it's too salty. I felt very uncomfortable after that. I often eat Japanese food and it's the first time I have this feeling. Plus, they don't take card and it's annoying. The atmosphere is kind of pressed, so there's no way I could enjoy it. One hour of waiting is totally not worthy.",1
"I will love Daikokuya til the day I die. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I hope on that day, I'll have my last meal on earth at Daikokuya, or someone please bring it to me. This poppin' place in Little Tokyo is the original location. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's so popular that there's a wait-list at 3pm on a Monday! Geez! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The inside is very very small. But then again, all of the stores nearby are all very small. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I usually get the special Daikokuya ramen with extra rich and creamy broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I won't describe much about my meal because it's something you'd have to experience on your own. ;)",5
"The ramen was good, and the service was fast and friendly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Due to the popularity and the long wait, I probably wouldn't prioritize this spot. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The sashimi was ok, wasn't particularly good tasting.",4
"It breaks me a bit to have to write this but Daikokuya's signature Daikoku ramen is not quite the bowl of ramen it used to be, even as its infamously long wait times have not subsided. On BOTH the last couple of times I've visited (both within the same month), I found the once gooey yolk of the ramen bowl's hard boiled egg now fully cooked to its core and even more surprisingly, cold. There is now also less of that excellent creamy Daikoku broth in the bowl but a bit too many bean sprouts than I remember having on many previous visits.I really hope that Daikokuya gets its act together soon....although the Daikoku ramen bowl is still a solid ramen experience, I have to say the diminishing quality of the bowl coupled with the long wait times have dented the value of the ramen you can from this place, especially with new ramen restaurant choices nearby.",3
"It's good !!!! try the Daikokuya special and add a few more ingredients, order some pork belly too. Awesome food !!!! It's easy to spend $15 to $25 for a meal. Look forward to going again.",5
"Prepare to wait.And wait.And wait.But know the wait IS worth it. My only mistake is that I didn't come to this place completely hungry, and I paid the price. The ramen selection is pretty diverse. I believe I got the Daikoku ramen (no fat added for me) and was very impressed by the taste. It wasn't too too salty and the noodles were nice and thick to fill my belly.Grab a beer while you're at it and enjoy a good time in one of the most authentic places in town.",4
I love this ramen place! Have been other locations like Monterey park restaurant. But this location has the best taste!!,5
"Ok, so I'm from the northeast so maybe my taste buds are a bit different. So this is probably one of the most popular Ramen places in LA given its Yelp reviews and waiting in line for 1.5 hrs to eat a bowl of ramen. The portions and prices is a good deal. However I thought the noodles were not hot enough and the pork slices was too thin and light on the flavor. The tofu nuggets was good. The octopus balls came out warm and it didn't have enough octopus filling. So overall it was ""ok"" but not worth the wait.",3
Great ramen and great service. Nice little place that won't disappoint. Seating in the bar area is interesting and entertaining. All the staff was very attentive and helpful. Wait could be long but the food is delicious,4
"Couldn't explain it any more then my stomach! Amazing! The broth so flavourful! Love love love, would definitely stop here again when ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_back in LA.",5
"It's 2016. Why are you Cash Only? Food is not as good as before. I think comparing to many new places, this place needs a little change up.",3
"Went here tonight for the very first time. We waited for about 45 mins but it's a good thing there are so many places to check out in Little Tokyo, the wait for a table was bearable. There are probably less than 10 booths inside plus very limited counter seating so I guess there will always be a wait especially during lunch and dinner rush. The place is really tiny and the size of it made me feel like I'm in a local joint in Japan, you know, like the ones I see in the movies (because I've never been to Japan lol).We ordered the Daikokuya ramen, pork cutlet, and fried rice. Their pork cutlet ($8.95) is pretty decent but it's just like every other pork cutlet out there. I wasn't expecting to be blown away by it though so it's not like I was looking for something special. The portion is huge, I only finished half of it. Their ramen ($9.50), on the other hand is tasty and pretty solid. I'm not really a ramen person and I consider Orochon to be good already. I would have to say, though, that Daikokuya ramen is better than Orochon. I actually liked the fried rice ($7.95). I could have just ordered it by itself and have a complete meal already. My pork cutlet bowl greatly improved because I ate it with the fried rice instead of the plain rice that came with it. I'm not sure if the wait is worth it. Food here is good and their prices are reasonable but I will probably only come back when I'm in Little Tokyo and if it just so happens that there is no line out the door.",4
"Passed by it a couple times and noticed the Disneyland line that forms outside at night so that piqued my interest. Dropped by again for lunch before the rush and was not disappointed. The ramen itself was cooked about as al dente as it gets for ramen, with a real nice pop to each bite. The broth itself was real flavorful and rich but not to the point of overwhelming. The egg? Boiled to perfection where the center was still runny and the cool center mingled deliciously with the broth. Waves of flavor washing over your palette. The portion like a movie that you didn't want to end, but when it does it ends on a satisfying note. All for an overall reasonable price.That being said, I do not think it's worth the wait that I've seen at times. If I had to stand in the lines that I've seen sometimes then it better be for something that lasts longer than a 20 minute meal.",5
"Well worth the 45 min wait on a Monday night! The restaurant is cash only, but if you forget you can get cash back from the Bruin gear store next door.The kotteri Daikoyuya ramen recommended on yelp was great, and so was the shredded pork bowl :)Best ramen I've had in LA!",5
"Try to avoid coming in groups larger than 4 as this place is cramped and is ideal for groups of four or less. Due to its popularity, it can get crowded. I took several friends here; all of whom have never heard of this place at all. I was wondering if this place would live up to the hype: it didn't. All my friends thought the ramen was either barely above average or above average. However, we all agreed that the broth was absolutely amazing. All in all, there are definitely other ramen shops that are good as this place and though this is restaurant is a gem, it's a place not worth waiting an hour+ for.",3
"I KNOW. I am probably the only person on Yelp that didn't give this place a solid 5 star. Is there something wrong with me? However, I can't help it--I'm just not a fan. I've had many people argue with me as to why Daikokuya is better than Shin Sen Gumi, but I just don't see it or taste it.The first time I came here was on a Saturday night, so as you can imagine, the wait was ridiculous. One of our drunk friend ended up sleeping in the car while we were waiting, and by the time she woke up, she was sober. That's how long the wait was. So we finally sit down in this crowded small restaurant, and we ate, and that was that. I don't think I experienced the euphoria everyone else did. As I'm writing this, I'm still thinking, what is wrong with my tastebuds? Haha...So after that, I didn't visit Daikokuya for a while. Then ended up here again with another friend. The line wasn't too bad at this time, as it was right after work. Again, I really tried to enjoy it but I couldn't. I kept thinking about Shin Sen Gumi...To me, Daikokuya is kinda like a guy who is so good on paper, but you just can't manage to like him. All he does is remind you of how much you love the other guy (in this case, it's Shin Sem Gumi).So there you go. My 3 star review on this highly raved place. Tooks balls to do this~ Not even going to explain the parking situation and etc., because you can find that probably in someone else's 5 star review.**NOTE** from what I remember, this place was cash only. Not sure if its still like that, but just incase, take some cash~",3
"My bf and I tried this place first one night because I was really craving ramen and have been wanting to go to this place. I loved their ramen so much I had to take my cousin and her bf who were visiting from NY about 3-4 days later and sure enough I got them hooked, they even wanted to come back their last night in CA but they were already closed. Let me just tell you.... this place has got me craving ramen every single day (which btw is very unusual of me bec I crave diff things every day) and ever since I tried this place, I just really wanna eat here everyday but I can't because I'll be broke ugh AHHHH it's just so good. They probably put some special potion in the soup that gets everyone hooked. Let me talk about the RAMEN- (stomach growling as I type) they serve it w/ fresh noodles, very tasty, creamy yet thin, salty, pork broth soup like a lot of great flavors mixed in to make this divine soup. the sliced pork is so soft, it just melts in your mouth and the boiled egg is perfectly cooked not hard but not very runny yoke and when you take that first bite, you'll seriously go loco. Ugh, can you all just try it? I'm hungry now.. Anyway, CASH ONLY and expect a long wait, because DUH everyone loves this place. You have to go inside and put your name down on the wait list. There's also Chase bank nearby.",5
It's Little Tokyo! Obviously the ramen here is authentic! I had the specialty Daikoku Ramen for $8.50 with no regrets! The broth is heavenly and I love the toppings that came with it. Come hungry and leave happy. I promise you will not regret it. I pinky swear. :D,4
"If you are a hobbyist of ramen, this place is not for you. Their ramen is below average, much lower than my expectation. If you came here for its fame, I am sorry, you would disappoint.",1
Broth and noodles are good! Everyone we take here who hasn't had ramen outside of the packages loves it and is an immediate convert.,4
"We came here on a Thurs night (after going to the MOCA's free Thur nights). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was jammed packed... We put our name down on a list and went to a couple of bars...We came back to only realize that she had already called us, but she accommodated us (and said that we'd be next).We sat down and ordered a couple of combos for the four of us, and a couple of apps - one katsu and another fish dish.Everything was delicious esp the ramen - the broth is deep and rich (so he like lighter broths, this place isn't for you). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Also, the noodles are very hearty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The servings are not large but they make up for it in flavor.Not sure that I'd come back again given the wait, but I thought it was worth it.",4
"I've enjoyed ramen from better places, but this place is not a slacker! Very flavorful broth and soft chashu (like it should be). The fried rice side is suuuuuper good, I don't know what they put in it, but it's like an explosion of flavor. Soft boiled egg could be better, but I won't slump them for that (most people would, a ramen place is only as good as it's soft boiled egg). Anyway, pretty good place, worth the wait to try once. Maybe even twice. But probably not thrice.",4
"Yum! I love coming to Little Tokyo, being in this town makes me excited to eat ramen. Seeing the reviews on yelp, I told myself I must try this ramen house! And I'm glad I did. The wait however of 80 minutes on a Saturday night, was a little too much... but almost worth it. The place itself is small, barely many tables which is why the wait takes forever. The waitresses were very friendly when serving you. Once I say down I felt happy and ready to eat! I got the signature bowl. Ramen was perfectly cooked. Broth was slightly plain in my opinion, but nothing a little bit of chili powder can't solve. The melt was melt-in-my-mouth perfect. I definitely think the ramen here is good, however considering its wait.. Makes me want to come here less. Maybe when I'm in the area again, I'll be back for the spicy miso.",4
Soooo this was the first ever restaurant that I actually waited over an hour for and let me tell you it was way worth it. Amazing amazing noodles. The ramen was out of this world. Better than anything I have ever tried. To be honest I will wait Again for their ramen. So good.,5
"Yeah, it's good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Yeah, you could wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_No, don't go in a large group. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Yes, their ramen is excellent. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And yes, even their non-ramen items are A+.That's.. pretty much it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I wouldn't recommend more than four people and don't come here when you're starving because you'll have to wait, especially if you come on a weekend. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Shin Sen Gumi is comparable and delicious, but Daikokuya is definitely a treat.",4
"Wow are you serious with the wait, actually because of the wait we found this other spot a couple doors down, some sushi spot, and man I'm glad we didn't wait and just ate sushi, but guess what, I left my name on the 50 name list for this Ramen, so after we were done with sushi, we decided to see where our name was, and hold be hold, only a couple of names so we said screw it lets see whats the hype is all about, and man was I glad I didn't wait to eat cause the Ramen wasn't all that wait, I've had way better with shorter waits. This place is not worth the wait. Just gonna go where I usually goBecause of the long wait we wouldn't have discovered Sushi Enya, thanks you guys and your long waiting list",2
"Daikokuya is super hyped in socal. It's definitely a Ramen place you must check out if you're ever in LA. I had the Gyoza to start and the Daikoku Ramen. The Gyoza were pan fried and sooo delicious, I would go back just for these! The Daikoku Ramen consisted of tonkotsu based soup, egg noodles, boiled pork, kurobuta pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and green onions. OMG this broth was amazing, so savory and flavorful. I think my final check to see if a broth is good is to wait and see if I get thirsty afterwards... gladly I didn't. The pork belly chashu was so tender, it practically melted in my mouth. The marinated boiled egg tasted like it was soaked in the broth overnight to soak up as much flavor as possible. The ramen here is really something you need to experience for yourself. Try to arrive early in the day, the wait can get pretty long if you come around peak lunch/dinner hours. Don't forget, its CA$H ONLY!",5
Looks like a dump from the outside but the food is to die for!Worth the long line wait.,5
"I did not know what ramen was, Daikokuya showed me. Never been to Japan and I'm no ramen expert, but the hype is real. Great food. Small place.Long line.",5
"The line here is unjustifiably long. The ramen is a little above mediocre for LA tonkotsu (competition is getting thick...). Not really sure why I'm reviewing a place with 5000 reviews...Anyways, the rice bowls are super yummy. Definitely better than the ramen! Daikokuya has arguably the best fried rice in existence. But still, waiting an hour for fried rice is just never worth it.Do yourself a favor and go next door to Marugame Monzo where it IS worth that hour.",3
"First, I'd like to say that there's always a wait so make sure you sign your name in and wait...Second, this is one of the better ramen's I've tasted. Slightly salty but still yummy~",4
"The ramen is okay in my opinion. It is pretty hearty and savory, but not as mind blowing as we expected. Not sure what's the hype about. I would only suggest to go in if there's only a less than 10 mins wait.",3
Not very happy with the fact I placed this spot on my list. The thousands of reviews and I was just disappointed. The wait staff is not very friendly or understanding. I made a mistake and order what I thought was chicken fried rice for my 4 year old and they basically didn't want to exchange it they gave us a hard time about it and we had to end up paying for it and for another bowl of actual fried rice. The bento box I had wasn't that great. I have California rolls and teriyaki chicken. Didn't enjoy them at all. I'd never seen a California roll with some pasty salad meat. The actual salad was whatever as well and the miso soup wasn't that great. Maybe it's just me or maybe is that I've never really had authentic Japanese food.,1
"I saw this on Yelp before I came out to California for my vacation and even bookmarked it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There was street parking as well as garage parking nearby. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The restaurant was very small but super busy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think we only waited like 20 minutes or so for dinner because there was only two of us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We sat at the counter which was a little cramped but definitely fine if you ordered only one thing. I ordered the Daikoku Ramen + small chicken teriyaki bowl combo ($12.50) which came with a salad as well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My dad ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen + small chicken teriyaki bowl combo ($12.50). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I believe it was the same price but just swapped out the Daikoku Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We also ordered a Tuna Roll ($5.95). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We waited a few minutes before we got our salad and the Tuna Roll. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen came out soon after along with the small chicken teriyaki bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen bowl was pretty large so I guess my eyes were bigger than my stomach. The Tuna Roll was good and prepared well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The rice wasn't mushy like some place I've been to. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The salad was like any other salad to me. lol ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Daikoku ramen was pretty delicious and I was very full afterwards. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My futile attempts to finish the small chicken teriyaki bowl was good but not enough to finish it all. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I only ate about half before I stopped trying. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was also good in my opinion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'd say everything was very good and I'm not sure if there were other ramen places around LA that were good like this or better. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I just went with what was on Yelp. lolOverall, waiting for 20 minutes or more for some ramen was worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If I'm ever in LA again, then I'd stop by for my ramen fix. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Awesome!Cash only!",5
This ramen place had been highly recommended by several people and I am glad that I went. The place itself is nice and quaint. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's quite popular so there may be a wait. But it's worth it. Ordered:Gyoza - piping hot goodness. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Great flavor. Spicy miso ramen - Easily one of the best ramen i've eaten. Great flavor and perfect bite on the noodle. I prefer a spicier taste and so thankful for their chili oil that's available on the side. The chashu pork... yum!I will definitely be back. Great now am craving it. Parking: street or lot. I opted for the good ole gold line.,5
"I would say more on the 3.5 side. This place is CASH ONLY so plan accordingly. I have to say this is one of the more hyped ramen places in LA. I still think it pales in comparison to Tsujita, jidaiya, and even Shinsengumi. The lines here get pretty crazy, so I'd recommend either coming at an off time or late on a weekday. The value here isn't the worst you can get a combo for about $12-17. The Tsukemen is definitely nothing special here, if anything it gets boring. The regular with kotteri broth is more memorable. Comes with plenty of toppings. I'd say it's worth coming here every now and then, but nothing to write home about. (Good, but not great)",3
"OK, the food here is so amazing that I gave this place 5 stars despite the long wait at times. I am so picky about my ramen and this is one of the few locations that I find to have the perfect noodles and delectable broth.Anyway, this place is always busy. My sister and I have even dropped by 30 minutes before the shop opened and as soon as we started a line, it got two shops long before the place even opened. Is it worth the wait? Probably not when you're dying of hunger but if you can wait, it's worth it especially if you can walk around for an hour.Also, the best time to go is like 2-3 when there are less hungry people",5
"I went to Daikokuya for lunch this Sunday afternoon. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place is small and always has a long line, so get there early if you don't want to wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It opens at 11:00am for lunch, so get there by 10:45am or be ready to Facebook while you wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered what Daikokuya is known for which is their Daikokuya Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_One of the best I've ever had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I also ordered a side of Gyoza (Japanese Potstickers). Everything was delicious. This place is small, no thrills, parking sucks, and only accepts cash, so I took off a star. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But as far as food goes, it rules!",4
"First of all, I don't eat pork (only pepperoni.. .is that Kosher?)Most everything here has pork.I guess asking for no pork on Ramen ia like a asking for no grapes on a glass of wine.I loved it and you can taste the almost crÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©amy flavor of the broth.I recomend you do a thorough menu selection on their website prior showing up, because you are not going to have much luck asking to many questions....it's like ordering at Canters in Fairfax but with much younger servers.Order, eat it, love it and get the hell out of the place since there are probably 10 couples waiting aside to be sited....on a slow day. This place has the top Rating in LA for Ramen",5
"Best ramen place in LA, its a little too small and crowded but definitely worth the wait.",4
"I am a Daikokuya fan. True blue, and hardcore. This location though is tough to love as much as the other locations because it always has such an insane wait outside! I'm pretty sure I waited as a party of two for over an hour on a Sunday night -- we went to Far Bar down the street to grab a drink after about 45 minutes and almost missed our name, but got back just in time.Nothing beats hot ramen on a cold night, especially when you can put a whole scoop of garlic in it! Oooooh boy it warms the soul. That Daikoku Ramen thoooooo yuuummmmmmmmmServers were super friendly and not at all pushy despite how crowded it was, and how many people were outside!!!Cash Only! So bring your cash, or be prepared to pay for withdrawing some change from the ATM in the back!",4
"Sometimes I wonder what the point is of writing another review for a place that already has almost 4000, but in the end, I just say screw it. My thoughts going into my dinner: I'm scared of how bad the line is going to be. I hope it's not too crowded. Don't overhype it. It may not be that good. How good can ramen be? Is this place really going to be worth it being on Yelp's list of LA's best restaurants?My thoughts when I got there and got seated: Wow, no wait!...granted it was only 5:30pm or so on a Thursday, but I was prepared for the worst. The menu was pretty small for ramen...there was only the original ramen...I didn't see any other specialty or fancy ramens that other places have these days. I appreciate that...stick to your roots Ramen house. This is a little pricier than I expected for a whole in the wall place ($8.50). I'm used to Hakata Ramen Shinsengumi in Gardena, which is my go-to ramen house...and costs $6.85. Don't get me wrong...I've also had more expensive than $8.50 so I wasn't complaining, so just an observation.My thoughts after the food:I'm glad we ordered the gyoza and the ramen...a respectable spread. Gyoza was some of the better ones I've had. I don't know if I'd say it's the best I've ever had, but it's up there with great gyozas. The broth in the ramen was awesome. It was missing something originally though, but they brought over spicy oil and chili sauce at my request. A few splashes of the oil and squirts of the chili sauce and we had some bomb ramen. Highly recommend that technique, but don't worry...no need to thank me.All in all: great experience. It didn't blow my mind, but about what I expected. I don't think it was a game changer, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself. For a large beer, gyoza, 2 bowls of ramen, the bill was $28 something...so pretty cheap too.",4
"This is the original ramen restaurant in L.A.The atmosphere is rich with vintage history, and it is definitely cramped, but this is expected when you're in an early 1900s spot in Little Tokyo.You'll spend around $10 per person if ordering ramen. However, the wait is always at least an hour.I give this place 5 stars because all of the negative things cannot be improved. You cannot change the size of the space, you cannot change the high demand this place has- therefore the long wait.But it is definitely worth it if you want to taste the original ramen of L.A.!",5
"Bomb, bomb, BOMB!!! Went here for the first time last week. We were starving so the wait didn't look to good, but it was definitely worth it!! Try the dumplings",5
Best ramen ever. There was a little wait but totally worth it. The rice bowls were okay. Nothing special to it.,5
The ramen was great and corns and eggs are fine. I wonder why there is always a lot of people waiting outside from morning till midnight. It was good but not that 'good'.,4
"After going to Wexler's Deli, Nickel Diner, Bronzed Aussie - this was our last stop in DTLA and we save the best one for last and also because there is always a long wait here - and it didn't matter what time of the day it was. When we arrived we saw about 10 people waiting - I thought well it's going to be at least an hour wait - personally I wouldn't wait but I knew that my brother really wanted to try it - so we went in. I placed my name on the wait list around 2:15pm and also asked the waitress how long would it take - she said about 20 minutes but I was kind of skeptical because I saw the people waiting outside - - However the wait was surprisingly wasn't as bad - it was only about 25 minutes like the waitress said - I did see however a lot of the names on the list that were between us and some other party ahead of us crossed off...so I'm guessing some people just left. Lucky for us. The reason for the long wait anyways is because this place is so small - fits about 35 diners at most - they have 6 booths of 4-5 seaters and a counter bar that sits about 14 people so that's why it's such a long wait. Anyways, I was pretty full so I decided to share a combo platter with my boyfriend, whereas my brother ordered half a bowl of their signature Daikoku ramen. It's nice they give you that choice of full or half bowl too - cause even if I didn't eat, I usually can't eat the full bowl and the left overs are usually not so good anymore - maybe that's why they don't allow to-go or take out - it will change the way the food taste during that travel time. I didn't want the soup so I ordered the cold noodles with everything on the side - so the meats and veggies and soup are all separated and I love this idea cause sometimes you just don't want a steaming hot bowl of soup - especially since it's 90 degrees outside and the AC isn't very strong. The combo comes with a bowl of rice with shredded pork. It's a good platter to share if you don't eat a lot.While I ate the tasty noodles and drank a few spoonful of the delicious rich flavorful broth, my boyfriend ate the rice - which he said was also really good and saucy. The service was okay - the waitress that served us most of the time wasn't all that friendly - but another waitress was more friendly. They only have about three waitresses since the place is so small. Overall, I have finally tried this ramen place at this location and it's not that different from the other location I guess - except maybe the food that I had. I like the food here better. but service is the same - so-so quality - in all honestly in my opinion I do not think it's really worth the 1.5-2.5 hour wait cause I'm sure the other ramen places around are good too and there's a lot of them here in Little Tokyo.",3
"The spicy miso ramen is creamy hot delightful, super good for a hot day and perfect for a overcast rainy day.",4
"In Reno, I was considered the Ramen Queen. Anyone had a question about ramen, they'd ask me. I'd like to say that this means everywhere I go I try their ramen...but considering I was in Austin for at least five days and not once went to Ramen Tatsu-ya....I fail.BUT, I was brought to Daikokuya, wholly unknown to me because I wasn't living down in LA, and was pleasantly surprised. Their tonkatsu broth was rich, creamy, and slurp-tastic. The noodles, chewy and al dente, and the vegetables well cooked. You can get a combo with rice and...something else - usually my friends get unagi.Only come here if you're okay with waiting in line forever. Or if you want to spot celebrities.",4
"Does this place deserve 2 stars based on food and service alone? Probably not, probably more like a 3, decidedly mediocre. However, considering the half an hour minimum wait and the fact that they show off their top ten of Yelp status (from 2011) right when you walk in, they lose another star for failing to meet expectations.So between 2011 and 2014 I don't know what happened. I must confess I didn't come here in 2011, but there must have been a quality dip because there is no way this ramen is worth a top ranking restaurant. The ramen was very...oily? Is that the right word. It was a very fatty broth, which didn't taste terrible but was very middle of the road. I also got some mixed tempura, which was some of the soggiest tempura I can remember (and I remember all my tempura).Service was decent I guess? Unmemorable definitely, just like the rest of the experience. I am the disappoint. Will not return.",2
"I came with two friends on a Saturday night and wrote our names on the clipboard at 7:20. Seeing the crowd huddled outside, we went elsewhere and came back around 7:50. It was cold, windy, and soon our legs were aching and we were wondering if it was really worth the wait.Then, at 8:30, they finally called our names and we were allowed to sit. Finally being able to sit down in a cozy booth is heaven after standing out for so long. I got the half-bowl ramen and the yakisoba. The noodles in the ramen were alright, but with the pork, eggs, vegetables, and broth, it was wonderful and warmed my bones. The yakisoba was excellent; I could be slurping some down and I'd taste more of the barbecue one moment and more of the vegetables the next. Also, if I knew what sauce they put in the salad, I might just learn to love eating salad at home.My legs were still sore from standing, though, and remained that way when I got home. My friends and I wondered if they keep the crowds outside for awhile to make coming into the restaurant and eating that much more satisfying. Definitely come at a less crowded time.",4
"My favorite place to get ramen,i usually go with my wife as soon as they open its a bit of a wait but the service is always great and fast. Trust me the food is worth the wait, especially since its cheap.",5
"OK, this place is ok. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ All hype. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ For me, the broth is too thick with fat for me, gave me a stomach ache. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ I think that's why people like it and how they like it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The noodles are al dente, just how I like it because it leaves the noodles low-glycemic.Service and food are on par. [=",4
Went here a while back but I keep craving their amazing spicy miso ramen. Everything about it was perfect. I keep dreaming about the day that I go back to LA to have another bowl of this delicious ramen. Now I don't think I'll ever be satisfied with any other ramen.,5
A really good place to eat if you don't mind the wait. I wanted for about 40 minutes before being seated but the line gets short fast because people get tired of waiting. It was quick to order and be served. I highly recommend the house special ramen with Kettori which is extra fat on the ramen. Rich in flavor and the Sephora beer was awesome!,4
"So, I've tried my fair share of ramen.This place was crowded, line was super long (at 11pm?!) but it was delicious. The broth was super flavorful. A good amount of pork, bamboo, egg...everything was tied so well. Completely yummy. The noodles were cooked very well!I loved this little joint. Please note that the wait time is long. I got spicy ramen and I thought I'd be sufferin' some severe heartburn but it wasn't spicy at all. Spicy tonkatsu ramen. Delicious!OH yah, please note it's Cash Only! There's an ATM inside.",5
"Fantastic place! Hands down the best ramen I've had in a long day, I think the last time I had a ramen this good was in Japan. We took a spontaneous trip to LA for fun, yelped around and saw the number of reviews for this place so my girlfriend and I decided to check it out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Our wait was about an hour, so we walked around Little Tokyo and explored a bit. We came back, got seated and everything looked good on the menu, we had the Gyoza, Spicy miso ramen and they were beyond delicious, it was like ramen from heaven. The soup was perfect, and I loved how everything has extra fresh green onions on the top. My mouth get watery everytime i think about this place. Highly recommended and the hour wait was well worth it!",5
"This is the best Ramen in LA! The food is perfect, the service is fast and on point. I will definitely be coming back.",5
"Came here on a Saturday night around 9pm and there were about 8 couples ahead of us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We expected a long wait so we walked to the little tokyo strip mall across the street for about 25 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The entire wait wasn't more than about 45 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We sat at the bar and ordered pretty quickly and the Ramen came out quickly too. We didn't feel rushed at all though. The waiter and waitresses were kind and courteous. Our waiter had the cutest accent too, hehe. As for the Ramen: the noodles were chewy and the broth was thick but not too rich and creamy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I enjoyed the simplicity of the ingredients and the authenticity of the flavors. The chopped green onions were freshly sprinkled on top of the Ramen. The chausu was perfect and the addition of corn just added a bit more texture. One aspect of the customer service stood out to me, even though there was a long wait outside still after we were done eating, we were never rushed to pay the bill. We took our time chatting and digesting and left when we were ready. I appreciated the freedom to stay a while and didn't feel like a number!",4
"I absolutely love the Japanese culture and I just HAD to grab a bite for some delicious ramen. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and to my surprised, it came in a large bowl with plenty of noodles, a soft-boiled egg and a nice balance of bamboo strips and pork meat. Walked out with a full belly and complete food-coma. DELICIOUS! Totally worth 10 bucks a dish and the wait for the food, highly recommend this place if you happen to be around for some wonderful Japanese food and goodies!",5
"Had an amazing date night in Little Tokyo which started with a craving for ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I chose Daikokuya after reading the review of one of my favorite yelpers Roland L. who never steers me wrong and I absolutely loved this spot. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Thanks Rols! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen was absolutely delicious, and not just in your typical comforting hot bowl of soup kind of way. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This was well prepared, well seasoned, mouth watering yumminess. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ It was the art of Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Seriously. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't mean to over sell or exaggerate, but I haven't enjoyed a $10 meal this much- EVER, and actually can't wait to get back here... The meal started with the most delicious gyoza I've ever tasted. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Gyoza are Japanese style dumplings and you have to order them if you dine here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They were authentic, fresh, and delectable. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have this thing for spicy food so on the recommendation of the waitress, I ordered the Kichi-Men. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is served in three dishes: a deep bowl of the exquisite hot and sour broth, a plate of cold perfectly cooked noodles topped with savory dry seaweed, and a plate of shredded chashu pork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You then build your bowl of ramen by dipping the noodles and pork into the hot broth, and when its done you dip more... I enjoyed my ramen like this in like two or three servings. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Kichi-Men is a new version of their dipping style Tsukemen, for those that have eaten here before. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Anyway, it was absolutely heavenly with just the right kick for my spicy palate. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My meal came with fried rice on the side, or I accidentally ordered it that way, but in any case, it was not necessary. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Even though the rice was delish too, its a lot of food and way to many carbs :-) ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ My Bichon Ginger got to enjoy the rice when I got home. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_She loved it! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you have a big appetite get the rice, if not, the Ramen is suffice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya is a quaint adorable diner right across from the Village Plaza in J-town. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Japanese hipsters working here, the general appearance of the crowd waiting for a table, and the Japanese kitschy decor give this joint a cool funky appeal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is now one of my favorite spots and definitely a must try next time you are in DTLA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Trust. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Food: A+Ambiance: AService: APrice Point: $$Perfect place for a a casual lunch or dinner for two. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The space is small so I wouldn't recommend it for groups larger than 4-6... **Cash only! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tanoshimu! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_(means 'enjoy' in Japanese) :-) xo Dre",5
"10 STARS! Best thing I've ever eaten. This was the highlight meal of my 10 day LA trip. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Do yourself a favor and get the Kotteri broth. It tastes like someone just melted a pig down and served it to you as soup!Be prepared for LONG lines and a wait time of over 1.5 hours during peak times. There's a small shop nearby where you can sit and play scratch cards and try to win some money to pay for your dinner.I definitely am putting this on my ""MUST"" list when I travel to the LA area.",5
"Solid 4 stars. The food is 4.5 and the star.They aren't spending profits on decor and ambiance here. If it was a bit more updated, and by updated I mean air conditioning, I could probably be swayed to bump this up to five star. The ramen. Oh man. I didn't grow up eating ramen and have only been to a few places to have it. But as far as I am concerned the daikoku ramen, kotteri style is the bomb and my favorite ramen. I could eat it a couple of times a week easy. Spicy miso is also very good, but the depth of flavor in that kotteri is, wow...and that egg! I love the ooey gooey goodness with all that yummy flavor. Yes! Kurobuta Pork is tasty too. I am salivating as I think about it.I have tried the sashimi combos and the fish is pretty good, but other that that I can't comment on other aspects of the menu. I will try more as I return, and I will return.I have been here a few times and the wait times can be absurd. Also a factor of why I didn't bump it up to five stars. Thankfully my smartphone can keep me entertained while I dream about brothy goodness though. Service is pretty good but make sure you pay attention to your number. Your ass will get skipped if you slip. Cash only too, folks. In conclusion, if I had to drown to death, it would be in a bowl of ramen from Daikokuya.",4
"After reading all the reviews, my adrenaline was pumped for this place. Antipcipated to come here for 2 weeks....... ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is my expression after trying their Dakoku ramen : Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€__(Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ‚¬Ã‚Â£Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ‚¬Ã‚Â£;)Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€__=3=3=3I can't even finish my ramen. Kotteri did make the soup richer. The noodles... I don't know if it's me but it's not chewy nor Al Dante.... To me.. It's just uncooked noodle..... Raw noodle or the noodle inside cup noodles.The cha su, I don't even know how to explain it.. Its just mediocre.... Really really not special...Overall... Its just bland...The gyoza is only okay... big though when served it smelled really pungent and bad to me..Soon after..my boyfriend wanted to puke and I...just had diarrhea........ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_/ (ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¡Ã¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒ_ I really wish I did not waste $30 for the 2 ramen, salad and gyoza......This is overrated.. It's not worthy of all the good reviews. I can't believe how people can say this place is delicious or is the best. Clearly they dont know better...or they are just ignorant..my Latino boyfriend who is new to Asian food know what is good and what is bad...As I'm typing this by the rock fountain in the Japanese village .. My boyfriend is screaming in pain and I'm just...wanting to have diarrhea again... Please reconsider going to this place. I believe the people... Who rated 5 stars for this place must really be newbies... Or.. Americans..... (Not trying to be racist but.........I don't know how to describe better..)I don't trust yelp reviews anymore.. I've stepped into too many traps....Salva nos!!!",1
"Does Daikokuya have a lot of history? Yes. A lot of loyal fans? Yes. Does it live up it's bolstering honor? Not really. The whole cash only thing is also very inconvenient. It's always about 40 minutes wait on average. There's only 6-7 tables plus a few counter seats. They wont' seat you unless your party is present. Since only two tables can be made into a bigger one, big parties will be hard to accommodate. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Now, to the meaty part......the ramen. I ordered the Daikokuya ramen with fried rice as a side. The bowl was massive. There was enough ramen and broth for two people. The flavors were a mere shrug though. The ramen was a bit too tough, perhaps under cooked or over starched. Once I was done with the egg, it felt tedious getting through the ramen. The fried rice? Oily and I could have done better at home.I believe this place is all about the hype. The broth is a-ok but there's a ton of other places that are better. Not a fan and you won't find me waiting an hour for this place ever.",2
Best ramen in town. I love this place's food. There is usually a 20-30 minute wait but its totally worth it.,5
The Top notch ramen spot! Great cabbage salad (dressing!) Fried rice combo always a wait but totally worth it,5
"Amazing! Long line usually but I got right in since I was dining by myself. Best broth, fast service. I left happy and full :)",5
"Came when it opened, so no wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ordered the pork broth ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles and chashu were excellent, but the broth tasted like they added too much flour/corn starch, always a turn off for me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I like the rice side dishes you can add.",3
"Great no-frills place for ramen. I loved the in house gyozas, very different from the frozen supermarket packs NYC ramen places tend to have. The ramen was good too, great firm noodles and the char-sui just melts. Wait wasn't too long and the food came out quick on a Saturday afternoon. Definitely come here for your ramen fix.",5
"Awesome place for beginner ramen enthusiasts! I like my tonkatshu broth with the extra fattiness to it and served with hard noodles.I believe that Daikokuya is a step above Shin-sen-gumi. Yes, Shin is more friendly towards customization, but I'm more for the simple line up of garnishes, and meats.I still believe that both places have their noodles from frozen, but that's just me.",4
"Has loved their ramen all the time until today we found a small piece of plastic bag inside the soup at the end of meal. And it happened after we paid. We didn't bother to make any fuss about it, especially my husband is super forgiving. Undoubtedly, the taste of the ramen and soup is still the top. But the hygiene turned me off. Very disappointed:(",1
"So good! Broth was nice and thick, very flavorful. Wait is pretty long, but there are a lot of places to see and look around, so time goes by pretty fast.Itadakimasu!",4
"This is hands down my favorite ramen store ever! I always end up comparing every other ramen shop I try to Daikokuya!!!FOOD:If this is your first time, definitely get the combo with Daikoku ramen! I always ask for kotteri (pretty much pork fat) broth because it tastes extra hearty and leaves a satisfying flavor behind! The ramen comes with a soft boiled egg and thin cuts of chasu. You also get a cabbage salad with a thousand island-y dressing on top and it is bomb dot com! For the side dish, I would recommend the pork bowl (pork is fried in egg), fried rice, eel bowl, or salmon bowl! TIPS:- Cash only- Put your name down on the list inside- The wait can be super long so come early!",5
"Wow. This place rocks! I knew the wait times were going to be long so my buddies and I went to a sake bar a few doors down and had some drinks. Then we went to check if they had called us and they had not yet. We were two names down so we chilled out. It wasn't a long wait. We sat at the bar and were amazed at how loud it was in there. There were a lot of people in a small space and the atmosphere was cool. It smelled great in there with a mix of the broth and bento plates. We did not have to wait long for our ramen at all. It was very good. However, I do not like the egg so I gave it to my friend who gobbled it up. I had the pork chashu tonkotsu ramen and it was awesome. I tasted what true ramen was all about. The noodles were thin and firm, the broth was unlike anything I've had. It was rich and fatty- not too salty like the miso soup at Orochon. I was a little dismayed that this was a cash only establishment. The server (who was chatty and polite with us) told me that there was an ATM at the back of the restaurant. Day saved. We filled up for less than $20 which is common for most ramen restaurants. I will go back, but I have to be in the mood to go to that area since there are a few other ramen restaurants that are a little closer to me than this one. If I go here, it's to explore and gorge myself on the other cafes like Mitsuru and walk around the marketplace.",4
"Thick, rich, flavorful broth. Al Dente noodles, fresh ingredients, tiny hole in the wall, rude service - What's not to love about this place?Simply put, it's probably my favorite ramen join in LA.",4
Quite possibly the best meal I've ever had in my life. Shredded pork combo. I was full but forced myself to keep eating. This place is spiritual-experience level. It took a while (45 min.) to be seated but I don't care... I'd wait 2 hours if I had to. Every other meal I have will be compared to the SPC.,5
"This place is pretty good, workers are kind, and the portion is huge! Downside is waiting can be super long specially for bigger parties. So just come here during none rush days and hours",4
"Daikokuya is a staple ramen shop in Little Tokyo - having been in the area for years, it has built quite a reputation on its signature broth and perfectly al dente ramen noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Visiting here there's a few things you'll notice:1. the line - there is always a big one; expect at least 30-40 min wait any time of the day you come2. there are other things on the menu besides ramen...but everyone gets ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_but that's because daikokuya specializes in ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their broth is pretty epic - super buttery and it has the marinated taste of stewed pork bones and miso. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can get a fattier version as well, called ""kotteri"" for some artery clogging, mouth-ecstasy goodness, which I highly recommend. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_3. it's no reservations and cash-only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is a remnant of the older times in LA when credit cards were a hassle for the businesses.4. the food comes out very very quickly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_don't worry about the long wait - average time for me to get my bowl of ramen each time i go has been about 8 minutes, no joke.5. you can customize the ramen! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_my favorite toppings are corn, butter, and extra chashu - which makes it like a sapporo-style dish. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_it goes perfectly with the already buttery kotteri flavor and fills my belly with happy.As probably read from previous hundreds of Yelp reviewers, the food here is amazing and draws crowds from all over. If you're new to Japanese food and ramen, start with some takoyaki (octopus in a breaded/fried batter ball), a heaping bowl of kotteri ramen, or tsukemen (noodles outside of the broth, with the dipping broth a bit thicker), and soak up some steam and Japanese culture while you listen to others slurp their noodles happily next to you.Here's my overall score:Food: 5/5Price: 4/5 - it is actually pretty price reasonable for ramen in the area, but it's cash only, which is super lame in 2015.Service: 4/5 - long waits, but service is speedy, yet not overtly friendly like most placesAtmosphere - 4/5: old school Asahi beer ads on the walls throw you back to the 1970's.Overall: 4/5. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Great job, Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is my post-kendo practice fix when I'm hankering for ramen!",4
"What happend to this place? I think this place switched owners one too many times cuz quality went way down. If you like your ramen very salty, then this is the place to go. Its a shame this place is in little tokyo, the interior is dirty (bar area), food is super salty, forget about the hype, this place sucks. Definitely not coming back.",1
"*A good bowl of ramen. A little bit overhyped considering the average wait time can be over an hour, depending on your group size and the time.*Recommended food: Daikokuya Ramen bowl with kotteri flavor* * *I have passed up Daikokuya many times because the wait has always been ridiculously long (an hour or more). Finally, I decided it was time to give this place a try since I was coming in for a late lunch (or early dinner) at 4 PM. An odd hour that would surely mean the wait would be minimal, right? Not exactly. For our party of 5, it ended up being nearly an hour wait.But long wait times isn't necessarily the fault of the restaurant! In this case, definitely not their fault. So no stars shall be deducted from this review based off of the wait time. Now, let's talk about the ramen itself. If this is your first time at Daikokuya, it clearly makes sense to order their signature ramen with the recommended flavor (kotteri) that other Yelpers are all recommending. The price was fair, the portion was good, and the time from ordering to the time the ramen bowl was actually in front of us was good as well.I was a little bit disappointed at the ramen itself. I think it was hyped to the point where I was expecting the best ramen in the Los Angeles area. I wouldn't agree with that. I do think, however, this is a good bowl of ramen. The kotteri flavor gave the ramen broth a rich flavor. The noodles and meat were standard for good ramen houses, although I did think the toppings were a little bit sparse. Overall, I'm a fan of the ramen. I would not wait more than 45 minutes though for this ramen -- I think you could get better ramen elsewhere. If I come back, I'll be sure to try the shredded pork bowl everyone is talking about.",4
"The ramen here deserves some serious props! It gave me a flashback from my trip to Japan, it was a small restaurant, and the service was pretty good. Definitely a happy customer!",4
"Yes, there is a wait. Yes, the wait can be long. But it is worth it. I think I arrived about 30 minutes after they opened, but I still ended up having to wait a good 20 minutes before getting seated. Those 20 minutes were excruciating; it was hard to watch other customers devouring their piping hot ramen so deliciously. Wahhhhhhhh, I'm getting hungry just thinking about the ramen here. Seating in the restaurant is limited and cramped, which is fine because Daikokuya isn't exactly a place where you want to have a long, drawn-out dining experience. The waiters/waitresses are very speedy to take your order and the food comes out quickly as well. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 bowls of the Daikokuya ramen and 1 order of fried rice. The ramen broth is rich and full of flavor. The soft-boiled egg and noodles were cooked to perfection. And of course, the pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The portion size of the ramen was also quite generous. I was full off of the ramen alone. I was also surprised by the fried rice (which, by the way, is ENORMOUS). I didn't expect the fried rice to have such a strong, unique flavor. I have never had fried rice quite like the one they serve at Daikokuya. If only I could have some now :( ...",4
"Came here the other day after quite some time and the place was really dirty and smelled like a wet rag. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The back looks like someone's storage closet and it just doesn't look like they clean this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There was a layer of film on the tables and the place just looks really run down. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They added a ""sneeze guard"" to the bar but doesn't seem like they bothered to improve anything else. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Very sad and unfortunate.",3
"CASH ONLY!! Small restaurant, but so worth the wait! I came here at 6pm on a Monday and made it just before the dinner rush! The service is quick, but the food is so good! I got the Spicy Miso Ramen and it's definitely a rich broth. There is no take out, because I'm sure if it cools, the broth would just congeal................ but whatever. I walked here from downtown LA, it's a quick 25 minute walk and it's across the street from a cute shopping plaza which you can look around while you wait for your table. Things I ordered: Gyoza, Green Genmai Tea, Spicy Miso Ramen w/ extra bamboo shoot.Everything was delicious. The tea is a tea bag, not brewed themselves but still good. The spicy miso ramen wasn't overly spicy, you can opt to get it extra spicy if you're up for it. The Gyoza was nice and crunchy with a sweet-ish dipping sauce, very flavorful inside.",4
"Daiko-wha?!?! I can never pronounce the name right but yet their ramen is The Best!!!When I've noticed this place years ago in Little Tokyo, I always see a crowd outside and It makes me wonder what the buzz is about. Its like a club and you want to join in but Its not all dandy when coming here during long waits to be seated. Normally we would call in to check the line status because sometimes being in that waiting list you could be in for a dreadful wait, because this place is small. I order here most of the times their Combination : a side of Teriyaki Chicken Egg Bowl and their Daikoku Ramen which has an egg, bean sprouts, green onions, I don't know whats their secret in the broth but this ramen is boss! I cannot forget to mention the salad that comes with the combination that Sh*t is good and I ain't vegetarian!There is a small spicy shaker that they leave on the table and l like to overkill it with my salad, ramen and my chicken bowl!! If anybody knows the name of that thing please let me know.The staff here are very friendly they always yell out stuff in Japanese. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Im not sure what they say exactly when you hear them speak their native tongues but I always get a good vibe when they welcome us getting seated and thanking you when you leave. I notice that dude who works here, he's like the loudest one and he sounds funny because they enjoy what they do and they know they serve awesome ramen.It doesn't take a scientist to make good ramen, they do a really good job to keep their ramen home cooked than trying to be all fancy with all sorts of seasoned toppings, like other joints. They even opened other locations but I""ll stick with this location hopefully to get around the big crowds.",5
"We waited in line for everrrrrrr!! This place is quite small. There are a handful of booths for groups and a bar counter that people eat at. We were seated at the bar. The takoyaki - yummy!Spicy tuna rolls - decent!Ramen - ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I love the noodles! Broth was quite good as well.Pulled pork bowl - Good, but not too amazing. Can do without!I think I overhyped this place for myself since I read all the reviews as I waited here for about an hour and daydreamed about the ramen. We all got combinations and left with soo many leftovers! I would recommend if you're going to be getting appetizers, really strategize about what you all are getting. Maybe have 1 person get the combo while you and your friend get the ramen bowl by itself in a party of 3. You will not have space. I repeat! You will not have space! The yummy broth will expand in your stomach and it will be uncomfortable. lol They already include tip in their receipts btw!Overall, 3.5 stars.Would recommend? if in the area, yes! Shop around if the line is long, but don't just stand here for an hour and read Yelp reviews and wait outside. It will make the experience worse than your high expectations.",4
"Ramen wasn't that good, the broth is too salty. But the service is efficient and staffs are helpful.",3
"This place is a very popular ramen in LA, this is the first choice when you want to eat ramen in Little Tokyo, the place is long wait because it is very small but that's ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_a given at any great ramen. I always order combinations Daikoku ramen with small tempura bowl. The food is good but I pefer like rame in Thailand :)",4
"As a carless college student, I usually get to places earlier than I would like to because I take the bus and I would rather be early than forty minutes late.As it turned out, I was going to do a little grocery shopping in Little Tokyo so I took the bus... and got there earlier than I expected. But a few seconds of thinking and I realized... I could potentially get into Daikokuya without having to wait an hour!!So I got there and, though there was a small line outside, it was nothing compared to the horrific waiting lists I have seen at Daikokuya. After about ten minutes, we were let in. I sat at the counter and ordered the classic Daikokuya ramen. Within ten minutes, I got it, added some garlic, broke upon my chopsticks and started to slurp. The broth was nicely savory, the pork MELTED in your mouth, the egg took on the flavor of the broth and was excellent and it was a very satisfying ramen experience.So... why 4 stars? The price. I get it. Apparently this is the stuff of ramen legends here in LA, but as a half-Japanese person who has been to Japan and has had real Japanese ramen, it's alright. Very good for LA but typical for Japan. So charging $10 for a bowl is a little ridiculous in my opinion. But hey, it's Daikokuya, and at least I can now say that I've been there.",4
This place always has a wait but its totally worth it :]I love the super spicy ramen and the tonkatsu.,5
"CASH ONLY This place is ok for me. I like the other places in Little Tokyo more than this one, like Shinsengumi and Menoh. Another downside is that the wait here can get really long. I don't think it's worth the wait. I think from the Yelp reviews I really expected this place to be something special but in the end I was just disappointed. The food isn't bad but I just would not wait more than 30 min in line for it",3
"Long wait, but worth it! I'm not a huge fan of ramen cus my pops makes it this style all the time but the pork rice bowl was so good!!! Staff did keep peering over my shoulder. Tried to take my bowl away before I even started eating. Hold the train, y'all kept me waiting fo so long!",4
"This is still one of my favorite ramen shops. I love being welcomed into the tiny restaurant. Almost always a wait, so be sure to be with a fun group of friends or else you'll hate the wait.What never fails to disappoint: the shredded pork bowl. Question: what's up with their soft boiled eggs? They haven't been the ooey gooey texture I'm used to raving about :(CASH ONLY",4
Great little ramen house in Little Tokyo. They have three other locations in LA. Very friendly attentive staff with great service and quick delicious food,4
"House ramen - $8.95Alright. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'll say it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I loved the broth here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Probably the best broth I've had - BETTER than my favorite ramen joint (Yukinoya in Rowland Heights). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had low expectations coming into this place; I've been to Daikokoyua at Hacienda Heights and my experience there was horrible (2/5), but the food at this location was DELICIOUS. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_By the end of the meal I downed my entire bowl and was drinking some of my buddies broth lol.Let's make this clear - the broth is not healthy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's a heart-attack waiting to happen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's thick, fatty, and creamy (it's so thick you can't see the bottom of your bowl). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_What makes this bowl stand out from other ramen places are the green onions. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is also DROWNED in green onions (a favorite of mine). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Having said the above, if you don't like green onions, pork broth, and fatty soups (lol), this place is not for you.TIPS:-Expect a long wait time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We showed up at 10:30 PM and we had a 45 minute wait time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There's a bar next door called The Far Bar (about 3-4 stores down) that has cheap STIFF drinks ($7-$8) and great selection of microbrews (about $6-$8 a pint). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Prices are reasonable, service &amp; food are good; grab a beer and some wings while you wait.",5
"Went to daikokuya on a Friday night, and there was about a half hour wait to get a table (which is pretty good for what I've heard). The wait is 100% worth it though. The restaurant is situated in the heart of little Tokyo, so it's a fun, interesting, and very lively place to walk around while you wait. The inside decor of the restaurant makes you feel like you are actually in Tokyo, and the food makes you feel that even more. I had the spicy miso ramen, which was extremely flavorful and the broth was perfectly fatty, salty, and not too spicy, exactly how you want your ramen to be (I added a lot of spicy chili powder because I wanted more spice). I found that the broth got tastier and tastier the more you ate it... the fat on the pork was literally melting into the broth as it sat!! Such umami!!! The noodles had a perfect texture as well, and held up well as leftovers. The portion sizes are huge, I made two meals out of one bowl! They have condiments at the table for you to add like crushed pasty garlic, shredded pickled ginger, and spicy chili powder. Overall, I would definitely come back and order the exact same thing... it was THAT good!",5
"On a street strip where every other store front ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_is a ramen place, Daikokuya is definitely the most busy with a line waiting out the door and immensely delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Before heading out to the Mad Decent Block Party, the hubby wanted ramen and so onto trusty Yelp I was!The wait was about 30 minutes or so when we arrived around 11:30 am. We both ordered the Daikoku Ramen with the kotteri, which is back fat and yes, yes, YES it was necessary to add that tidbit on because it makes a whole lot of a difference in the broth. I am more so an udon lover than a ramen lover, but I must admit, I do catch myself daydreaming about this particular place.Best thing is, there are a total of four locations! I am having cravings as I write this ...xoxo Amy Nguyen",5
"This place has always been known for its long line. Came here late one night and literally had no wait!!! I've been here a few times before and usually have to wait 30-45 minutes so if you do come plan accordingly. I always get the usual, eel/ unagi with bowl of ramen. They never fail to taste delicious and this is my favorite place to get an eel bowl. It is a bit pricey but worth it every time and I always have left overs. Along with the set comes salad with their special dressing and boy it's a wonderful highlight to the whole meal. Next time I will buy the dressing to take home.",5
"My cousins from the 626/L.A. area had mentioned Daikokuya's ramen as we had a family gathering in Little Tokyo. From what I heard the only downfall was that the wait gets ridiculously long. But then again, good things come to those that wait (at least that's what Yelp reviews has shown me). Luckily, my friend and I had a 20min wait on a Saturday night!We both ordered the Daikokuya Special and decided to get the spicy tuna appetizer. Honestly, I didn't expect much from the spicy tuna but we ended up LOVING it. The appetizer was really light and the tempura shiso leaf melded well with the spicy tuna wrapped inside, and having it with the salt &amp; lemon was definitely a highlight for me. Wish there were a few more pieces of it though.Now to the ramen, broth is really good and very flavorful. Noodles were chewy and had a nice 'springy' consistency. Portion size is huge and it became a challenge for me to finish the entire bowl (and that is saying something!). Wouldn't wait 30+min for it, but for Little Tokyo &amp; Downtown LA, it's a solid ramen place and it's very cheap!",4
"Always a pleasure to come to this place. Food is always tasty and dependable. I've been coming here since they opened and they have never disappointed me. This place is awfully crowded at times so if you plan to come for dinner after 6PM, prepare to wait. ...for a long time!",5
It was okay! The tofu nuggets not so much but the Ramen tasted pretty good!,4
Always consistently good. I am never disappointed. I usually get the spicy ramen. Everyone is very friendly. They are cash only. I spotted an ATM near the restrooms last time I went. I usually try to come by myself as it is easier to snag a spot at the counter. There is usually a wait otherwise.,4
So savory. Dream of this place. It is worth the wait.,5
"Literally had ramen every day I was in LA while visiting. Daikokuya proved to be the best through our methodical process of scientific trial-and-taste. (HA! more like filling my belly until I couldn't eat anymore, digest, and repeat)While the kotteri ramen (with extra pork fat flavoring) was melt-in-your mouth delicious, I don't think I could have more than a few bites. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was very happy with my regular pork ramen, but my boyfriend hasn't stopped ranting about the kotteri ramen for months.I'm not sure if other Daikokuya locations are the same, but Daikokuya ramen is a must-go and definitely worth the wait!",5
It was our first time going to a Ramen spot. A friend took us since they raved about it being so good! It definitely exceed our expectations.The wait was about 40 minutes but it was worth the wait. We ordered takoyaki and fried rice as appetizers. The fried rice was definitely my favorite it has so much flavor! My boyfriend got the spicy miso ramen and he said it had a lot of flavor that at the end of our meal it was all gone. I had the daikoko ramen and it was definitely good. We would definitely come back again.,5
"There's like a million reviews already for this place already, (6k+) do I even need to input? Small little place, we checkin in at number 43, they are now calling 31. An hour later we got our seats at the bar. It can get pretty hot there esp we sat right at the end where the kitchen began. NOTE: I am not a ramen fan due to all the ramen places I have gone to taste like packages noodles. Who hasn't gotten sick of that during the colleges days?!?I've always gave ramen places chances, time and time again just cause there are always so much rave about ramen. I've just never had a chance to taste good ramen.I ordered the spicy miso, with charsu, egg, bean sprouts, nori and green onions. The ramen noodle was firm not soggy or soft like the others that has failed before this. The soup Has a little kick to it, didn't kick hard enough so I added the chili power which made it a lot better. The pork was soooo soft it almost melted in my mouth. Highly recommend this!Also ordered a side of gyozas. I love it, they first boil it, the pan fry, finally top it off with bunches of chopped green onions. I love the sauce that comes with this.The wife ordered the house special daikokuyo with kotteri, which is richer broth using the back fat. It was a little too rich for me and the wife, altho it was still delicious. It's like having too much butter, know what I mean? My wife ate as much as she could, being super stuffed and still was considering one last slurp! Lol she's in love with food.Parking: street, altho there's a parking structure across the street, 10 bucks tho! (Yikes)Dolla dolla bills y'all! (Cash only)Trivia: the three words on the place reading from left to right in Cantonese is ""dai hak ga"" which literally means ""big black family""",5
"The best thing are ramen &amp; gyoza as well the bad thing is actually too long to waiting for a line but it actually outstanding and no parking available so, let try",5
"I've been going to Daikokuya little tokyo for about 10 years now. The food is spectacular, as is the service (in most cases, with few exceptions) and the environment is comfortable and enjoyable. After bringing dates, friends and family to this location, I give it my highest recommendation. I'll be straight with you: the wait is gonna be at least 15 or more minutes, but your patience WILL pay off in delectable dividends. Do yourself a favor and try it out. Get the house ramen and gyoza.",5
"CA$H ONLYHot, fresh noodles!! delicious broth.. and they open pretty late too..I got the daikokuya ramen and added tons of hotness to it.. you can see in my pictures the before yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_ and the after yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The bowls are around $8-9 and if you want to do a combo its about $12-13... I got the noodles and fried rice combo.. and took the fried rice home... This place was so good, I woke up thinking about it and cannot wait to go back.. This place definitely falls under my top 5 ramen spots!!!",5
"Alright...I get why after 5k reviews, this place is a solid 4 stars! CASH ONLY. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_CASH ONLY. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_CASH ONLY. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Got it?Parking is metered street or parking ramp...or good ole fashioned walking :-)Space inside is really tight, this is not a great place to bring a group of over 4...there is literally not table large enough. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The booths are tight...so expect to be in someone else's personal space bubble...just say'in!There is always a wait (sometimes upwards of 2 hours), we ended up waiting 15 minutes #score. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The waiting list system is the honor system, where you write down your own name. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Inside, you'll find booths, a couple of tables and a long row of side-by-side seating (where you get to see into the kitchen). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Of course we were hungry and had to get gyoza and sliced roast pork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The gyoza was not super salty (which is what I find at many places) and the roast pork is laced with crack (OKAY, I don't think it is...but damn was it flippin awesome!). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Everyone in the group was gunning for ramen and we eat ordered the Daikokuya ramen and a couple of us got the combination (comes with salad and small rice bowl with choice of meat). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I myself got the combo with pork cutlet. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So...this is where my eyes were bigger than my stomach! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The rice bowl was PACKED with rice and about half a pork chop...but OMG was it amazing! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Hot white rice packed on the bottom with 3 large slices of pan fried pork, topped with a cooked egg...that was a meal itself. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen...oh man the RAMEN...top shelf broth, packed with crazy flavor and not thick (not soup thin, but thick enough it sticks to the ramen). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen itself had a good chew, clean flavor, tied with large slices of pork and a large cooked egg...#ramenheaven.If you haven't done so already...just go here for ramen people!!!",5
Yum!!! Cash only but their ramen is so good! I always get the house ramen and seating can be tricky at times! It's always so busy but sure as heck worth the wait!,5
"Though it doesn't need another review, I'll add mine since I was in the camp of ""I heard its good but surely it cannot live up to the hype"". It did, for me at least. A very large portion of ramen and green tea with tax and a 15% tip set me back $12, which for Los Angeles is very reasonable I think. Most importantly, the ramen was superb. I loved it. Very rich broth, great noodles, and plenty of pork along with a boiled egg and the typical veggies. Service was average, but they're super busy-- and honestly, this is a place you come to slurp up your ramen and head off, not linger over a fine meal. Would return for sure. Cash only. Plenty of paid street parking nearby. Remember to write your name yourself on the sign-in sheet. Some folks forgot and waited a while for the hostess while others jumped in front.",5
"I had the daikokuya ramen with the eel bowl. The portions are humongous, and the price is totally reasonable. My main gripe with this place is the wait. We had to write our names on the list a second time, because the first time the staff skipped us and there's no real designated host or hostess. Would go again. Honestly, this is probably the only place in LA that I've had ramen at.",4
"Yummy ramen authentically Japanese. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Great to pop in after a show at the center group theater, especially if you can find parking. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Portions are medium sized and they haven't changed the decor ever it seems. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But the staff is really cool. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You sign your name in at the entrance and wait to be called. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Prepare for a wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_People generally don't give up waiting even when famished. Cash only. My kids don't like the food but they're not really into Japanese food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So my hubby and I come here when it's just the two of us.",5
"I came on a Tuesday night around 930, and I still had to wait for 20 mins. I ordered the miso spicy ramen and I love the texture of the ramen! it's not the half transparent ramen, it's milky white ish color ramen. I personally love eating spicy food, this ramen isn't spicy enough. however the server gave me a bottle of spicy oil.I also ordered the gyoza, the presentation was one of a kind, and it was very nicely cooked. the only negative thing is that their pork slices are slightly too fat.... it was more fat than meat. but that's just me.",5
"My condolences goes to people who gave this any less than 5 stars. Your taste bud must be going awry. Tbh, for ramen this good (and have you tried the fried rice sides foodgasm yall) I have no care if they had poor service or long wait or cash only. This is one of the joints where it cant really be measured by how 5 star the customer service is. You come in, order your ramen, and go. If you want the waiters/waitresses to fake clown smile at you, chit chat, and flirt, go to hooters. Anyway, not to say that they have poor service. Service is good as far. They also open until like... 2-3AM. It's awesome.",5
i have no idea why there are so many people waiting in line for it. It is so ordinary. Ramen made by instant noodles. The only thing special is egg. It is worthless making a special trip to eat it. BTY youcan only pay for cash.,3
"The ramen was yummy, the broth tasty, and the pork just the right amount of juicy. I'd definitely recommend going on a weeknight when the wait is not as long.",5
DELICIOUS! Definitely get the combo. Their fried rice is AMAZING. The place is really small so be prepared to wait. I don't mind because it's worth it every time.,5
"SO, Daikokuya finally got on the wagon and made a spicy version. I mentioned in my first review that IF they made a spicy version, I would probably like it better. Nope. Didn't happen...The spicy miso ramen was super salty and the soup base got really thick mid-bowl and made it difficult to finish (for me anyways). I got the combo and chose the salmon bowl side. It was alright.. nothing to cheer about really. Pretty dissappointed with my meal...If I was planning to come back, would probably just stick to the regular ramen...",3
"Good ramen. A lot of people recomended this place for ramen and k finally got to try it. The ramen it self is pretty standard but when you add the kotteri it adds a great fatty, savory, game changing flavor to the broth. I wish it had a little more garlic and spice tho. But It's a four stars for me.",4
"Holy *beep* this place was super hot when I went. I do not think they have an air conditioning that is working correctly. It was quite a horrible experience. I found this on yelp with great reviews and took my parents there. We waited at least 30 minutes to be sit on the bar. I felt so horrible for the server who had to run around to manage the people in the freaking heat, and the cooks damn. I feel you man, the owner better be paying you guys well. I would never want to work in such environment, but I guess they are staying for the tips or something. Okay, and to the ramen. I got their signature ramen. I tasted better, didn't know what the big deal was, the soup was SUPER salty I mean it was pretty bad for me. But let me put it out there, that I am not an experienced seasoned fan of Ramen. I have tried a couple of Ramen places in Little Tokyo that I really LOVED, but this was not one of those places. And the HEAT! this is the message to the OWNER! FIX YOUR A/C! Your customers HATE (especially eating hot Ramen) and the poor servers. I will not be back.",2
"Worth going to just for the interior, which is set up like a Tokyo alleyway. The pork ramen is awesome and cheap, more than enough for two meals. Get an extra egg.",5
Wait was a bit long but that just testify how good this place must have been! The list can be daunting but it goes by pretty quick. Two corners with seating while you wait but watch out for the low lanterns... I hit my head a few times. Parking across the street in the garage was easy and relatively cheap. Staff was really nice and funny. I got the spicy miso ramen which wasn't spicy but it was still tasty. Big portion of noodles. I had to really push myself to finish it. It was good and my friend really likes it... So much she asked for my broth too so she can make leftovers at home lol. Never heard that one before. Cash only! There's counter space and booths. It did get a little hot being that close to the kitchen. This really hit the spot on a chilly day.,4
"prepare to wait before coming here we waited for a party of 2 and the wait was 40 mins, but i have to say the wait was well worth it i ordered the spicy miso soup and it was super delicious along with a teri chicken bowl really good, the staff are really friendly, the place reminds me of japan",4
I'm still a fan!Took a DASH BUS ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_to get here and it's great and fun experience.It was just a few minutes before 11am and they already have a line. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was great that wee were one of the first batch to be seated.Still in love with their salad and ramen. Bento box is a must to order for me.,4
"Ramen and shredded pork bowl was good, gyoza,sliced pork belly and fried rice were ok. Got there at 1045 first in line, 2 mins later there was 10 ppl behind us. Doors opened at 11 sharp. There were still people showing up and waiting as we left.",3
"Absolutely DELICIOUS!!! I've been here twice and I've only had the spicy ramen. The portion is enough for two people to share, $10 a bowl, but after waiting in the huuuge line you'll want a bowl for yourself. You can request to only have half the portion for half the price. Once you get called to a table the service is quick, we got our drinks and the food came about 5 minutes later. The two main cons of this place is the long wait, typically 2.5 hours or more on weekends, and that it's a 'cash only' place. Regardless, the food is worth it.",5
Health class is B i got ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_diarrhea from the ramen i cant believe all the hype about this restaurant,1
"This place is average, definitely not worth the 35 minutes waitI wanted to love it, but unfortunately (at least to me) it was not a great experience",3
"Yes the ramen here is as good as they say it is. It was delicious. The noodles and the soup were wonderful and the pork just melts in your mouth. I've had ramen at different places before, but this is just the real deal. We were sitting at the counter in front of where the chefs were making the food and I thought, this is what Naruto must have felt like. And now I understand why ramen is so good. The wait is about 30-45 minutes when it's crowded, but it's worth the wait! Best ramen I've had so far.",5
"I can't say anything else, but AMAZING! Their food is delicious and comes with great quantity. This has become my favorite Ramen spot. Too bad the parking is terrible, but what place isn't in DT/Little Tokyo?",5
"Came home for dinner on a Tuesday night, and brought my cousins here who were visiting from New York. Dinner was as expected, long wait, but delicious ramen. We had to wait about 40 minutes before we were seated, but right after they sat us, they immediately asked us for our drink preferences. Is like the waitress knew I was thirsty for some water. So that's a plus. We all placed out order when they brought the water back to us. The food is always great here. If you feel adventurous and have a bit of fat quota to spare, try their kotteri broth. Fatty, but bold and full of flavor! Overall, the experience was good. Great service and delicious food.",5
"One of the best ramen spots on it's side of LA hands down. Although I would rather have thinner noodles like Shin Sen Gumi down the street, that's just a matter of personal opinion, Daikokuya noodles are delicious in itself, the broth is what keeps me coming back. Everything about their ramen is on point. The broth, noodles and seasoning come together very well. I've long needed to make a review about this place so here it is. Oh yeah, don't forget about the bowls and other sides, they're all good.",4
"saw this place from a hotel window across the street. why so many people standing in line outside the yellow awning. so we tried it out and it's one of my best ramen experience ever. they make the food pretty much right in front of you. the decor and workers are fun. got the pork ramen with a fried rice combination. i was so stuffed. the pork, noodle and the soup is made perfection. i wish i can have this all the time. need to come back soon.",4
"Good lord, this ramen is heavenly. A friend and I were strolling down the streets of L.A. and I remember him telling me that this place had the best ramen he's ever had. And now I see why. It's so damn good. I had the daikoku ramen. All the ingredients were fresh and the broth is so flavorful. I was actually sad when I finished my bowl lol. The staff is really friendly too and the prices are very reasonable for how great the food is. One important thing to remember is that this place is cash only. You definitely need to try this place if you haven't already.",4
"4.5 StarsDaikokuya has been my gold standard for Ramen for many years. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Since having Daikokuya for the first time, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've had many inferior bowls of Ramen, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and very, very few equal or superior. I always stick with the regular Daikoku Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The serving size is more generous that any good Ramen place I've been to, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and the noodles are always a perfect, chewy al dente. The broth is savory and bursting with umami, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and it is not too salty or greasy. Even on weekdays, the wait can get really long. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_At a place with 5,000+ Yelp reviews, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_what else would you expect? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The restaurant itself is tiny and has no air conditioning. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's fine during cold weather, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_but when it's the slightest bit warm out, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'd say being trapped in a small, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_stuffy room with vats of boiling, steamy broth, sounds like a ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_bad time. But for delicious Ramen, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_you gotta make those kinds of sacrafices. Cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_First come first serve.",5
"I've been here twice and waited about 2 hours both times. Usually, if I wait that long, the food must be the most delicious food ever. However, that was not the case for this restaurant.Parking: This restaurant has no lot. You will have to find street parking or find a lot somewhere close.Service: Once you are seated, you are helped rather quickly. It's amazing since they are suuuper busy yet they have quick service. It's great!Food: I've had better ramen. I know ramen is not the most healthy dish, but seeing the oil on top of the soup really did not make me feel good. I've had ramen at another place that has the same strong flavor as daikokuya but without all that oil on top. I would definitely like this better without all the oil.Overall, I wouldn't go here again since the wait just isn't worth it for me.",3
"This hole in the wall ramen shop is by far the best ramen I've ever had! The hype is real y'all! This is especially if you are a ramen fan. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We got here right before the 7pm dinner rush so we didn't have to wait long. Keep in mind, this place is really tiny! It's tough for large groups to get a table. My boyfriend and I ordered the spicy miso and the Daikoku Ramen. For the spicy miso, the broth was flavorful since they use three kinds of miso for a richer taste. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The level of spiciness is mild, but since I like mine spicy, I added chili pepper flakes. It consists of egg ramen noodles, pork belly, one whole egg sliced in half, and green garnishes. For the Daikoku Ramen, my boyfriend got this and I really wished I got this instead of the spicy miso. Hands down, the BEST ramen ever! Make sure you ask for KOTTERI flavor which enhances the broth and makes it richer in flavor. I think this is what makes the ramen. I can't get over it!! Come hungry! The portions are pretty huge. Wished we lived in LA, I want some now!",5
"In Los Angeles these days, there is no lack of options when it comes to Ramen places. But as with many other genres, there is only one ramen to rule them all, and in the tonkatsu broth, bind them. And that ramen is Daikokuya. A delicious blend of rich, fatty pork broth, delicious noodles with the perfect amount of chewiness, and the price is right, bitch. It can get very crowded at times, and the broth can be too rich for some people (my mom doesn't care for it at all), but those are minor issues. I do recommend going with a party of 2 or less (i.e. 1), as the highest turnover seating is at the bar. Parties of 3 or more are often subject to long waits, as there are only a few tables in the restaurant. And before you think, ""this guy doesn't know what he's talking about, I know the best ramen place and its sooooo much better than Daiko"". Just remember that ramen, like pizza and burgers, is one of those things where everyone has their favorite. Well, this one is mine. Grade: A",5
Just look at the lunch/dinner waiting line. This place is amazing. Just make sure to set aside some extra time for the wait but it's worth it.,5
"The food here is absolutely amazing! My cousin and I both got the daikoku ramen along with an order of the gyoza as an appetizer. The gyoza was very crispy and had a layer of crisp meat on top of it. It was a very nice compliment to the gyoza. The ramen was great. I had added on corn and an extra egg (for a $1 each) and it was a nice combo. The broth was very rich, a bit on the salty side, but not too much. The meat was tender, yet fatty in the right places. The corn was sweet. The egg was nicely seasoned. The portion of the ramen was also huge. I finished about 3/4 of the bowl and started getting full around the 1/2 mark. All in all, this place was worth it, even after the hour wait.",5
"If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right...But seriously, is it wrong that I frequently think to myself during the day: ""I could sure go for some Daikokuya ramen right now...""?It's that good! This was my inaugural introduction to what REAL Ramen is, and I've been in love ever since. I like to keep it simple and have the Daikoku Ramen. I've never had something with so much simplicity have so much deliciousness. The broth is perfection, the pork is savory, the noodles are boiled just right. If I'm really hungry I'll also get a side of pork katsu, but the Daikoku itself is pretty filling. If you're not that hungry you can also get a smaller-sized version of it as well. Win-win all around!Now that you know of my love obsession, who wants to go get Ramen? Like right now.Tip: try NOT to go during dinner time or late at night if you want to eat immediately. Best suggestion is right when they open or during the middle of the day. Otherwise, anticipate a 1 hour wait.",5
"This food here is yummy! The Tonkatsu Ramen is delicious. The broth is very tasty, but the pork can sometimes be too fatty. But everything else in the bowl is deliciousness. The small salad that it comes with is also very delish. I love their salad dressing. Finally, their chicken, egg, and rice bowl, is so good. You'll have plenty of food to eat for the whole day too.",4
Game to little Tokyo looking for some good ramen. Came across this place and the line was packed to get in! Decided to wait to see what everyone was raving about.Got seated in about 30 minutes which wasn't bad and the waiter was amazing! Got us seated and took our order right away. Our food came out in no time! The spicy miso ramen had the perfect chewy noodles with hearty soup and the eggs were perfection with pork that just dissolved at first taste.The Gyoza is the best I've ever had!! Can't describe how delicious it was along with the fried rice and shredded pork bowl. My favorite combo.,5
"This was the first place we ever tried ramen and going to other places after just wasn't the same. There are many other ramen spots in Little Tokyo, but there's a reason Daikokuya is always so packed. And I mean packed! The line starts to form outside before they open, we arrived about 15 minutes after and had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated for a party of 4. The ramen is so full of flavor and the serving is big but not overwhelming- a great amount. It's cash only, they have an ATM inside.",4
Pretty good Japanese Ramen here. There's always a wait so be prepared!,4
"Best ramen in LA? Better than anything NorCal has to offer? Many years ago perhaps. With all the new ramen houses sprouting over California, I don't think Daikokuya holds the top spot anymore. If anything, this place is busier than ever. There is always a line out the door and a wait over 45 minutes is nothing unusual. There is really only one thing to order - their Daikoku ramen. Have it kotteri style unless you are on a crazy diet (in that case you really shouldn't be eating ramen). They have tsukeman and yakisoba but I can't imagine getting those over a staple bowl of tonkotso ramen.The broth was nicely done but didn't impress me like Ippudo in NYC. It was milky, rich and complex. Everything you would expect from a reputable top tier ramen joint (in US). The noodles did not stand out. The chewiness is lacking. Shin-Sen-Gumi's has much better texture even though they were thinner hakata style.The Toppings was average. Chashu was fat enough but no where compares to the buttery ones from Santouka's. The soft boiled egg was good though. Their house made goyza is a must try side dish. I like crisped skin and juicy fillings.Sad to say but I really don't think Daikokuya was worth the long wait. Santouka serves up an overall better bowl and you could save yourself a lot of time.",3
"Oh My-Lanta!This place is yum yum yummy! Completely worth the wait. I visited the Downtown one... Orgasms in my mouth is what!I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen &amp; Fried Rice. The fried rice is ever so addicting! You'd swear it was crack! The egg that came in my ramen! I wish there was 2! The ramen itself, yummy and rather firm making it easier to eat with mah chopsticks.I will be returning to Daikokuya and highly recommending to many ^_^",5
Honestly I just wasn't that impressed. Tsujita annex and tsujita are far better. I enjoyed my meal but it didn't live up to my expectations.,3
"I think this was one of the more decent ramen spots that i have had here in LA. i got the spicy miso which is what i usually get when i go to ramen places and i thought their version was fine, not like other places. Anyway, a lot of people like this so you can go ahead and try it and judge for yourself. I would not fall in line, nor would go out of my way for this though. But i would eat here again if i need to (like if all of my friends were going)I like the other branch better, the one in Sawtelle i think or West LA area.",3
"This place is amazing! We decided on this spot because it was the only place with a wait in Little Tokyo. The other noodle houses sat empty, but this little gem had a 20-30 minute wait. That's normally a good sign. We started with a spicy tuna roll and gyoza. Just as I expected, delicious and left wanting more for the main course. I had the spicy miso soup with additional pork on the side. The broth was piping hot with so much flavor, I'm not sure I could even take it all in after the sake. The noodles were dense and flavorful without being gummy or mushy. They hit this one out of the park. I definitely recommend you check out this little noodle house.",4
"Oh my god this place has the best ramen I have ever eaten. Ever. It's a pretty small little place known for its long wait time, but sometimes you'll get lucky and get in quick. Totally worth the wait though, especially if you appreciate how amazing they are at making their ramen. I come here every time I'm back in LA no matter what because I always leave this place so completely satisfied, even if I had to wait. THE BEST.",5
"Was kind of iffy at first, the place seemed small and randomly placed in the street rather than a plaza. But there is always a line for this place. The wait is like 30 min to and hour. Me and my friends just walked around little tokyo for a while. The waiter took the order after a resonable time after we seated. Food came in like 10 min. we ordered RamenIn my opinion the Ramen was really good. The noodles had the right texture and the flavor is in the soup, but one of my friend didn't enjoy the taste. So experience depends on personal preference. Ramen bowl cost like 10 dollars, worth a try if your walking little tokyo.",4
"This place always has a huge line in front. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The last time we came here with my sister, we were to hungry to wait in the line.This time, we got here before it opened and decided to wait to see if we would make it in the first seating. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Success!We both tried the tsukemen cold ramen noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Seared chasu, hard boiled egg, green onions. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I can see why the long lines for the ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_As good as you can get without going to Japan. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Even the ambiance inside reminds you that you're in Japan having a ramen lunch.The wait staff isn't the friendliest. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So gotta deduct a star!",4
Alice J This food it is great Ramen good.I am fan of Daikokuya Ramen Japan.Wonderful Ramen.,4
"This is easily one of the most popular ramen spots in LA, and the constant wait lines are proof of that. I've been to Daikokuya a number of times, &amp; it never fails to impress. The last time I visited was because I was in Little Tokyo for Shinsengumi's $3 ramen special. The wait for Shinsengumi was over an hour though, so we decided to go around the corner to Daikokuya, still in the mood for some ramen. I always go for the Daikokuya Ramen; sometimes I'll make it a combo &amp; get chicken teriyaki or pork as well. The ramen here is thick, with a creamy soup base. They don't skip out on toppings of pork, geen onion, &amp; egg. The thick &amp; creamy consistency is what separates Daikokuya from other ramen places that are generally a little lighter with the ingredients. This richness will leave you more than satisfied after one bowl. The vibe inside is lively, as it's always packed, &amp; can feel a little cramped. It's decor is homey, mixing traditional Japanese style with American diner booths.Expect to spend around $10-15 for a meal. Depending on when you visit, parking can be hard to find in Little Tokyo. And definitely expect a wait. It's worth it though.",4
"I think I'm going to stop trying to turn into a ramen fan. I've tried several different places and figured this one will be the one to impress me. The wait wasn't as bad as other ramen places where I've seen lines out the door. Maybe it helps to come around 3? Either way, I only had to wait about 20 minutes for a party of 7. The server's seemed pretty busy since this was clearly a popular place in LA to get ramen. The bowl was really simple. Maybe too simple for me (not enough meat/veggies). I agree that the broth was flavorful but I wish I opted for the spicy bowl instead to add in a kick. Probably won't go back b/c ramen isn't for me. This place is cash only.",3
"Waited an hour on a hot Sunday afternoon to try this place because a 4-star Yelp rating of 6,000+ reviewers had convinced me-together with the group of people standing outside which drew me in to believe I could not pass this up while visiting Little Tokyo. But the truth is, there's nothing extraordinary here. The place is actually really small, hence, the long line. We were seated finally in a booth by the entrance. Not cool having hungry people watch you eat while waiting on the sideline for a table for themselves. Service (though friendly) wasn't too great either. We ordered sushi and tempura (aside noodles) which I wouldn't do again, realizing later on that it was my badd for ordering something else from a ramen restaurant. Yes, I agree that the House ramen was delicious, but worth the whole experience? I don't think so. I've tasted ramen that's just as good, if not better, back home in SD. Bottom line: this place is overrated.",3
"First time heading into Daikokuya and absolutely loved the spicy miso ramen. My friend, who is obsessed with the spot, took me, convincing me it would be the best ramen I've ever tried. I've only eaten ramen a few times so I didn't have much to ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_compare my experience with, but I loved it. The spice level was just right. I'm a huge spicy person so I add siracha to kick up the heat. However, I know people can have a sensitive palate when it comes to spice levels, so I thought it was a great balance. My friend knew the wait times picked up around 6:30 so we made sure to arrive by 5:45 and waited barely a couple minutes. Service was sweet and attentive. Cash only and no take out is a little hard but it is definitely working for them! Well done Daikokuya.",4
My sister and I waiting 90 minutes on a Monday afternoon. Totally worth it! We were there to celebrate her getting a visa to work in Japan and this was perfect. The li e is long because this place rocks. Ramen only like $10 and food came in 1 minute. It's just seriously that good and popular.,5
"My girlfriend and I both got the Daikoku Ramen, which was extra dank, due to its Kotteri ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_flavored broth. It also came in half size which was perfect for the girlfriend.OUR kind waitress recommended the fried spicy tuna. everything came out within 5 minutes and were cooked to perfection.Will come again!",5
"Some of the best ramen in LA, the broth is so good. My friend suggested this place we went at prime dinner time and waited for an hour, the inside is small and dingy but the food is worth it. Tip: just try to get there earlyish so you don't starve to death waiting to be seated.",5
"I've only been to a few ramen places, so I consider myself a newb in the ramen world. BUT! After trying the Daikokuya, I have to say that this place had one of the BEST ramen I've had so far. Loved the creamy broth, and it didn't have that weird aftertaste from the pork. And the boiled egg was delicious where its core was semi-cooked and gooey. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was quite busy the evening that I came in, and we had to wait about an hour (give or take). But I think waiting to be seated at this place is unavoidable it seems. And remember to remember the number next to your name when you sign in because they call your party by the number. TIP: CASH ONLY. My friend and I had to run to the nearest ATM machine at a bank after realizing we didn't have any cash on us. They do have an ATM machine inside the restaurant, but we didn't want to get charged a fee.",5
"Me and my husband were craving ramen so I yelped places around the area and found this restaurant, it had great reviews so we decided to give it a try. We didn't wait long and service was ok. We ordered the miso ramen and it was good but nothing extraordinary.",3
"DAIKOKUYA IS MY FAVORITE RAMEN PLACE. But ramen is all about preference, and there are so many places out there. I haven't tried every ramen place in LA, but I've tried enough to know what I prefer! I do love Shinsengumi's customizable broth so much, but Daikokuya never fails to hit the spot for me. I used to come here every single Friday with friends during sophomore year of college, and then head over to Ozero for boba afterwards. I pretty much get the classic ramen every time - sometimes I have the spicy miso ramen if I'm feeling like it. Both are really good. I love their noodles, their pork (oof, melts in my mouth, but I wish they put more than a couple pieces), and the egg. The broth is more on the cleaner side taste-wise--not as deep and rich as some other places, but I personally prefer that. It's just very no-nonsense and consistent. I also HIGHLY recommend their shredded pork bowl! THAT SHIT IS SO BOMB! There's a combo you can get with both ramen and the bowl, so I'd try that if you have a big appetite and want to knock out both at the same time. I've gotten the bowl just on its own multiple times, and it's more than enough for me. It's tender, but also has crispy layers to balance it out. The abundance of green onion also doesn't hurt. I think it'd be perfect with a topping of avocados, but that's just me, and it's not completely necessary. Overall, this place is one of those ""classic"" spots that I can always rely on. I'm always on the lookout for great ramen, but many times I just want a bowl of good ole Daikokuya. It's affordable and straightforward, and if you avoid peak hours, you're likely to go in, get your food quickly, and enjoy good ramen.",5
"Best ramen I've ever had! I make a 2.5 hr drive from Palm Springs just to eat here. Their pineapple fried rice is also amazing. The only thing I hate is that it's cash only, so heads up!",5
"Daikokuya - checked off! Always heard positive talk about this place for years, so I'm very happy to have finally tried it one faithful Friday night. Yes, we waited about an hour, but with great company the time passed by rather quickly. I normally don't eat past 10 pm but my buddies were feeling adventurous and it was all of our first time there, so why not, right? We entered at midnight and left the restaurant at 12:25 am. The ramen was so dang delicious we pretty much inhaled it. I got myself the Daikoku Ramen and added some nanami togarashi, white pepper, and extra garlic paste. I haven't had a great bowl of ramen in a long time, so this definitely hit the spot. I tried my friend's spicy miso broth and it was good too, but we all agreed that the Daikoku was the winner. As a matter of fact, I could certainly go for another bowl of their ramen right now...",5
"This original location blows all other Daikokuyas out of the universe. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I mean, I do not understand how the quality can be so different between the different locations. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Given that, all you need to order is the Daikokuya Ramen with the bean sprouts on the side (gets in the way!). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is packed with flavor yet doesn't coat your mouth with fat like you'd expect from such a rich broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen is cooked perfect and the massive amounts of green onion kind of brings this dish together. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Even though your heart tells you NOT to drink all the broth after you're done with the noodles, there's just no turning back. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You either go big, or go home. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_5 stars for taste.It's not hard to see why this place ALWAYS has a wait time exceeding 45 minutes...IF you're lucky.",5
"Long wait! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tremendous amount of hype!I ate here about three times, and each time I enjoyed the broth and the meat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Miso Ramen or Tonkotsu soup base (Daikokuya Ramen) are both great choices. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I believe they have one of the best Tonkotsu soup bases. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, just something about it with the noodles didn't express the flavor fully. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If I only knew, I could maybe guess that the noodles were cooked a bit different every-time I try it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I felt that I could sip the bowl without eating any noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Strangely enough. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is affordable and definitely in my top pick of ramen spots!",4
It was highly ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_recommended. Had the Daikokuya Ramen soup. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I give it a solid 4 star .Wish it was cleaner as we sat at the bar and stared at a dirty cooking window.,3
"I LOVE this ramen place. Daikokuya needs to branch out to NorCal so I can eat it more often. When I landed in LA, the girlfriend and I immediately headed for Daikokuya. You know you love ramen when it is 100 degrees but you still want a piping hot bowl of noodles soaked in rich, flavorful broth. Luckily for us, there was no wait and we snagged parking across the street. I ordered the kotteri Daikoku Ramen for that extra rich fatty flavor promised to me on the menu. I was overjoyed what a decent sized bowl of ramen emerged, enough to make me full. Sadly now that I am back in NorCal I dream about Daikokuya on cold days (which is almost every single day in San Francisco). Until we meet again Daikokuya.What I recommend:- Daikoku Ramen",4
"DELICIOUS ramen! The food is exceptional and the staff is friendly and as quick as can be. The prices are good but the wait is pretty long, but that's what happens when the restaurant actually has good food. It's a small place and a hole in the wall type of feel but if you're looking for good food in a comfortable little place then this is your spot.",5
"Best Ramen ever! Kotteri flavor is advisable to those that prefer richer broth. They have really good fried rice too. Only negative thing I will say is that they only take cash, which isn't that big of a problem for me, but it would definitely be more convenient if they took card payments too.",5
"The ramen is absolutely delicious. Frankly, I think it's even worth the wait (if you come during the dinner rush, be prepared to wait up to an hour!). Plan accordingly.",5
"Simply incredible! The broth is to die for, get the added back fat. It's cramped and can get hot and people are in a hurry but sit back and take it all in, it's the experience and the ramen is incredible!! Worth the wait, hang out, talk to tourists.",5
"I had the honor to have my first bowl of authentic (not instant) ramen here! I came in with a big appetite and high expectations and came out completely satisfied. The shop is pretty small and is VERY crowded. The waiting goes outside too. Right off the bat, I noticed how famous this place is because of all the elite yelper name tags I saw. There is bar seating as well as booth seating. My group sat in a small booth. I ordered a big bowl of ramen! It's the very best haha. The broth was amazing and the noodles are so good as well. The service is excellent. The staff is friendly and outgoing. I haven't had ramen since, I'm going to have really big expectations for the next one I go to! I loved it.",5
"Great soups, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_good help, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_speedy service, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_too much wait, but worth the wait! Will continue to go there, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_no matter what the wait is...",3
"So this was a seriously interesting place to visit. I went one rainy night when my friends and I were craving ramen and my friend had seen this place had very high ratings on yelp. When you walk in, it's probably the size of a living room in there. Very cramped and just a small walk way. You write your name down and pray that they call it because no one is going to tell you how long the wait is or how many people are ahead of you. Which was fine by me. Probably waited 45 minutes at 9pm? I was like this place better be the best thing that ever happened to me! We finally sit down and I see that dreadful sign that says cash only.... darn I should've read further on yelp! Anyway two things to really remember are CASH ONLY and ALL PORK BASED BROTHS. My friend cannot eat certain meats due to religious reasons so she had to order something different. I'll review all the items :) I went with the combo of the original daikokuya ramen and a side of fried rice since I love fried rice. I believe the price was 11$ for both, which is a steal. My friend who couldn't eat the ramen got a spicy tuna roll. The ramen was delicious, it was strange for me since I've never had it before but it was a good different! I'm a big pho lover so I was just basing it off of that. The broth was very flavorful, good amount of green onions (my favorite), meat and sprouts were generous. Overall, good ramen. My fried rice was a ball of confusion. It tasted good but lord knows what was in it! I think any sort of meat they had got thrown into it because there were some questionable textures in it. But it tasted delicious so I guess whatever? My friend's spicy tuna roll was actually really good. It was very fresh which is strange for a ramen joint but good surprise! When we were done, I got a check and a thank you and that was really it. We paid and just left. Good food but don't expect any sort of real service, but I don't think it's needed for a place like this, they provide everything you could need at your finger tips. Overall, I'd come again.",3
Awesome place for Ramen. Mostly there's a long long line at the door. It opens at 11 am.,5
Oh my god. The best ramen I've ever had. Had both of their tonkotsu and spicy miso and I have nothing to complain about for either of those. Tonkotsu was so creamy and flavorful while the spicy miso was just perfect. Not too spicy and not blend at all. Their noodles were so perfect too. Everything in the ramen was amazing! The wait was around 10-15 mins on a Monday at 11:30ish and their service was pretty quick. Servers were friendly and nice too!,5
"The line was so long. I thought it was going to be in and out. The seating is limited and the owner/management knows about it. They acknowledge and apologize for it in their menu. Hey, if it keeps the ramen this good, I'll take it.Had the Daikoku ramen which as so warm and filling and totally hits the spot and was soooo good on a rainy day. It was seasoned just right (for saltiness). I just had to add a little white pepper to clear the sinuses, you know?The infamous garlic sauce was good; not as spicy as I expected it to be. I thought it was pure ground/blended fresh garlic, but I think not. Hmmm...Cash Only people.Love the pop art on display!",4
"This is THE togoto place for that heavily dosed ramen soup. The richness in their broth along side their beer is a match made in heaven ;) ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ I would definitely come back here, good food, good staff, good price.",4
The hour wait sucked for a party of 2 at 11pm.Also costumer service here sucked I understand perfectly its the ending shift. The ramen over all was just OK for me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't worth an hour wait,3
"Okay ramen place, we have better in Torrance/gardena. The wait was over an hour so we expected better. The service was just okay given that only two waitresses. The worst part of my experience ""cash only"". ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Who is cash only these days? Either they don't wanna pay the fees or hmmm? Lol",3
"So...I'm a Japanese Ramen fanatic. I live and die for Ramen. That being said, Daikokuya is ok. Is no different than other popular places like Ajisen, Foo Foo, Kopan, and etc..I just wouldn't wait in line to eat at this place...because line outside can get ridiculously long..Another thing is..when is most of these ramen places going to learn spicy ramen actually needs to be spicy? I asked for the spiciest they can make it..and ya no..it wasn't even mild at best..What's the point of ordering spicy ramen, if I end up having to ask for a spicy sauce and they ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_bring me a sriracha? w u t ? Don't you dare bring out a sriracha when I'm eating my japanese ramen..I can make a srirach taste ramen at home in 2 minutes ok?",3
"I like ramen. That being said, I've had some pretty deliriously good ramen....but not here. The ramen is great, but not the best, hence the 4 stars. I know. Im being picky. Service and food are great!Bring 4 people total for convenience and parking issues. There were 5 of us, one came late, almost lost us a spot, and the table was a squeeze. Be prepared to make small talk or delve into each others souls for an hour before getting in. I got the daikoku ramen, which is a pork based soup broth, so veggies don't be fooled thinking you can just pick out pork strips and be done with it. It has a nice smooth rich flavor that goes awesome with the half boiled egg. I love me my eggs. And the noodles are good, not the store crap. I also got an order of bamboo which is just a personal thing, but it adds another layer of texture. I think the spicy is pretty good too, if you can keep eating the whole bowl without losing the joy of eating haha I took it easy. Nice spot for some fun chill times with buddies just getting out if work.",4
"Such a long wait sometimes, but sooo worth it! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've been here multiple times and I've gotten the Daikokuya ramen, Spicy ramen, and the shredded pork bowl (that comes with the ramen in a combo meal). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I love the texture of the noodles here and the soup is so tasty! Service is always fast and there's definitely a reason behind the four stars. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's seriously the best ramen I've ever had and every time I'm in LA I make it an obligatory stop to get my ramen fix!",5
"I have NEVER had better! There was a line we waited and it was Soooo worth it. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. We got lucky and got the last booth available. The service was amazing and I love the kitschy dÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©cor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_my son got the Daikoku Ramen, which includes pork, egg, and toppings. LOTS of green onions he LOVED the broth. I got the meat fried Rice there was a TON of food.Parking we got lucky and there was a meter out front but we got there about 1 hour before they opened so it was an easy snag. I had never been there before we were just driving around Downtown and I happened to turn and see this line I was like "" What's this?"" I said what the hell let's jump out and stand in line and I'm so happy we did. now my FAVORITE noodle house in the area. Going back this weekend :)",5
"Quite good, but a little bit salty as the other ramen. I don't want to wait in the long line in this cold weather, so I went there on 3:30pm, but I still had to wait.",4
"Amazing food; Worst wait ever.Was here on a Sunday afternoon (about 2:30pm) and was listed after six parties. The restaurant was really small so I see why wait here is ridiculously long on lunch/dinner rush hours (Only a bar and six booths). We came in and listed our name on the paper. I thought that since it's in the afternoon, and only six parties ahead of us, the wait would be bearable. However, they are ridiculously understaffed and very unorganized in seating people. I mean, you guys are making so much money from so many customers, cant you hire more people???Parties of two were always seated immediately so people, including me and my party, started getting frustrated after having to wait for over 45 minutes while other people get seated immediately. The person in charge of seating people kept leaving so people were getting confused. We asked what was happening and the guy told us that we were suppose to circle our names if we are waiting... I mean WHAT?We waited for an additional of 30 minutes, with people kept coming up to the guy who always leaves and then comes back after 10 minutes, even when there were available booths. We finally got seated and got our food served almost immediately after ordering. The shredded pork bowl was UHH-mazing and the ramen was so delicious.I'd recommend coming here at least once in your life but with the ridiculous experience I've had on a non-busy hour, I can only imagine the kind of hell you would have to go through when you'd have to wait hours on end just to eat on a busy hour.",4
I've tried this spot a couple times and have ordered the spicy miso ramen and the tonkotsu ramen as well. The spicy miso tasted better to me than the tonkotsu ramen which is what they are known more for. To be completely honest I've had way better tonkotsu ramen and I was a bit surprised to see so many people talk so highly of the ramen here before I tried it. My second visit I decided to turn my ramen into a combo and ordered a side of the chicken and egg over rice and a side salad. Majority of the chicken was fat and skin and really didn't have much flavor. I must say that the cabbage salad was delicious with their amazing signature dressing. The waitresses were nice and attentive so we appreciated that. I didn't like the fact that it's cash only though...it's 2016! Parking is also annoying unless you get lucky. I may come back for the spicy miso and the house salad.,3
I guess I'll add another review to the 6000+ already. Is it good? YesIs it worth the wait? Probably not and we had only a 45 minute wait in the middle of the day on a Saturday Would I come back? Yes if the wait wasn't so longWas it greatest ramen ever or at least in Los Angeles? I don't know and will never know cause I don't even live there,4
I came here with my girlfriend with high expectations. Line was long. We waited about 20 mins. Food is only ok.,3
"Ok. We had waited for a little less than 2 hours and finally got a seat. They don't have many choice of ramen, there was just one. So ordering was easy. First, the noodle was out of package. Also the tuna inside of frying batter was canned tuna. I was expecting spicy fresh tuna filling. Tempura was disappointing, pretty much all Japanese places know how to make very light glass like crispy batter, but not here. I still like the unique fragrance of tuna tempura and asian sweet potato tempura. If ramen was WOW good, then I wouldn't mind coming back regardless of long wait, and so so side dishes, but it is not 5 star ramen and I am sure I can find the same quality and flavor at other ramen shops in LA. The soup base was very rich yet not too greasy unlike many other famous ramen places I have been to. Also, melt in ur mouth pork was very tasty, and not stinky. I think noodle takes 50% of ramen quality, but the noodle here is not impressive AT ALL. Maybe I am too spoiled since I have tasted best ramen in Japan, but I hope this place can come up with their own specialty ramen noodle.",4
"This place is completely overrated. While the ramen was okay, it is def not worth the wait. The fried rice is actually better than the ramen. The place has NO AC which is absolutely ridiculous. I'm the kind of person who doesn't sweat easily but I was sweating while eating which was very uncomfortable. The physical environment is just really unpleasant. CASH ONLY.",3
"ITS RAMEN WEEK IN LA!! yayyyyy!!we came here last thursday night and it was packed, we waited for about 45 minutes for seats at the bar, Chris was our waiter and he was delightful. Loved his energy and his positive attitude, took our orders right away and was a joy to be around. :DI forget the name of the ramen i got.. But it was the first choice of ramen when you get the combo... The ramen was yummy... very delicious, the rice bowl i got with steak was ok. The steak was a bit rough for my taste but flavorful. I really liked the decor here. its dark and packed with people! Nice place to come with friends but maybe not a place to do any leisurely eating as you would probably feel guilty looking at the all the people waiting in line for your spot... I felt a bit rushed. would come back even if it wasnt ramen week. :D",3
"Daikokuya is a little hole in the wall on 1st avenue right across the street from the Japanese village in Little Tokyo. We had no idea there was going to be an hour an a half wait but because this place had amazing revues, we were totally willing to take the 30th spot on what looked like a never ending list of names. The restaurant was smaller than we expected but felt super cozy. I was really impressed that they were able to get people in, fed, satisfied, paid up and out the door in such a small amount of time. There are only three ramens to choose from. The signature Daikokuya ramen, the spicy miso ramen and the cold Tsukemen ramen. All of us ordered the combo that included their signature Daikokuya Ramen, the critically acclaimed shredded pork rice bowl and the Japanese coleslaw. The portions are really big. They also have an assortment of appetizers and of course there are things like fried rice, tempura and sushi but we were on a ramen mission.The noodles tasted so fresh and were really soft and fluffy. The hard-boiled egg added a nice touch and the broth was super meaty. There was so much depth and richness. Our host showed us what to add so in went the spoonfuls of the minced garlic paste and chili oil, which took it up a notch.The shredded pork over rice was hands down a favorite of the entire table. The rice was cooked perfectly. The pork belly was juicy and marinaded in a sweet sauce topped with a heavy portion of fresh green onions and brightly colored pink pickled ginger. All the flavors combined covered all 5 basic food senses.Daikokuya was a great find. If the wait seems ridiculous then get your name on the list and head over to the Japanese Village to kill some time. There's boba's, beautiful macaroons, karaoke, mochi shops and lots of Hello Kitty. So much to love about Little Tokyo.",4
"Best ramen in LA. Hands down. Don't go there if you have a shellfish allergy tho, all their broth has some fish oil with shrimpIn it. Add a little sirracha, chili oil, and that red stuff on the table and you're set!",5
4 years and the D-R-E says ain't a damn thing changed.@collegekids Shake fist!! This place... I never go here due to lines. My technique not to get annoyed at this nonsense: just get here not too hungry and put your name on the list. Head over to Far Bar sip yo drank for ~40 minutes and then check back.But you'll wonder why bother? Couples wind up on stools at a crowded counter. And the ramen is just meh. I'd rather just make my Sun Noodle ramen at home. The things single guys have to endure for the loving.,2
"All I can say to this place is, them ramens are good!!! The only friggin downside is where you can park and the line. We arrived here, I think around 5-6pm and the line almost stretch thru out the globe!!! But no, it didnt intimidate us on our mission to eat ramen, as we were really hungry. After half an hour or so, we finally made it and they greeted us as we walked in, as if we won a race or some'n? The menu options are clear and I did get a special ramen and takoyaki.The taste of the food is good! the atmosphere is like in Japan! Overall, my heart melts and tastebuds are satisfied! 5/7 I'll visit again soon!",4
"The best ramen I have ever had. You may arrive and think to yourself, ""the ramen can't possibly be worth waiting forever for; it's probably just as good next door."" I assure you it is not and you will be greatly disappointed in yourself for ever doubting Daikokuya. Akiko was our server and she helped with our selections and was so attentive even though it was a packes house. Don't settle for less...you deserve Daikokuya in your life!",5
"Maybe I hyped it up too much before I got there since this place has such great reviews. Or maybe the batch I got was eh?Idk. I was expecting the broth to be rich, deep, and full of flavor; but instead, I waited over an hour for some eh ramen. It tasted flat instead of round, if that makes sense. The flavor wasn't all it could've been. I ordered their special, kotteri style. I've had more flavorful broths elsewhere. I had high hopes. So sad :((Egg was soft boiled and yummy. Chashu was average. 2 stars for the garlic on deck though. That's probably the only reason why I finished the whole bowl.",2
"Quick facts:Cash only with atm insideSign ur name on a list before standing in lineThere will be a line so don't come when you are already hungryYou get seated faster if it's only two or less peopleNot stroller/high chair friendly Pros:The combo is such a great deal. For about $15 you get to try their ramen and a smaller version of their rice bowls. There is no way you will leave hungry. The pork don is really good and the flavors are spot on. Food comes out pretty quick. I love the decor and the feel of this restaurant- it's exactly how a ramen shop in Japan would be. Cons:For the long wait and all the hype on yelp, we were expecting some really good ramen, maybe even as good as ones we had in Japan . But the broth was very bland and that was a huge disappointment. our noodles were under cooked and sticking together in a clump. The egg and the pork were perfect. I dont think it's delicious enough to justify the ridiculous wait. We came on a Sunday morning ten minutes before they opened and we didn't get seated until one hour later. The larger groups in front of us were still waiting. Also the back of the kitchen/bathroom area was kind of dirty (flies flying around, dirty floors).",3
"Every time I drive by this place and the one on Sawtelle there always seems to be a line outside their doors. I finally tried it tonight and regretted it. I've been to several ramen places that had vegetarian broth options or at least dry ramen, but this place doesn't have either. Yeah, their menu has a few options that have a ""leaf"" next to the menu item to show it can be made vegetarian, but their ramen broth is all pork based. So I chose an entree with a ""leaf"" called Yakisoba. So basically the vegetarian option is just noodles, carrots and cabbage. All they do is take the pork out, so I asked if I can add protein like tofu or an egg. She first didn't know what I meant by protein and after explaining it she said no. She pointed to their Cold Ramen entree which can be made vegetarian and in the picture it showed an egg. One half of an egg to be exact. First of all, cold ramen?! Weird. I didn't seem to have any other choice at this point so that's what I ordered. I'm sorry but it just wasn't good. I ate my one half of an egg and some of the other stuff wishing I enjoyed it. The service was not terribly horrible but just okay. I suppose. We felt always rushed the moment we sat down. We were rushed to order, rushed to finish eating since they kept asking if we were done and rushed to pay. I'm sure the pork loving ramen lovers enjoy this place, but unfortunately, I won't be coming back and neither will my friends.",1
"SorryI know everybody is expecting me to fall in line with a 4+ review, but I just cannot.Parked in the lot across the street, sign said $5, but was charged $8. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Put my name on the list and was told approximately 40 minutes. Walked the little Tokyo mall area, had some boba at a little market place and then went back and waited. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It appeared that I would be soon. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_She called Brian, number 30. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Figured I had better look, cause I didn't know my number. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Anyway, she was crossing my name out, when I explained that my name is Daryl, not Brian and my number was 13, not 30. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Got seated, after waiting one hour - there were 21 groups ahead of us. I ordered the spicy miso ramen and the girls ordered the regular. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Food arrived in about 5 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I smelled mine, and it smelled wrong. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Like something was fermenting or maybe rotten. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Because I can't trust my nose, I forged on. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles tasted normal, but the broth not so much. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Asked the girls, and they were feeling the same. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Left without finishing. Stomach not feeling so good now. Eating some bread with some Sprite. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ If this was my first Ramen experience, I would never go to any others.",2
"I've lived in Los Angeles through high school and I am embarrassed to say that my first time here was during a visit from Berkeley as an almost graduating senior from college. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It had taken me that long even after hearing rave reviews and with my deep inherent love for all things that are noodles. We arrive around 8:30 pm (though it was a Saturday) thinking that it was a safe time to dine and that the restaurant would be clearing up. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My friend said that there isn't very much seating because the place is relatively small. WOW. It was fully packed with a wait-list that numbered into the hundreds. We had had a full day of hiking and longing for some hot ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Throwing out any judgment we had, we decided to wait it out. People couldn't have as much patience and passion for ramen as we did right? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Apparently yes. Little did we know it would be two hour wait. FINALLY, as the weak were weeded away, our number was called and we were seated at a booth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We had already perused the menu in those two hours of waiting and knew what we wanted. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All of us got some order that involved the classic Daikoku Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Someone had ordered the combo that included shredded pork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When the food arrived we dove in. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't know if it was just the delayed satisfaction, the build up of excitement from waiting and the absolute piercing hunger that was consuming our stomachs but it was the most heavenly bowl of ramen I've had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It had a great meaty flavor with noodles that weren't too hard or too soft, but the perfect texture. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork was tender and the eggs were also flavored in sauce with a delicately soft yolk. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The shredded pork was also perfectly seasoned and marinated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would highly recommend getting a combo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_At the end of the meal we were drinking out bowls dry even though the portion was pretty hefty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_What is nice is that it does stay open until midnight, however because of the wait, I would say it has to in order to accommodate those to arrive at a decent hour for dinner. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We had waited over two hours for a meal that would last fifteen minutes. That says something about the quality of food, but not about the experience. If I had the chance and the restaurant was not crowded (not likely), I would definitely come back. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Perhaps the Little Tokyo Daikokuya is more popular than the other locations or maybe smaller. Ambiance: 3.5 (it was cramped)Food: 5/5Service: 4/5 (Food came out relatively fast as it should)Overall Experience: 3.5/5 (The food was amazing, the wait was not)",4
4.5 Stars minus .5 star for cleanliness. Food is great! Price is fair. Service is good.,5
"I finally found one of the best ramen places in Los Angeles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It took me a couple of years, but I finally found it.Daikokuya is a small hole in the wall restaurant that you can easily miss if you were not looking for it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, the obvious line of customers waiting outside is a good giveaway. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Since I brought up the line, you will have to wait unless you arrive early or when they open. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I waited at least 45 minutes to get seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Normally, I do not like waiting and would have suggested eating at another place in Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, Daikokuya had extremely good reviews that I had to find out for myself what made it so good.Finally entering the little restaurant, my friend and I were seated at the bar. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Sitting at the bar is another thing that do not enjoy, but for the sake of trying Daikokuya, I'm taking one for the team. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The service is fast. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ordered, we ate, and we left. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_With a large waiting audience outside that continues to grow by the minute, they ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_need to be fast.We ordered gyoza and tsukemono as our appetizers and both order the grilled pork ramen (their staple). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The gyoza is delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is deep fried so that when it is served, it looks like a pile of brown dumplings stuck together. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It didn't look that appealing at first, but after eating it is pure heaven.As for the ramen, I found it to be okay. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was good and the grilled pork was a good combination to the vegetables inside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, it was the noodles that made it sooooooooooooooo delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I haven't had noodles that tasted this good in a long time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_LONG TIME! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It reminded me of Hamura Saimin noodles on Kauai, Hawaii. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you are from Hawaii, you know what I am talking about. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I am definitely going to come back since they have tonkatsu on their menu. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And I am a tonkatsu snob.",5
"my gold standard for judging ramen. None has come close to comparing. For every flaw it has, I still come back. It's cash only, the place is small and cramped, sometimes you're expected to wait for 1+ hour to be seated, but nothing quite hits the spot the same way.I always get the Daikokuya ramen with a side of fried rice or shredded pork. My friend gets extra pork fat, it's a bit too much for me. It's a decent size, so come hungry or split with a friend.",5
Mother of all ramen!!!!!! love this place super delicious and worth the line even though it is not that long,5
"Came here around 11pm and we still had to wait, although the wait wasn't that long compared to peak hours. Sat at the bar area. Place looked run down and old and bathrooms could have been better.Ordered the combo- daikokuya ramen with fried rice and chicken teriyaki. Came with a side salad with their homemade dressing. The broth for the ramen was pretty good and the fried rice even better. Service was a little subpar for a Japanese restaurant, although still way better than the average Asian place.",3
"Easily one of the best ramen joints on this side of the pond.Their main event is the Daikokuya ramen. The broth is so thick and savory, it's easy to confuse each sip of broth with a delicious bite of meat. Other dishes are delicious as well - I was able to try their sashimi and takoyaki - all incredibly fresh and authentic. I heard the waits can get atrocious, but if you can arrive within 5-10 mins of their lunch opening, you can be seated right away (I got there at 11:10 and did not have to wait at all). I would also recommend the iced oolong tea - I found it very refreshing. The iced green tea, on the other hand, was terrible - gritty and oxidized.",5
"Best Ramen! Best gyoza! Best shashu pork! I like the spicy miso ramen with the shredded pork bowl combo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's way too much food but so amazing! We always get here before they open and the line gets too long. Always expect a line. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service is awesome and super fast. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Love, love, love daikokuya!!",5
"I have come here a total of 3 times, but sadly it does not live up to its name.- Parking: pay to park in the garage directly across from the restaurant or find metered street parking. - CASH only! They have an ATM inside the restaurant by the restroom, but the machine charges $1.50 +whatever charges your bank may have. Food I've ordered from favorite to least favorite: 1. Salmon sashimi: straight up fresh and melts like butter. The cuts are pretty fat &amp; plenty. For 6 slices of sashimi, it's only $9.95. For this type of top notch fresh quality sashimi, it's a great deal.2. Tuna sashimi: thick, fresh pieces of tuna... So good :) also $9.953. Daikoku ramen kotteri style (special): juicy cuts of pork, noodle chewiness consistency perfected (doesn't turn soft and soggy), and I usually get it kotteri style, which means the soup has a fattier pork base. The one main thing that disappointed me was actually the soup base- doesn't taste particularly flavorful, a bit on the bland side.. I personally prefer Santoukou's ramen soup- way better. 4. Pork cutlet bowl (came as a part of the combo with daikoku ramen): includes egg and delicious pork. Taste is really good but I feel like they could've put less rice and more pork. 5. Beef shredded bowl (also comes as an option for the combo): not as good as the other dishes, just an average beef bowl. 6. Sausage: nothing special, would not order again. Overall, the best dishes were definitely the salmon and tuna sashimi, which worries me since this is a known ramen restaurant. I would probably go elsewhere for good ramen.",3
"Interestingly enough, I've fallen more and more in love with the ramen here over the years. I still hate driving to the area and even more so the parking is still horrendous, but it's hands down my favorite ramen (not counting tsukemen) joint in the Los Angeles area!Yes, it's a bold statement. I still don't prefer the eggier noodles here. In fact, my hypothetical perfect bowl of hot ramen would have the noddles from Shinsengumi... But nothing beats the perfect tonkotsu broth you get with the Daikoku ramen. And last time I came here I ordered the kotteri ramen. It's fattier than ever, and thus flavorful without being too salty. That's another thing... I love how this place can get a ton of flavor packed into a bowl of ramen without making it salty.And I know it's irrelevant in a ramen discussion, but I really like the takoyaki here as well.Honestly, I've been wanting to try the udon shop right next door, but I just haven't had the opportunity... Whenever we drive out here, we end up just waiting in line for Daikokuya instead!",5
"First, the wait was long and people were herded all out on the side walk, the server calling out the numbers off the list was so quiet you really have to be on the look out to make sure you don't get skipped. Once seated, the food gets to you relatively fast after you order so that makes up for the wait. I got the daikokuya ramen with kotteri. The broth was clean and good, but kind of bland. I tried asking for chili paste or powder, but all they had was chili oil. So I poured the entire bottle of chili oil in there to give it flavor. It was good after that, but I've definitely had better ramen. Tajima Restaurant in San Diego is the best so far, kitakata ramen in the OC is great too. Overall, the ramen was good, but I wouldn't wait in line for that again.",3
"The ramen and shredded pork bowl combo! And the shredded pork bowl is one of the best things I've ever had! The pork melted in mouth and it was absolutely delicious! The ramen is delicious and that's what they're popular for. The ramen bowls are so huge you can probably share it with someone! One thing I hate about this place is how small and crowded it is. I think they have other locations (that I haven't been to) but maybe those places are bigger and less crowded, so I would try going to before going here. And since this place is pretty popular, it is garunteed to have a wait.",5
"However long it takes to get in, just wait. I was a party of one and it took me about 10 minutes to get in but I saw parties of three and four get in under 15 to 20 minutes and the list is pretty long so don't be afraid when you put your name down. The staff is friendly and courteous and the food comes out lightning fast. I had the Gayoza and they were cooked to perfection, nice and crispy and absolutely delicious. I followed that up with the spicy Ramen soup and the broth is to die for, it's a little on the mild side but they have all the chili powders if you want to give it an extra kick. You even get a nice chilled mug with your Sapporo beer!",5
"Haters gon' hate. Don't care what anyone says. I freaking love this place. Yes, there's always a HUGE line outside. But when it comes to the food, I don't care about any of that. The Daikoku ramen with Kotteri is arguably my favorite bowl of ramen, ever. I'm a huge fan of tonkotsu, and I've had my share of LA/OC ramen. The only spot I've had so far that even puts up a good fight is Silverlake Ramen. My usual is the Daikoku ramen with Kotteri, combo with pork cutlet bowl and the miso cabbage. The broth with Kotteri is to die for. The extra pork fat adds the perfect amount of creaminess and hardiness without making the broth overwhelming. The noodles here are just perfect -- not too firm to where it's chewy, and not too soft to where it mushes. The cuts of pork always have the right ratio of meat to fat. The pork cutlet bowl with the egg is the perfect side to the ramen, and really helps to refresh your pallet away from the heat of the ramen. The service is very good as well. They're always so busy and you can tell they can be stressed out sometimes, but they are very accommodating. Even with a packed house, I never had a hard time of getting a waiter's attention. Objectively, the ramen here at Daikokuya is much better than that of Ippudo. Ippudo actually wouldn't even make my top 5. Sorry! Seriously, I love it. 5 stars",5
"The hype is real! The broth in the ramen has some real powerful flavor in it but isn't too heavy on the salt. I hate when ramen places load their broth with salt for ""flavor."" ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is definitely one of my faves for ramen now.Unfortunately I was too full from our first dinner and my boyfriend and I came with some friends for a late night snack, so I just shared with my boyfriend. We came here at 10pm at night and didn't get seated until 11pm. I really wish I had gotten hungry again so I could enjoy a large ramen bowl. They only have two flavors: the pork and spicy pork. I liked the original better than my friend's spicy broth bc I thought it detracted from the clean and creamy flavored broth. The bowl of ramen is simple: chewy noodles and just some chives for garnish and flavor but it truly is delicious and worth the wait.The servers are quirky and delightful. A friend texted us to bring him an order of ramen to go and we got one of the waiters to pose with a mean mug by the sign that said ""no take out."" Totally made our night.",5
"Yup, totally lives up to the hype, also CASH ONLY.When I first moved to LA, one of my friends from home told me to try this place and their description was ""It's like the Mecca of ramen."" And it really was. I came on a weekend and it was packed. People were waiting outside and inside. My party of 3 had to wait about 1.5 hrs. It's a small restaurant, but it packs a big punch. There's a parking structure right across from it if you don't want to street park.",5
"Today was my first time here (hubby and I were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary). We went here based on a recommendation from my brother and also Yelp reviews. 1)To start my review i must say the service was superb and we were seated right away. We did not have to wait hours (and this is on a Friday night).The servers and host were very nice. 2) The portions of food are huge. For an appetizer we had the Gyoza which was great and I recommend it. As far as the Ramen not so much. We both had their Restaurant named soup and it stunk. It's noodles (obviously), pork, egg, and the toppings. The noodles were OK. The pork was EXTREMELY slimy. The boiled egg thing was EXTREMELY slimy as well (tasted almost rotten). I couldn't eat the rest of my anniversary dinner after that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Needless to say I was very upset and bummed out. I walked out of there feeling very sick. However, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_hubby said his was delicious and nothing was runny or slimy in his bowl. Not sure how that works out, the huge difference between his food and mine. $40.56 later at least 1 of us ended up happy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So pretty much eat there at your own risk...",2
"I enjoyed the food here although the service was slow and the girl seemed as if she didn't want to be there, great ramen though.",3
"A fact about me: I'm not a huge ramen fan. In fact, this is my first ramen review. (shhh shhh shh)I took Fia R.'s incredibly genius advice and came at 11 - opening time. There was already a crowd of people, but I thankfully didn't experience a wait ;)One thing about Daikokuya is that I can't deny that their ramen broth is flavorful (with or without the added kotteri style). Kotteri style is a soup base of pork back fat. I requested the Daikoku Ramen, Kotteri style initially, then inspected that my soup bowl didn't have excessive oil or visibly floating fat, so I asked the waitress, ""excuse me, where the hell is zee FAT?"" ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_She brought out a side of back fat, where I squeamishly poured in half of into my bowl. yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_Oh how visual effects are important to every experience. The texture of the noodles were right, not too soft but not too tough; a perfect al dente. I also liked how the hard boiled egg wasn't thoroughly cooked, but the yolk still held solid. I definitely recommend to opt for the combos, where you can other try non-ramen dishes. I shared the salmon roe bowl which was very simple and delicious (salmon roe, warm rice, nori flakes) and I also liked their cabbage salad. Although Daikokuya makes a solid ramen, I wouldn't recommend anyone to wait long lines for this. I was hoping this place would be a quick hello-ramenfix-goodbye experience, but this was definitely long and slow. Am I a huge fan of ramen yet? Almost there, but not quite.",3
"I thought the ramen was just okay- it wasn't bad but it also wasn't amazing. We arrived here about 15-20 minutes before opening and were able to get seating right when they opened. The ramen portions are huge, enough for two to share a bowl. I don't think it would have been worth it if I was stuck in a huge line though. I've had better ramen though. The place was really small and crowded and the service was just okay.",3
"One of the best ramen place in downtown. I only go here because tsujita is so far away and shinsenkumi is kinda meh. The salad dressing is to die for so no matter what you order, make sure to get the salad as a side. I like it so much I even order a bottle of it to-go!",5
"Sweet Baby Jesus. Come here to fall in love with that chashu. I don't know what they do, how they do it, I wouldn't be surprised if it required the selling of a soul or ten because honestly it was so tender and so flavorful that I would be more than content to sit and eat a whole bucketful of the pork. Amazing. The noodles are also great and have a good bouncy yet firm quality to them. Great for slurping up with a delectable broth. I had the spicy miso broth which was really full bodied and savory. It was definitely rich, but in the best sense. Can't wait to make my next trip to Little Tokyo! I'll definitely be back. Also, don't be discouraged by the long line. It's a sign that there's something really good inside!",5
"A ramen shop that has a 4 star rating and about 5800+ reviews!? This place must be good. That was the one of the reasons I chose to wait out the crowd and give this place a try. Probably the only thing about this place that needs a little work is the fact that it is a cash only establishment... Its 2015, they should be able to accept cards by now seeing it as they already have the technology to take orders on a tablet type of device. Aside from that, the wait time is the only other thing but what can you do if its that popular. You would obviously need to wait to try something that everyone loves. I only waited for about an hour before we were seated. Although the wait was quite long, once we got seated it took no longer than 15 minutes to order and receive your food. I ordered the infamous Daikoku Ramen and it was just better than I expected. Their famous tonkotsu soup base is infused with a secret blend of soy sauce. The dish itself has perfectly boiled chijire style egg noodles (firmness can be changed upon request). Also came with kurobuta pork belly chasu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions and some sesame seeds. The bowl is pretty big but there is half sizes for those who aren't as hungry. I ordered the kotteri version which is a richer soup that is extracted from the back fat. All of that for $9.50!? What a steal! The bottom line is that this place is a must. Simple menu, large portions, and a reasonable price. Whats not to love? oh yeah, the wait time..... Enjoy!",5
"*Cash Only* This Japanese Ramen Cuisine is located in Little Tokyo/Japan Town in Los Angeles. The wait seems to always be ridiculous here, but for my friends and I, it was worth the hour wait. I kept it simple and ordered the Daikokuya Ramen Combo, which I chose Pork Cutlets w/ Rice that also came with a bowl of salad. Plentiful amount of food for the price. The BEST ramen I've tasted in my life. Sounds exaggerated but it's the honest truth. The broth was perfect. Not too salty like many other places I've tried. It was so flavorful. Our waiter was amazeballs. He was very attentive and had a great personality. Highly recommend this place for anyone on vacation or even locals (not that they don't already know about it). :)",5
"Went on off-hours hoping that there wouldn't be a line. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_No such luck. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We hungrily waited outside about forty minutes or so, growing slightly more impatient with every opening of the main entrance which wafted the aroma of the tonkatsu broth out onto the sidewalk while satisfied patrons exited discussing how much they enjoyed their meal.Needless to say, when our number was called we sat down at the counter eager to order before sitting down and scooting our stools in. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered a combination consisting of a bowl of the Daikoku ramen and a small tuna sashimi bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles were great, the broth was flavorful and rich with a light milky/creamy texture, the pork slices were very tender (wish I ordered extra) and the soft boiled egg was good though a tad bit overcooked. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The only problem I had with this bowl of ramen was the amount of green onions and bean sprouts they put in it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's almost overwhelming. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The strong flavor of the mound of freshly cut green onion takes away from the flavor of the broth and the texture of the handful of uncooked bean sprouts gets in the way of enjoying the noodles.Friendly service and appreciative business overall. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think everyone that worked there thanked us pretty much in unison as we left.",4
"If you can bear the wait or have someone get there early....this is one of the best places in Downtown Los Angeles, heart of Little Tokyo, to get Ramen. I'm not sure what it is but the broth is super rich and creamy, the egg they have in the ramen are always cooked to perfection and they have a perfect combo set which I always love to get and switch around.Upon entering, you put your name on a little clip board at the front entrance. Luckily my gf was there to put our names down when she went to do happy hour with coworkers. The interior has lot of old school Japanese culture,.They have red booths and handful of counter top seats. Think of a 50's diner with a splash of Japanese culture. I do not recommend coming here for parties of 6 or more or you'll be waiting for about at least an hour. Service is attentive and accommodating as they check on you asking you if you want more water and how the food is.**note that this place is cash only!!!!***",5
"There's usually a ~30 min wait but it's well worth it! Get their specialty (and the reason they're in business) - the daikoku ramen! It's $8.95 for a generous portion. You can also get a half size or large.The broth is flavorful and the noodles are slightly firmer than your average ramen. They also include a whole hard boiled egg in the broth. Every time I'm in Little Tokyo, I always go here. I've never been to their other locations but it may be worth it to try.",5
We waited for a little over an hour in the cold night air outside---but it was totally worth it. My boyfriend and I both got the default bowl of ramen and an amazingly fresh gyoza app. That was seriously the BEST gyoza I have ever had.Anyways the pork bone broth was savory and just right. I totally loved it. Will be back! Daikokuya has my heart :),5
"Worth the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you're a broth believer and you think that's what makes a ramen, then this is it for you.If you're a noodle nerd who thinks that's what makes a ramen, then this is it for you.If you're an impatient ass, then go someplace else.",5
7 days later I am still in extreme pain from the severe burn to my mouth. My gums have shriveled up in the spot it was burnt the worst. Awful beware poor serving and health awareness at this restaurant!!!!,1
"Took my younger sister out to have ramen for the first time and we fell in love with this place. Found it online and was recommended by some of my friends. Despite the 25 min wait, it was worth it. The food was amazing (a bit salty for my liking but still good) including the sushi which was fresh. The only downside I had was that they only take cash which made it a hassle for me. Other than that i will visiting again.",4
Gotta up it to 5 stars just because I ate ramen earlier that same night at Santouka and I still wanted to come here.It's that good just as long as you get the combination with either the small fried rice or the shredded pork bowl.Ramen twice in one night.Yeah I'm fat like that.Read my original review for how I really feel about the place.,5
"A little bit disappointed... The soup is not thick enough.Quantity wise, it's pretty filling.",3
"Good portion good flavour. Time to time ramen restaurant soup bases are watered down, but this place is on the spot, noodle was good thickness egg is cooked to perfection",4
"over hyped or what?! i came here because my friend was raving about this place, saying that it was the best ramen place in the entire US of A and i was utterly disappointed! BUT, the service was friendly and prompt.i ordered the daikokuya ramen, no bean sprouts. here's what i thought of the ingredients:bland, is the best way i can put the broth. It's a pork flavor broth, but it tasted watered down and i had to add a shit load of chilly peppers and that garlic mush before i could even semi-enjoy it.the noddles however, we're the right consistency. Perfectly cooked, not too soggy, not to tough. the meat was also pretty flavorful, but there wasn't enough! two measly pieces did little for my stomach.the egg, wasn't anything special, it was an egg. the end.and then the massive amount of green onion that seemed to fill the entire bowl, what are you trying to hide, daikokuya?! we also ordered the gyoza, pretty sure my sodium intake sky rocketed after one piece.anyway, i've heard from people that this place is better than ramen dojo. i have taste buds, and this place doesn't even compare.",3
Came here super late at night with family. They let us put our names on the list even though it was 30 minutes to close. Even late at night they still had a wait. Got a couple seats at the bar and were promptly served. Food was very filling!! If you are hoping to get a vegan broth this is not the place for you...,4
"My friend told me about Daikokuya and we stumbled here after realizing there was nothing else to do. I ordered the daikokuya ramen and she ordered the spicy miso ramen. The shop is super small, so despite it being 2:30pm in the afternoon, there was a wait. We sat at the bar and only waited a little bit until our food came. The pork was so tender, it literally melted in my mouth. The noodles were great, not overdone, not underdone, just the perfect bite. The broth...don't even get me started on how balanced it was, it was salty, creamy, smooth. So good. The green onions added a nice pop of color and crunch. Oh! And the egg, the eggs in ramen are always my favorite, my only qualm is that this wasn't cut in half. All in all, this was awesome.",4
"Their ramen is good but we waited for 40 mins to be seated. In the end, it was worth it but I prefer to go in a cooler day. I went on a hot summer day (106 degrees) to hot for ramen but oh well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Super close to little Tokyo as well. And parking was easy and quick for me. Overall, I will go again :)",4
"I read all the glowing reviews for their ramen so we made the drive to downtown, paid the street parking, waited through the lines and finally tried the ramen. Yes, definitely good. But with all the variety we have in SGV, I don't think I would be running back.",4
"Delicious ramen! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the Daikokuya ramen with the ""extra fat"" for more flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It came out in a huge bowl, which surprised me because most places I have tried charge about the same and give you a much smaller bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I truly enjoyed the flavors of the broth and the egg was cooked to perfection - golden yellow and slightly soft boiled. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I really liked the added touch of sesame seeds as well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I tried a takoyaki ball (fried octopus) from the appetizer list and it was actually pretty delicious! The menu had many options. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They had some tasty looking appetizers and they also offer combination options as well for just a few dollars more such has deep fried pork with rice, or fried rice, salmon, etc. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service was fast and friendly :)Tips: Not great for bigger parties - long wait, plus they don't have long tables so most likely your party will have to split up to different tables. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Cash only.",4
"Amazing ramen! Flavor is so rich! The only downfall is the waiting! We waited for 2hrs to be seated, other than that I recommend!",4
"Walk in and put your name on the list. If it's your first time, try and choose a time that is off-peak. Like get in when they open up or get there just after the lunch rush. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Definitely a hole in the wall, but the food is pretty amazing. It was a table for one, I was sat at the bar after 15 minutes of waiting. Granted, I got there just before the lunch rush. Some people after me waited around 30 minutes. Food - Delicious! Flavor was great and served at the perfect temperature; served, give it just a minute and jump right in. Salad was great, though it was simple lettuce and house dressing. House dressing was delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered their classic ramen with shredded pork bowl on the side. It's a lot of food! I can eat a lot, but this was more than enough. Shredded Pork Bowl was great! Service! 100% awesome. They were fast and helpful. They are back to back and won't waste your time with needless conversation. But they are on point. After my order, my entire meal was out with 5-7 minutes.",5
"I love ramen and I thought that this place would satisfy my 11 PM ramen fix and it certainly did at 12:30 AM. I was totally surprised that this place had over an hour wait at 11 PM. This place is extremely small and when I mean small, I mean all the people waiting outside cannot fit inside LOL. I did enjoy the ramen, but to be honest I felt like it didn't live up to the hype I was expecting. The soup had a more liver after taste to me and I don't like liver. Their noodles had a bite to them, which I enjoyed. Overall, I have to still give it to my other ramen place in my area. It was nice to finally try this place out, but sorry. This place was overhyped for me.",3
"Over 3,000 reviews later and still a hit.Went last night (mid week) around 6pm and we waited for an hour. There were about 12 parties in front of us. Still crowded like the 405 Valley Pass.Even with ShinSen Ramen opening around the corner, Daiko you haven't phased. You're still a beast.Ramen still tastes the same since the first time I stepped afoot many moons ago. Still serving up that XL bowl. Egg still runny (Sorry Kiki N.). Fried rice @ this particular location is still oily but still bangin'. Obviously business is still booming.Still keepin' it real Daikokuya Jtown.",5
"My favorite ramen spot so far in So-Cal! Lately ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've been getting my fix every Sunday night. It's cash only and I've always waited about 30 mins to an hour before being seated every time, but it's worth it. It would be perfect if they made an investment in pager technology to call the people who are on the wait list.",5
"We ordered the spicy ramen and unadon and they both tatsted wonderfully. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The egg cooked to perfection. I could not get enough of the gelatinous yolk. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I inhaled 2 eggs and still wanted more...lol...if I dont have to watch my ""girlly figure"", i would consume 6 of those in one seating. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They are that good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is worth to sell out $1 for 1 ^^",5
"I'm sad...I use to love this place.... I still like their broth, it's still very good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, I think the popularity of the place has affected the quality of the meal itself. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's hard to say it's their fault when there's a horde of people outside waiting. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Last night, there were 28 parties of people ahead of me.... crazy. So why did I decide to update my review? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When I ordered the ramen, the cha siu I got was minimal, plus it wasn't even a solid piece. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got bits of cha siu that seemed to be falling apart. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I hate to say it... but it might not be worth the wait anymore.",3
"Honestly what's the big fuss about this place? Fortunately I didn't have to wait long since I came during an awkward hour on a weekday during summer (still a line though). But if I had waited 30+ minutes like others, I would've been even more disappointed. I prefer the flavor of Shinsengumi (with the right adds on) and Slurpin Ramen Bar in k-town. Maybe it's the hype, but this place just didn't impress me all too much. It's definitely not a bad bowl of ramen by any means, but I don't think it's worth the lines and rave reviews.",3
"**Sigh** Always my first and only choice for ramen in Little Tokyo, but that wait sometimes really just kicks my behind. So I have no choice but to head over to the other hundreds of ramen houses in the Little Tokyo area. The thing is - there really isn't a substitution if this is exactly what you're yearning for.The wait can be a none, few minutes, an hour, two (I think that was the longest wait ever!) The location is small, a few tables and a bar area. Normally, I go for the Daikokuya ramen + stronger flavor (Tonkatsu style) and add a half bowl of the chicken and egg. Or the beef bowl is good as well. If you're feeling fried, the tempura bowl is awesome. If i'm totally hungry, the entire meal is gone. Normally I have the rice bowl to go for lunch the next day. hehe.And during the summer, I'll have their cold ramen/ramen salad thing. It's sooo yummy and refreshing. I love the vinaigrette/miso dressing. LOVE! It's only served during the summer! Enjoy it then.Parking sucks! I have to agree with everyone. Parking is terrible. There is street metered parking and lots all around. Hopefully you get lucky and able to grab a spot.",4
"after 5 years from my first experience with Ramen and falling in love with the real deal and exploring all over the US I finally had the opportunity to go back and this establishment still stands as the top 1st and 2nd place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The tonkatsu has this unique smokey flavor that is unmatched, and the lines are out the door! Always a great sign. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I can't wait to go back to LA...and eat this ramen again!!!!!!!",5
"I love this place. It's worth the long wait. I ordered the Daikoku Ramen and requested the kotteri flavor on the side because I had never tried it before. Loved the ramen, but I hated the kotteri flavor. It was just too strong for me.",5
"I visited this restaurant during lunch during the week and was pleasantly surprised that the wait time was nowhere near as long as I had dreaded. I ordered their Spicy Miso Ramen bowl and enjoyed the meal overall. I didn't think it was super duper amazing, but the food was still delicious nonethless. The service wasn't exceptional considering we had difficulty flagging down a server throughout our stay, but I'm sure it happens at any popular restaurant so I'm not holding it against them. Overall, I had a pretty great experience so I will be back to try other items on their menu. Good times!",5
"Dikokuya is very inconsistent! It's probably been 9 months since I've been here since the lines are so long. I used to frequent this place so much that I didn't mind waiting an hour sometimes. I could tell the difference in the food from years ago and now.Came here for dinner the other day and ordered a bento box with chicken teri, spicy tuna roll, and tempura. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The chicken was extra crispy as I ordered but the sauce was watered down. Spicy tuna wasn't very spicey. Tempura batter was almost like onion ring batter with a run down dipping sauce. Tempura dipping sauce looked like it was literally mixed with water looking almost like lager beer.Service is always good here and friendly, but the food quality has gone down.Sorry, not coming back here for a while unless food gets better! I'd rather go elsewhere. Disappointing!",2
"Quality of food: The food was great! My family and I ordered the ramen combo with the salmon sashimi, eel bowl, shredded pork bowl, and pork cutlets. The ramen noodles definitely lives up to its repetition. The only thing that I thought that was below average was the the pork cutlets, which was quite dry and a bit bland. We also ordered the tokoyaki and the California roll which were both excellent as well. Service: Excellent, the service was quick and the waitress was friendly and authentically Japanese. Price: Excellent for the quantity of food given. We ordered the combinations and got a sizeable portion of both the ramen dish and the side dish. We ordered other appetizers as well but that really wasn't necessary and we ended up taking most of the side dishes home as leftovers. Cleanliness: the building is quite rundown but other than that, everything else seems alright. Recommendations: Expect about an hour or longer wait time for the place but the food was served quite quickly. For first timers, I would recommend the combination ramen dish and sharing the sides with friends so you can try a variety of dishes. And the ramen is a definitely must order dish.",5
"The wait is probably worth it, at least once.Here's the breakdown:Broth: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Perfect, especially if you get the amp'd up version tonkatsu broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's very flavorful and spot-on in terms of ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodle: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Perfect also. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Well cooked, not too soft and not too firm. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Thickness is just right I believe.Everything else: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The egg was just right, as a soft boil-- I like soft boiled egg in my ramen the most! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Seasoning seemed simple but on point too.Overall: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place is likely the best ramen I've ever had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, the first time I had it, I didn't appreciate it like I should've. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It does take an experienced pallet to truly understand the complexity in ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think the only place that truly compares to the quality of the ramen here is Totto Ramen in NYC. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But Daikokuya has ramen that is exactly what it should be without trying to make it fancy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen is truly delicious.The Catch: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The catch is the 1-2 hr wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place makes easily enough business to expand-- but won't. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They're wait is incredibly excessive, and there's no air conditioning inside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_How is this possible in Southern California?! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Because of the catch, I would only go once or twice max. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait is an hour even at off-times. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_With all of the selection of ramen around here, I'm not wasting my time to be hoyty about my ramen.",5
I think people come because of the high number of reviews but it's really just ok. Definitely not worth the 40-1hr wait.,3
"WOW!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I tried a Yelp Top 10 of 2011 business!!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_=)A little under 3500 reviews, need I say more?",5
"3.5 hour wait! 80 parties ahead of us on the list and we decided to try to eat here anyways...(we went somewhere else to get a pre-dinner snack to pass the time :P). The place closes at 11 and we probably got in right about then. There were still some parties waiting outside when we finally sat down. I think they were still letting people in at around 11:30.I got the combination Daikoku ramen and shredded pork bowl. The ramen was very good although I'm not sure if I would ever wait 3.5 hours again for this thing. I appreciated that their broth wasn't too salty and the giant portion size. The shredded pork bowl on the other hand was amazing! It was pretty oily but I guess that's what makes it so tasty. The dressing on the side salad that came along with the combo was delicious (and fatty :P)Service was average, there's nothing really to note. This definitely isn't a sit and chat type of place with giant lines running out the door. People probably take on average 30 minutes by the time they get seated to when they leave. Cash only. Theres an ATM in the back if you're short.",4
"Really loved this place! Haven't had ramen this great since Tokyo. Was about a 90 minute wait and got scolded for having stepped away when my name was called. The gyoza was decent, the ramen noodles had perfect texture and the broth was a flavor explosion! I had the ""Daikokuya Ramem"" (first one on menu).Oh yah, parking is a seeeerious pain around here so you're best off stalling in front, putting your name on the list, then go spend an hour hunting for a spot.",5
"Ramen doesn't get better than this in LA. The venue is quite cozy and authentic. But be prepared to wait. The average wait time is around 30 mins for weekdays and can be more than an hour during the weekend and Friday's. There is a public parking structure right across it, which is convenient. And lastly, they only accept CASH, although there is an ATM machine in the restaurant.",5
"Came here on a weekday so the wait was only 20 minutes or so. Inside was dark and a little dated, reminded me of all the mom and pop shops in SGV. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen. The food came very quickly even though the restaurant was full inside. Ramen comes with a whole egg, shredded wood ear, two fatty slices of pork, and salted turnip. The egg was cooked so that the yolk was custard-like rather than runny, broth was rich and very flavorful. I still prefer tatsu ramen, but this place is a close second. Cash only!",4
Well worth the wait! Delicious ramen and fried rice- got the combo and it was amazing. Added my own spicy with spicy chili oil and chili pepper powder... That's the only reason we are minus a star. I'm used to the little cup of spicy magic from my ramen place in NYC.. Adds a little more smoky heat and garlic flavor. But still a very delicious ramen and rice was perfect! Would definitely come again and recommend.,4
"Always full so I always wait, but its literally the best. Reasonable prices, super great broth, cash only!",4
"When I hear Daikokuya, I think of a little piece of ramen heaven. This Daikokuya especially. Don't trust any other Daikokuya because I've been to all three (Monterey Park, Arcadia, and Little Tokyo). This one is the true gem of them all.Daikokuya Ramen. Two words you only need to know. It's a great simplistic menu with diverse tonkotsu flavors. If you see on their menu, they have a side note for Tonkotsu fans: the kotteri flavor. You must, no matter what, always order this... unless you have serious health issues, then by all means. But this kotteri flavor is so rich it brings every meaning of tonkotsu ramen together. For $8.95 you get a few slices of buttery cha shu, a soft boiled egg, a handful of onions, bean sprouts and bamboo shoots. It's a steal compared to other places like shin sen gumi! But I'm not all about the deal, I'm about the flavors and the noodles. The consistency, the texture of the noodles: everything was there. For those with bigger appetites, I'd suggest going for the combinations. you get a large bowl of ramen, plus a tangy salad and your choice of a small rice dish! I'm definitely a fan of the chicken egg bowl (katsudon). Although the wait might get long, don't worry because the longer you wait, the tastier your ramen will get. It's worth it. Or, just come at 5:30pm on a weekday. Maximum wait time was around 10 minutes!",5
"Goyza was insane and the ramen was top. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Excellent place, long wait.",5
"This is by far the best ramen I have ever tasted! To begin with, the wait time is long, but of course, I went on a Saturday night, so this is to be expected. Roughly about an hour, but it's worth it! Once seated, we ordered right away since we had the time to decide during the wait and the food was brought to our table quick! No longer than 10 minutes, but probably less. My bf and I both got the daikoku ramen with extra koteri-one a combo, which comes with a small salad and a side order of choice (tuna sashimi for us)-and gyoza. The tuna sashimi's texture was very soft and almost melted in your mouth. The gyoza had a light crust on top and meat inside was juicy with flavor. The Daikoku ramen was freaken A-mazing. The broth had so much flavor and was delicious beyond belief, but not overpowering. The egg noddles were the perfect so tasty and perfectly chewy. My favorite and most memorable item from this bowl, was the egg! I still can't believe how good it was. So much flavor in the yoke, the right amount of goo and hard boiling! It was just great. And the price wasn't bad at all. Seriously, all this was $35! My new go to ramen restaurant!",5
"When you come to Little Tokyo and find that there are numerous ramen restaurants, but only one with people lining up outside and waiting almost an hour to eat at, that's the ramen restaurant you should go to. We got the gyoza to start with and they were possibly the best I've ever had. Then we had the classic ramen, which was very flavorful. The service was good. Overall, it was worth the wait.",5
"This place is BOMB! Happened to stop by at 11PM on a Monday and it was CRACKIN'! The ramen was absolutely delicious and what I heard from the locals was that it was the best ramen around town. I really enjoyed it and my boyfriend was all into it too. If you're thinking about stopping by, DO IT.",5
"I got the daikokuya ramen with kotteri broth. After seeing so the number of reviews and rating on yelp, I was very excited to be able to finally try it. But to be honest, the ramen was very underwhelming. It was a pretty good ramen, and had pretty good broth, but it was nothing spectacular. It tastes just about as good as any other regular ramen place that's pretty good. I was also disappointed in the presentation of the ramen. For a place that's so hyped up, I would at least like to be able to take a nice picture of it before eating, but it looked too uninteresting to be taken picture of. The egg was boiled to a perfect balance of soft and hard but was served whole, and I'd prefer it to be served cut in halves.The ramen was good, but I could go somewhere else to relieve my craving without having to wait so long.",3
"Great ramen! (Ok my kids had the ramen, i had the broth &amp; fixins with rice aka gluten-free style) The pork broth is delicious! Even the California roll we had for an appetizer was sumptuous. Be prepared for a wait at this popular spot,but it's worth it.Close to the Japanese American National Museum &amp; easy parking.Ambiance: authentic, retro, cozyService: great - really nice &amp; even accommodated my gluten free needs.",4
"Packed to the gills. Wish I ate meat as those were the obvious best choices. When I asked for something vegetarian, it was kinda bland ramen. Ah well, at least nothing was killed to feed me :)",3
"This is one of my favorite japanese ramens along with SIlverlake Ramen. Be sure to come early during dinner time, ESPECIALLY during winter/rain/cold weather, because the line is always super long. I always get the daikoku ramen which is their original one that they're known for. The broth is rich and savory from the pork bones it's boiled in, and it's the right amount of flavor without the overkill of salt unlike many other japanese ramen places. If I'm extra hungry, I get the combo which is the daikoku ramen with a chicken/egg bowl (or a different side). It's definitely a lot of food, though, so I like to eat just the chicken/egg on top of the rice, and I never finish my noodles because they give you a good amount. I know they have the spicy miso ramen, but I wish they had a spicy version of their original daikoku ramen. BTW, cash only!",4
The wait is super long. At 1:20pm on Sunday it was still half an hour wait. The shredded pork is heavenly tasty. It's super flavorful with some crunchiness inside. The rice with a lot of sauce as well. It's a lot of pork only $8.5. I can eat a few bowls. Super yummy! 5 stars. The donkutsu signature ramen though is a bit shadowed by the pork bowl. It's almost no flavor and pretty normal topping and ramen. The broth is a bit better than other ramen shop. I think ramen in sf has better texture and flavor. 3.5 stars.,4
"I ordered the Daikoku Ramen and a tuna sushi roll and it was all delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Would definitely recommend coming in during winter instead of a hot summer day (like it did). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The restaurant is really small and very little waiting area, so plan to stand outside while you wait for your name to be called. During your inevitable wait, walk a few stores down to the Fugetsu-Do Bakery and pick up some rainbow mochi for you to munch on after eating!",4
"I guess my coworker and I were lucky. We had a conference at the Fed Building and they let us out before 1200pm for lunch. We stepped in 15 mins before 1200pm and were sat right away. Boy did it get wayyyy lunch busy right after we sat down (so lucky). I've been to Daikokuya a few times even before the place was really hyped up. Food is served up fast (good for table turnaround time), the staff are friendly and there's not a million items to order in your ramen. Pork/shoyu ramen combo with fried rice or just the ramen will hit the spot for you. The ramen is flavorful, noodles are sticky and gummy like, and the broth is awesome. Now I wish the crowds weren't super crazy! I guess you can't go wrong with 3,000+ reviews!",5
Long wait but worth it :)Daikokuya ramen with kotteri broth is quite rich and hearty. Parking is a hassle but you can find public parking structure(Aiso parking lot) near there $1/hr first 2 hours then $2 after that.,5
"I was not impressed... I don't know if it's because I expected too much or I came on the wrong day but the noodles texture was not good. My pork just fell apart, I couldn't find the pieces in the soup and the spicy miso broth was too bland for my taste. I really liked the chicken teriyaki bowl though. That chicken was super tender and the teriyaki sauce was just right. It was nothing special, just a mediocre ramen.",3
"Amazing ramen, especially being so close to school. They don't have a tofu option like Tatsu though.This place has great service and interior. You almost feel like you are in Japan. When I have a reman craving, I always come here. It's great for late nights and small groups!",5
ONE HELL OF A LONG WAIT...... NOT WORTH WAITING MORE THAN 15 min... MAX !!We waited 1.5 HOURS... Guess the joke was on me.Waiting outside... Expect to be elbow to elbow with homeless folks....no seating outside either.,1
"Bowls of yum!Adventuring around little Tokyo and you see that famous yellow banner screaming your name ""eat me,"" you just can't help but be in this area and not get a bowl of goodies may it be their famous ramen or rice bowls, yum! This place is very small and cramp, I suggest it more for datenight, you'll be seated faster, and the cramp space only means you get to sit closer to your love and maybe some strangers at the bar but hey make new friends ;) My GO TO dish has to be the pork bowl, yummy! The pork is cooked perfectly and just taste so delicious and paired with a bowl of their famous ramen you're good to go! Perfect combo especially for cold foggy nights in LA, makes for a great adventure night :) Be prepared to wait because it does get busy, quick. Also parking can be a struggle, so plan ahead. Happy eats, loves! ^_^",3
"Love the ramen, from the REGULAR to the SPICY MISO with their PORK BELLY slices. The broth is spectacular; ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_not salty at all. GYOZA for starters. If this will be your first time, don't hesitate to ask the servers for their recommendations. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Parking availability is never a problem. $5-$8 parking structures are all nearby. Street parking is somewhat hard to comeby. Luck be with you. The wait time is always NO LESS than 20 mins. Whether it be odd hours of the day, there always seems to be a waiting period but when you're craving for ramen, the wait is the least of your worries. This is RAMEN HEAVEN.",4
"Short review:Go when they FIRST open. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And I don't mean like 15 min after they open. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I mean like when they FIRST open! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We got there 15 min after they opened and guess what? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We had to wait 20 minutes. Not bad of a wait considering most people have waited for over 1 1/2 hours on weekend nights. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Good ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You either love it or hate it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Too bad they don't have spicy miso. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Don't make me say I told you so! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_GO EARLY!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not worth waiting for over 30 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After all, it's just ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Unless you're a Daikokuya virgin. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_=)",5
best ramen on Yelp?I'm no ramen expert butbest ramen I've had,5
"My boyfriend and I got hungry on our way to Irvine, so we yelped a ramen restaurant in LA &amp; stumbled across this restaurant in little Tokyo with high ratings. The place was packed, as expected, and we waited approximately 40 minutes before being seated (this was around 10PM.. I can only imagine the waiting time during lunch/dinner).The food:Takoyaki - 3.5 stars - the octopus was not tender enough but the wrapping and sauce was good (evenly distributed).Spicy miso ramen - 4 stars - the miso was not that spicy, but it was a good balance between spice and miso. The broth was a little oily but is msg-free. The sprouts and bamboo was a good addition to the ramen, and the cha siu (pork) is verrryyy tender and soft. Lastly, the seasoned boiled egg was made just perfectly.Daikoku ramen - 4 stars - the soup was delicious! Egg is great, cha siu is bomb, ramen is cooked well, and the bamboo/sprouts made it even better. Get this one over the spicy miso if you want a broth more drinkable and less spicy!Overall, it's a long wait and there's not much service since the waiters are all constantly working but the ramen is pretty good (and the price is reasonable)!",4
"I think this was the fastest wait time for me, a good 30-40 minutes. There's a reason why the wait is so long here. There are a few booths that seat up to 5 people, because they can add an extra chair on the side and a long bar area where you can watch the chef do his magic. This place is known for their delicious ramen. Unlike most ramen places, the Daikokuya ramen bowl comes with pork, bamboo, bean sprouts, green onion, and a medium boiled egg. Everything is included; not $0.50 or $1 for each addition. I believe the ramen is fresh, because it tastes so good! The first time my friend introduced me to this place, I was hesitant because I equated ramen with the instant mama noodles that come dried in a plastic bag. I was young and naive, so forgive me! This was my first real ramen, and I've kept this place close to my heart ever since. I'm amazed every time how the egg is perfectly cooked, soft and not too dry or runny, just perfect! The pork is also so moist and fatty every time. The broth is a little on the salty side, but I always love good flavor, so it's exactly how I prefer it. I always get the combo, because I enjoy the other small dishes that they offer as well. The combo with either the teriyaki eel rice bowl or fried rice are my favorites. I tried the salmon sashimi rice bowl for the first time today and it was so good! The slices were a little thin compared to what I usually get at other places, but it was enough to satiate my appetite. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The rice had specks of sesame seeds and dried seaweed that was so perfect with the sweet, soft, and moist rice. Bring your cash or be prepared to use the atm in the back of the restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Cash only!",4
"Favorite ramen place! We drive close to two hours just to have ramen here. The only downfall to this place has to be the wait time- it's a small place so seating is very limited. Also, they only take cash.",5
"Omg I've been thinking about this place since I was there last weekend! Lol I got the spicy miso broth, that shit was amazing! My mouth is getting watery just writing about it! Lol",5
"I was such a cheerleader for this place in the early days, I feel I helped popularize it to the point that I can no longer get in. Day or night, expect to wait an hour+. But once you're in, you'll forget standing on the street. Silken noodles set in a broth, miso-cloudy with flavor. Beansprouts, bamboo shoots, and green onions, wilt and flavor the soup. A boiled egg, stained rich brown by stock. Try the spicy tuna wrapped in shiso leaf, tempura-battered, fried and served with rock salt and lemon wedge. So good, you'll vacate your table as quickly as possible to allow the rest of humanity their bowl...",5
Yum! I really like how they recently added salmon sashimi to their ramen combo. You cannot go wrong with the ramen here and the rice that they pair with their salmon sashimi is amazing. The only downside is that you have to wait a really long time to get seated as this place is so small. Be ready to put down at least 1-2 hours to wait. My recommendation is to get some street parking so you are not hemorrhaging from parking fees in Little Tokyo.,5
"My friends and I decided to try out this ramen place when we visited LA. We were told the wait for 4 people would be 45 minutes to a hour so we chose to wait for our table. It was also hard to hear the host when she called our the numbers. Sometimes she'd call it outside the restaurant but other times she'd call it inside. It was a bit tiresome to have to keep walking into the restaurant to see if she called us. The hour wait became more than a hour and 30 minutes. Luckily, we walked in the right time and got our number called. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My friends ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and felt the spice was not there. They said it was mediocre and felt it had of a less than mild spice level. I got the house ramen and I loved it. We also ordered gyoza. The gyoza was extremely fresh, but it wasn't worth $6. The ramen wasn't expensive so I guess it's pretty worth. This place wouldn't be ideal for a party group of 5 and more since it's very small and confined. They only accept cash!!!!",3
"Prepare yourself to wait. Bring cash. Sign up and take a look at some reviews, get your mind right for your order once you are seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ramen is good, side dishes as well. Even the salad with the house made dressing is worth a try.It is worth the wait",5
"This restaurant, although delicious, uses MSG in their miso soup and cheap GMO (genetically modified) ingredients. If you don't mind getting sick diem the road, then you'll enjoy it. Choose what you eat eisely and ask questions. Most soups have corn starch to thicken them.",2
"The ramen here was decent. I think they were a bit too diversified and it showed in the overall outcome of the dishes, in that they were good, but not great. The salmon sashimi however, was outstanding. If that were to tell you anything about the restaurant, it would be pick one thing and do it the best you can. Mr. Ramen down the street has better ramen.",3
"This was a huge disappointment.Besides the 40-minute-plus wait, which is normal for good ramen houses, the ramen was nothing special. It was just SALTY. The Spicy Miso was NOT spicy..it was just tasted like salt with miso powder.I got the Cold Ramen because they had a Ramen Week half-off coupon. It was basically RAMEN NOODLES in SOBA BASE. That should be what the description is. It was nothing more than ramen noodles with super salty soba base. The pork was half-frozen and stuck together as well.Oh, not to mention they forgot my order and it took 30 minutes for me to get my Cold Ramen.",2
"The wait was around 1 hour which is fine because we just walked around the shops near by. It's a small shop without air conditioning so on a hot summer day it's really a killer especially if you sit at the bar directly across from the stove. Ice water had three pathetic melted pieces of ice in it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_-1 starTsukemen ramen was amazing. Best ramen I've ever had. I'm glad I got this because the broth at most ramen places is too salty for me. It's great for dipping though. The perfectly boiled egg and pork goes perfectly. I like their noodles, not too soft like other places. It was definitely worth the wait.",4
Yum! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Look for the yellow awning on 1st Street for delicious ramen. Come early or be prepared to wait because the place is small. Groups of four or less will find it easier to get seated. The dashi is very rich and satisfying. I don't think they have vegetarian options.,2
"It's 2015 let people pay with a card! Every time I come here they make me sit at the damn bar, which is so tight it's too awkward to enjoy your meal. They forgot the spoons. This place is always packed too, I mean good for them. They chose a party of two over us and I have suspicions it was because the guy was a biker and had a cool chain attached to his wallet and I did not. He also had a bandana. The coke was always filled promptly and the pork was better than silverlake ramen. It's hot as fuck in here tho. Anyhow, I still recommend this place. Bring cash and a pick so you can sign the check which is written on stone.",4
"I'm actually NOT a big fan of Japanese ramen.. but Daikokuya is the best I've had so far. I've tried Shinsengumi, orochon, and a few others.. but daikokuya definitely beats them. The soft boiled egg is perfection.. soup is not too salty.. i just enjoyed the whole bowl with no complaints. I would come back, and I would definitely recommend it. The only problems are: 1) the wait.. -_- horrendous. 2) parking.. I hate little tokyo.",4
"Cute, but small ramen joint. I visited on a Friday at 7pm. It was during peak dinner hour so the wait list was extremely long about 25 parties in front of us. On a side note, I've been too the location in MPK as well and for some reason the reviews are lower than here, but in my opinion the ramen tastes pretty much the same. Great noodle al dente noodle texture and flavorful broth. We ordered the Daikokuya Ramen and Spicy Miso Ramen. I love spicy foods so I preferred the spicy miso. Compared to other ramen places they put very minimal toppings unless you pay extra for them. Overall, I'm glad I got to try this location, but I'll stick to the ramen places in the valley or Japan. I wouldn't wait another 2 hours.",4
The last time I went the ramen was waaaaaaaaaay too PORKY!!!! I could NOT finish my meal...was very dissatisfied and felt gross. The bf really loves this place and even he! Could not finish his bowl of PIG! Haven't beem back since...,1
"Ambiance: The place is TINY and always crowded! It does have decoration though, so better than nothing.Price: Decent for a meal.Service: Lines are always long and the wait is terrible, yet people still eat here. Why? Because of the ""back fat"" and secret sauce in their salads. The staff works fast and efficient though.Location: Metered parking and lots to pay by hour/day are available around the block.Food: We usually order a combo and share.~Ramen with ""back fat"" yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_~Shredded Pork bowl yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_~Side salad with secret sauce yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_All are very delicious and flavorful. Once you try the ""back fat"" in the ramen... other ramens do not compare! Also have tried their Tuna sashimi bowl and shredded beef bowl... mmmmmm! Story: All my friends enjoy this place, the only gripe is the wait and how far it is from where we live. It's definitely a great place to enjoy some authentic japanese food though! Tips:~Avoid parking and long lines during rush eating hours. Avoid going in HUGE GROUPS.",4
Wait in line over an hour still haven't had any ramen I can talk highly of. It's alright the areas in little Japan town highly recommend going to that area.,3
"Be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours! The restaurant is a small, hole-in-the wall place, but the service is decently fast. I always put my name down and run across the street to the shopping plaza. There's plenty of small shops and bakeries to check out while waiting. I always come here with my boyfriend and we order the shredded pork bowl and the Daikokuya ramen. The shredded pork is super tender and flavorful. The ramen broth is delicious and they are very good about controlling the amount of fat. The portions for both are very generous so it's nice to order different things and share. Overall, I've never been disappointed by the food and the wait is worth it!",4
"Daikokuya is hands down the best ramen I've ever had outside of Japan.I've been to other ramen joints, ramen festivals, but Daikokuya is still my favorite. Yes, the wait is horrendous at almost any time of the day (unless you go and wait before it opens, or around 3-4pm), but it's usually still worth it.NB: Cash only - so come prepared!The original Daikoku ramen is still the best The depth and complexity of the broth and the delicious chewy noodles are perfectly topped off with the kurobuta pork chasu (the egg isn't bad either). The pork chasu is SO GOOD here -- fatty and meaty and delicious -- perfection in a bowl.The spicy miso version is also pretty good, much more of a kick, but not as subtle as the Daikoku. I'd love it if there was a blend of the two.All the rice bowls I've tried here are also fantastic, and the service is fast and friendly.Among the many solid ramen shops in the area, Daikokuya is the easy choice! Plus the portions are huge =)Tip: I like to put my name down and then go a few doors down to Far Bar for a drink while I wait. That's a win-win in my book.",5
"Daikokuya is my life. Ramen is a religion and if I have to worship at an altar, you can damn well bet that it's going to be at Daikokuya. LA is blessed with good ramen, so the hard part becomes selecting the absolute best place. The Sawtelle shops are phenomenal. Tsujita is legit. It's real good. It's not Daikokuya. While it's up to you to determine your personal ramen preference (are you a Shiso fan? Tonkotsu? Maybe you're in for the Tsukemen? I don't know you, I don't know your life!), mine is the fatty and silky pork broth by the fine folks at Daikokuya. If you love yourself you go whole hog and order your Daikoku ramen in the kotteri style. The opaque and fatty broth should shine bright like a fat and sweaty diamond. The noodles are a perfect blend of chewy and springy and every ingredient in the bowl works well. Not only are you communing with your gods, you're enjoying a helluva good deal. If you order the Daikoku Ramen combo (and you should) you'll be able to pair your giant bowl of ramen with a rice bowl with your choice of protein plus a delicious and refreshing cabbage salad. I generally opt for the shredded pork bowl as I've found it to be the tastiest option. $12.95. That's it. And it's enough for 2-3 meals. Yeah, waits are long. Yeah, it's cash only, but there are tons of ATMs surrounding the restaurant and no one says you have to come at the busiest time of day. Put in your reservation, count the number of names, estiamte your time, and go grab donuts at Cafe Dulce, macarons at Lette, or opt for a stick of chicken karaage in the Little Tokyo plaza and watch people make fools of themselves live karaoking outdoors.",5
"Ordered the Daikokuya ramen and the side salad. The noodles were scrumptious, but my friends and I found the broth a bit too salty for our taste. Ask for some chili oil and chili powder if you want some spiciness in your meal. ONTO THE SALAD! I'm not a fan of salad but their dressing was greeaat. Loved the sweet taste of it. Service was great. The waitresses were really polite.",4
"Well worth the one hour wait, good comes in large portions and is delicious service was great as well got the combo which came with a choice of an entree and still had a lot left over :)",4
"Be prepared for a wait. I waited for like approximately 20 minutes for 2 people which isn't so bad. If you sit by the bar it is hot and you will be probably sweating, you ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_could barely feel the ac. My boyfriend and I each ordered a daikoku ramen. The meat &amp; the egg was like the best part of the ramen, the noodles were like ehh, and the broth was too salty for my taste. The price range is decent. They only accept Cash. I wanna come back to try the spicy miso broth.",4
I didn't care much for the kotteri flavored ramen. It smelled very....piggy. The smell was unbearable though the noodles were very high quality. I would definitely go with the regular broth for the ramen next time. Perhaps you can ask for a spoon sample of the kotteri before you commit to eating a whole bowl of it. I also ordered the katsudon which was perfectly made with the right amount of sweetness and flavor.,4
"Been to many other locations of Daikokuya, the dining experience was fine. The little tokyo location has been the most praised one so i have to try it.Ordered the classic ramen, one of the bamboo shots tasted funny. After I walked home, I got food poison...so not gonna go back to try their ramen in a hot summer day again. Maybe I'll give another try when it's colder and everything can stay fresh longer, just maybe.They do have more choices than the other location. There goes one extra star.",3
"This is just a priceless experience. The food is grade A+++++, specifically the spicy miso ramen, combined with the fried rice. It's to die for. Get over here!",5
"My boyfriend and I came to LA on vacation. We're pretty big foodies, and we've heard nothing but great things about the Japanese ramen in LA. Before coming we looked up ramen places on yelp. Daikokuya was one of the spots with the best and most reviews, so we definitely wanted to try it out. Here are some helpful tips from a Chicagoan visiting LA! 1.) ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Park in a lot or a garage! Street parking is scarce. It's honestly impossible to find street parking, but there's an abundance of public parking lots/garages. We ended up parking in one of them, which ended up being $10.2.) Come on a weekday and write your name down on the wait list when you arrive. It's located on a small table just as you walk in. We came on a Thursday so it only took about a half hour to be seated. 3.) Sit at the bar! Seats at the bar seem to open up more quickly than at the tables. We ended up being seated at the bar before those on the waitlist that were ahead of us, and waiting for tables. 4.) Definitely get the Daikoku Ramen! Honestly, the flavor of the broth is amazing. The noodles, egg, and pork are cooked to perfection!",5
"I don't see what the hype is about! This restaurant (if you can call it that) is in a run-down neighborhood. It doesn't have parking. It's cash only. There's no take-out. The wait is exuberantly long, and It's old and not nearly as clean as a restaurant should be. The food is less than average, and not something you'd want to go back for. Don't waste your time!",2
"WOW WOW AND WOW. My family and I got here JUST before the 12noon on Monday! And thank the heavens we got there in time because as soon as we were seated, people started showing up!Outside, it really does not look like much. In fact I might've gone past it many times in the past without knowing it was there. I won't deny that the inside is old and small and bit too hot for having ramen. 5 minutes into my ramen and I was already getting beads of sweat. The food is really the best. THE REVIEWS DO NOT LIE. This is hands down the best ramen I've ever had in my whole life. Even the miso soup that came with my dad's bento box was REALLY REALLY GOOD. As far as I can tell, this place is 110% authentic. The extra pork chashu is definitely worth getting for 2.50. Both my parents were telling me how good everything tasted. Even my mom was impressed with their fried rice. I can't believe she ate half of her order! Even something as small as the salad with the bento box was so good. The mayo was so incredible. SO SO SO GOOD. California rolls which i'm not really a fan of were also on point. Everything is on point. Would definitely recommend but only if you can come early. Be prepared to wait if you can't come at little early. It is cash only and does not do take out. They will however give you a take home bag for your leftovers.",5
"I got the spicy miso ramen and it was delicious! The broth was tasty, smooth and not too oily or fatty, which was great. The charsiu was chewy and just fat enough. The gyozas were also worth getting!",5
"Daikokuya is amazing and the wait is well worth it!! It was a group of 5 of us that came the other day. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There were probably 11 parties ahead of us, and we ended up waiting an hour.My mother was growing impatient, but when we finally sat down and our orders started coming out... she saw what the wait was for. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Our ramens were delicious, although my spicy miso ramen was not spicy at all. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ended up adding a lot of chili powder. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But nonetheless, everything was phenomenal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was so much food, we had to take the half rice bowls to go. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They also have take out containers if you can't finish the ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And surprisingly, they do not turn into a soggy mess!",5
Just realized I am not a fan of Ramen...I ordered the chicken ramen combo which to me tasted bland...the small salad was pretty good though. I'll give it another chance sometime I guess.,3
"Service was great, wait was about an hour and a half at prime time around 8pm. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think there was a usc game too so there were a ton of usc jerseys around here.Service is extremely fast, they were always asking if we enjoyed our food and if everything was alright.The ramen was quite good we got the daikoku ramen and side order of corn. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was really delicious but and the gyoza. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The gyoza was really good too, everything was pretty good except I was not a fan of the takoyaki I got.",4
"Delicious!!! By far, my favorite ramen place and my mouth waters just thinking about it. Oh how I wish I lived in SoCal to devour this whenever I want. The wait is long, but it's worth it. Spicy Miso: sooo good! it's the best spicy miso ramen I've tried so far. It's not that spicy, but it's still delicious. The bowl is humongous, they really do not wimp out on the portions. You really get your money's worth! Daikoku Ramen: My friends love this and finished the whole bowl! They ordered it with the richer, kotteri flavor (back fat). I tried some of it and I understand what the whole rave is about. The broth is delicious and pork is cooked perfectly!",5
This is place made me fall in love with ramen! I first had it about 3-4 years ago and now ive been to almost over 15 different ramen shops and this place is still top 3!,5
"THE GOOD:+One of a kind ramen! Huge bowl! When getting the Daikoku special, make sure to get it Kotteri style for added flavor. Lots of bamboo shoots and green onions. Egg is perfectly cooked. Broth is jam-packed with flavor. Oishi!!! $9 yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_+Their house salad is out of this world addicting! I don't know what it is because it's so simple yet I can't stop stuffing myself with it. It comes with the combo.+Takoyaki is delish for starters. $5 yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_+Their rice bowls are amazing especially their fried rice and shredded pork. Make it a combo with the ramen. Highly recommended! About $8 for single order and $13 for combo. yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_+Menu is concise. They carry just the right choices. +Service is quick and attentive no matter how busy they are. I'm impressed!THE BAD:-Place is rather small so it's not ideal for parties 5 or more. yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_-The wait can be really long.-No proper ventilation. The temperature inside is way too hot for eating piping hot ramen. -Cash only.-Far drive from where I live. It's only a bad thing because I wish they were closer. TIPS:__Don't come at peak hours (lunch or dinner time). If you do, make sure you're not hungry yet.__Booth and bar seating available. Turnover is quicker by the bar so don't come with a group. Booths can seat about 4 people only. There's only one table by the door that can accommodate about 6 people but barely. __Once you put your name down, kill time by visiting the nearby Japanese Village Plaza. __An ATM machine is available inside if you didn't come prepared. I knew what to expect so no surprise with the bad. I left this place on a food high! Good food and good service deserves 5 stars in my book! Arigatou!",5
"You get a lot for your money and the ramen is the best I've had anywhere. The rustic ambience gives the place its charm, although the heat does get somewhat overwhelming. Also, if you're hoping for a place to have a private conversation, this isn't it. You WILL be eavesdropped on because everyone's seated so close. The staff are friendly and do their best even though things are always hectic.Expect about a twenty minute wait to get a table if you're dining in a group.",4
"No Way!! What the heck is all the rave about? Really??? I would Not recommend this place to anyone. I ordered the dish they are most known for and it SERIOUSLY lacked flavor, whether or not it cooks all night long(or whatever the heck they say about it).I really disliked my dish so I ordered the beef bowl. This was def false advertisement. It should have said beef fat bowl. It was just a bowl of rice and fat. Why would I want to eat chewy fat? How bout some solid beef? Seriously gross and a waste of money. Any everything is Pricey! lol ugh..Don't let the line deceive you. Even my husband...whom likes EVERYTHING...did not dig this place.Skip it.",1
"You will have to wait even at 10pm on a monday. We came here after the clippers game on an empty stomach. Despite 30 min wait, it was well worth it. I had ordered the spicy miso soup. The soup base was AMAZING!!!! And the meat..literally just melted in my mouth. I only wished they had a lil jar of sesame seeds on the tables like shin shen gumi. I would've covered my whole bowl with it :]",5
Amazing. Chasu pork melts in your mouth. Fried rice cooked to perfection. Definitely going to come back !!!,4
"Authentic ramen joint! just like back in Japan. Its got the look, feel, crowd and ambiance of a typical japanese ramen spot that I know and love. Maybe a lot like myself not only go for the food but just for that japanese feel. Sometimes the line would be outrageous just for a bowl of ramen, but I get it, sometimes. Whenever Im in dtla, I make sure to stop by here. The ramen at first taste was superb. Homerun. Service is fair considering the amount of customers coming in and out. Put your name on the waiting list, then walk around dtla, enjoy the sights, then come check back if you're next up, best plan there is.",5
"Delicious ramen noodles at excellent prices! if you love ramen, you have to come try it!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork bone soup base is flavorful and creamy, and the noodles are cooked al dente. Perfect! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Tsukemen, which is ramen noodles served with dipping sauce, is fun to play with but does not taste as yummy as the noodles soup. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_To stretch your dollars, order the combos for a regular bowl of Daikokuya ramen plus a small rice bowl of your choice like pork cutlet, chicken teriyaki, beef, eel, etc. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The only downside is the long wait time; friends and I (total 4 people) have waited roughly 1.5 hours to be seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But, the gorgeous meal is well worth the long wait! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Next time i go to L.A., i'm sooooo coming back here :)",4
"Overrated. I actually like the Sawtelle's location better. The flavor of their spicy miso ramen is much better there, although it's still not my favorite ramen restaurant. Beside, do I really want to wait 1-2 hours for this when I can go to Santouka and get a bowl of ramen within a 10-15 minutes wait? Just because you wait longer for certain places doesn't mean it'll taste better.",3
"Wanted to see the hype so decided to check this place out while in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We lined up before opening hours. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Good thing we got there early. The line grew long...fast! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Seems like they had 3 types of ramen bowls. We tried the Daikokuya Ramen &amp; Spicy Miso ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_As the other reviews said the Spicy Miso was a bit on the salty side--not too bad though. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Daikokuya Ramen was good, but I didn't get the hype. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We all agreed that it wasn't better than Ramen in Austin, TX----Ramen in Texas is better than Little Tokyo in LA? Go figure! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Anyways, not worth the hype. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Feel free to try it out if you're in the area, but don't starve in line just to check it out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Restaurant is tiny so it seems like it's more popular than it really is with the line being out the door.",3
"Honestly, I don't get all the hype. I've had the same quality ramen reheated from a bag from the grocery store. I walked in at around 1 pm on Sunday. There were people waiting, but since I was all by lonesome I asked if there was one seat at the counter, so I got seated right away. I liked the vibe of the place, very low key, Taisho era ads on the walls, the waitresses spoke Japanese. However, the lack of ac was a problem. It made eating hot ramen on a summer day pretty miserable. C'mon, this is LA, asking for ac is not unreasonable. But as for the ramen, ok, its not bad, but its not really good either. I thought LA was supposed to have the best ramen scene in the US, but if Daikokuya is supposed to be one of the best in the city, I gotta wonder.",2
"Rich rich rich creamy nectar of pig in my stomach with the house Ramen dish. Little garnish to this dish, don't want to distract the goodness that is the broth. Feels homey, the broth. The wait was about an hour, just enough time to pick up a milk tea and shop around (just don't miss when they finally call your name).",5
"Honestly, the 30-minute wait was WORTH EVERY SIP OF DELICIOUSNESS. This ramen was BOMB. It was the first time I've had ramen other than the typical Instant noodle kind and so I was a little skeptical about whether the price would be worth it. NOT ONLY WAS THE SERVICE GREAT (there was this one quirky guy who played around and made us laugh) BUT THE CHEFS DEFINITELY DELIVERED. A big heaping bowl of PURE HEAVEN. I would definitely make the drive to LA just for this restaurant. It was that good.",5
"The ramen here is rich and delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I generally go here when I have a guest with me that enjoys rich savory, but not so spicy ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I generally go for the Kotteri style ramen with an egg or two in the broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is nice and rich, full of flavor and worth definitely worthy of your taste-buds, especially if you're in the mood for something soupy.Portion is awesome, especially if you're not used to big bowls of ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The sides are just OK for me and mainly to supplement the ramen if you wish to head down that path. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I usually add one or two small sides such as the gyoza or a roll just for the pallete diversity.Last but not least:There are 2 other ramen places in walking distance. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Shinsengumi (for those that need customization) and Orochon (for the lovers of spicy ramen) that I like equally. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The deciding favor usually depends on the tastes of who I'm with.4 stars for good food and a good experience. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Be prepared to wait as there is usually a line.",4
I love ramen and this is one of the best like an old standard but what I love the most is their shredded pork bowls so getting the combo of ramen and small pork bowl is perfect! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their broth is perfect not too salty and delicate flavor of pork,5
"Been here a few times now just for lunch and I always get a soup combo. I had my soup with the fried rice and the shredded pork bowl. I liked the pork bowl a lot better than their fried rice. Oh and to start you get a small salad too. Yum. I've also tried their gyoza and even though it was good, not sure if I'd get it again. With the combo it was just a lot of food. I can never finish my soup anyways and I just take it for dinner or the next day.This place can get packed during lunch. So be prepared to wait. And of course... it is now CASH ONLY.",4
"Don't be fooled by this hole in the wall spot, one bite/spoon full of that broth and ramen and you'll be back for more! Caution: wait times vary from 30 mins - 1.5+ hours. I last went on a Saturday at 12:10 and we sat by 12:40 for a party of two. There's plenty of little shops to walk around to help pass the time.I like my food spicy so I always order the Spicy Miso Ramen. The broth it perfect, creamy and delicious! The bamboo was fresh, the egg was cooked just right, and the pork was tender!I sometimes get the salmon sashimi bowl comb. It's just to kill my craving for salmon since I am always craving salmon. I do like the bowl and the rice and a savory kick to it! All the combos come with a side of salad, and I am quite addicted to their salad. I don't know if it's because it's fresh or because of the dressing, I just know I can't stop eating it until the bowl is empty. When I do order any combo, I can never finish my ramen! They definitely give you your money's worth with each bowl, quality and quantity!",4
"Seriously the best ramen I've had! Think of butter/bacon soup! It's just warm and delicous. Yummy, yummy, yummy!",5
"Mmm, Japanese food and ramen, sometimes it doesn't get better than that, especially late night in Little Tokyo. I came here with my family from Canada after a day of shopping and we were spent from all the walking. We wanted something good and my brother suggested Japanese food. I don't think you can ever go wrong with Japanese food and this place did no wrong to us. Well, except for the 40 minute wait, but this is late night in Little Tokyo on a Friday night, what can you expect? The line should be indicative of how good the food is if people are going there all throughout the night, just saying. I ordered the katsudon while my family around me got the ramen, the shredded pork bowl, and the fried rice. I tried everything and all of it was good! The katsudon was a little bit on the soggy side, which I was a bit disappointed since I was expecting it to be crispy. The shredded pork bowl tastes amazing, but beware the puddle of oil on the bottom of the bowl. The ramen was top notch, as well as the fried rice. The service of our waiter was really good. He was friendly and he even helped us out with out order when we were having problems with the menu. He had a personality, which can be hard to find in waiters these days. I believe this is a good place to eat, even at the other locations, just beware of the long lines late night at this location!",4
"I honestly had really high hopes for this place. The yelp reviews are amazing and I truly wish I had had a better experience. I came here with my roommate on a Friday afternoon. We got lucky and we were seated in about 10 minutes. I ordered the traditional Daikokuya ramen combo with the pork bowl and the ramen just did not taste good to me. The salad with their house dressing was delicious and so was the pork bowl. I saved the ramen for the end because I had hoped I was saving the best for last..... I was highly disappointed. The first thing that threw me off was the smell of the ramen. It smelled awful. I figured this was normal and continued to try it. Really wish I hadn't. I've had ramen before and it was so delicious so I was so excited to come here and taste the amazingness all these people have been raving about.I know this place is known for its ramen, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. Props to everything else that tasted great. I know I'll be back in the future since my roommate loves this place so much, maybe I'll try a different ramen.",3
"Go to a nearby bar for your ""over one hour"" wait time. The food was delish. Something about the dressing in the salad and the like friend rice. Ummm ummm ummm. Then Ramen was good too.",4
"I've had a good amount of ramen in the last few years. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was eating over at Orochon when I saw the reviews on this place, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_so I figured I had to try it before I flew back. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We went there around 10:30am and waited for it to open. . We weren't the first people there either. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Good thing we came early because the line started to build. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The place looks really dive. I ordered the Daikoku ramen with the fatty broth and extra chashu. The ramen noodles were cooked right and the broth was tasty.. but not the best that I've had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I wouldn't wait for this, as there are probably better options. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think they should throw in some other stuff to give the dish some color.. It would make it look more appealing..I feel that a lot of times you can taste what you see. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The chashu and the noodles and the egg and the broth all looked like the same color. I wasn't a fan of their chashu here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They gave two pieces in the ramen, which is probably enough. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When we asked if the chashu was just one piece they said yes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was actually four extra pieces, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_we way over ordered. Also, it was like refrigerator cold?? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I felt like I was just eating chunks of fat out of the fridge. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Then again the style of chashu for the ramen between NY and Cali are different. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They char ours back home by burning the fat a little. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Maybe it's suppose to be like that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The chashu at Orochon was much better. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_As far as service, it was ok. We were the second table in when it opened but we waited a little while before they took our orders. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_In fairness, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I did use the bathroom when we first walked in (which reminds me of a gas station rest stop-there are a bunch of flies in it), but still. . We saw people eat and grab the check before we got it food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would say there was 20 minutes between the time we were ready to order and the time we got the food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would say, just ""OK"".. nothing special.",3
"This is my absolutely favorite ramen shop in all of California. Having been to about 15(not counting super terrible ones that are only ramen shops in name), Daikokuya wins as far as taste, consistency and service.Service: They are always nice, and move quick. Never had a bad experience. Only downside I guess(not really service) would be that sometimes the wait is really long. Like 1-2 hours long. I always try to come during off hours or right before lunch rush starts.Food: I love the daikokuya ramen, as well as their oyako-dons. I always get the combo and get some don to go. It's a ridiculous amount of food for 15 dollars. The only possible negative thing I can say about the food is that perhaps a little heavy on the salt? I do like to slurp most the soup and maybe that's the problem but my mouth has always left feeling super yucky.Consistency: Basically the most consistent place i've been to.TLDR; if you like ramen, give it a go.",5
"Very well made Ramen. The meat could be a little more tender in my opinion, but still very good quality. Spicy miso ramen is usually my go-to-choice which was what I ordered here; however, I personally like their regular ramen there more than their spicy miso.",4
"Probably one of the best restaurant meals I've ever had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their popularity is easy to see when you look around at all the shops in that area and see the line outside of people waiting to get in. The wait's definitely worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The building is small and cozy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A Japanese restaurant with an American dinner kind of vibe, which made me feel at home. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The waitstaff was also very friendly, kind, and attentive.We ordered the gyoza for the table, my friend got their fried rice, I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen combo with the beef bowl, and my girlfriend got the Daikokuya with a small tuna roll.The amount of food you get for the price is insane too. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For the same price as the Ramen+beef bowl combo, I'd probably wind up with an upscale burger and fries at some other place.All I have to say flavor-wise is that I consistently surprised by how good everything was. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their Gyoza is lovingly hand made and not just one of those frozen potstickers you may find somewhere else. They were very meaty and filling. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The fried rice was especially hearty and savory, probably the best thing I had there. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For my Ramen, the noodles were perfect, and the broth was spot on. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They don't skimp on the meat either! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My beef bowl was simple, yet very satisfying.I'm already planning my next trip. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_What are you doing on yelp? Go to Daikokuya right now!",5
"I like this place a lot, but at night, the lines get pretty ridiculous.Prices:They're not too bad, especially when you consider the combinations &amp; the portions you get...which are enormous!Service:Last time I came here, I asked for the salmon roe combo with my ramen &amp; they never brought it out, but charged me for the combo. I had to ask them to correct it. Kind of glad they didn't bring it out though, only because I thought my stomach would split open if I ate another bite. I was way too full.They're a bit lax on refilling your drinks even if it's not so crowded. Service is subpar here, boo.Food:I get that new ramen item that they have that consists of cold noodles &amp; a ramen bowl half full of delicious broth. It's absolutely nommmmtastic &amp; I'd definitely recommend it. Their miso soup is good &amp; their salad reminds me of an In-N-Out burger without the rest of the burger. I've yet to finish the salad because the sauce gets too filling. The miso soup that also comes with it isn't so bad, but nothing too remarkable.Environment:Small restaurant shaped awkwardly. It's kind of stuffy. The ramen bar is not as efficient as it could be. It's obvious they built it to give it an authentic feel, but if you can't hand over the bowl of ramen to the person at the bar, what the heck was the point of building a ramen bar?! Might as well just stick with a bunch of tables &amp; a normal back kitchen. You guys might want to rethink the layout of your restaurant a little bit. Thoroughly enjoyed my ramen here &amp; would recommend anyone give it a try if you're in the neighborhood.",4
"Always long line there but it is worth it.Most of workers seem Japanese, the ramen tasted like the one you eat in Japan.",4
This was my first experience with Japanese Ramen. I was very impressed with the quality and quantity of food! I had the combo ramen and fried rice. The salad was amazing! The ramen was amazing! The fried rice was amazing! I took off a half a star for the wait and a half a star for the parking.This is a place you go when you have that craving! So I'll definitely be back!,4
"This is probably makes it to my top 5 ramen places and ive been to a bunch in the bay area. Had to wait like a hour on a late Sunday night (around 9). At least they serve everyone who gets on the list before they close. I got the spicy miso. Perfect amount of spiceyness, good portion, broth was excellent, price was reasonable. Service was good. They didn't take too long to bring the food out and refilled our waters as needed. Nothing to complain about, just don't like to wait :) Parking was a beezy though, had to park quite a few blocks away. Nevertheless, I'd go back",4
"First off the inside is rad. Everyone knows that. They also know there's crazy wait times but that's pretty normal. It has a lot of hype but I think it's just fine. I got the classic bowl and added the kotteri (extra flavor/backfat). The bowl was huge and I couldn't finish it (sigh.) The broth with the extra flavor was good but it didn't keep my flavor attention the whole way through. They have garlic and chili you can add from the table or you can order fresh garlic. The egg on top was a little more cooked than I like with the yellow getting chalky at the edges but it was well seasoned. The pork was thin slices that tasted good, a little sweet teriyaki type flavor, but the thin slices get a little tougher in the soup. The noodles were nothing to write home about, maybe a little too cooked, but there was a lot of them. Overall its a good value for a healthy bowl but maybe not your everyday place based on the wait and such.",3
"From all the great reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this place spontaneous when I was in LA. First off, IT IS ALWAYS CROWDED. Expect to wait an hr or more unless you're lucky.Second, the place is pretty small. Cash only. HOWEVER, The ramen was delicious and the beef just melted in your mouth. The broth was good. Everything was good. Service was good.I would give this place 5 if the wait was't so long.",4
Came here after the Dodgers game we had to wait for a table it was about 20-30 mins wait at around 10:30 ish at night on a Sat. I got the Daikokuya ramen and my buddy and i split the gyoza. Ramen was good the broth was not salty and had great flavor. The gyoza was good too. If i'm in the area and in the mood for ramen this will be my first choice and if the wait is not long lol.,4
"This place is way over hyped in my opinion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not the worst ramen and definitely not the best. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the regular ramen combo with tonkatsu rice bowl ($12.95). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Pro - lots of food with the combo. The ramen broth was ok....it didn't knock my socks off and I would not wait an 1 hour for it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I also saw that they used packaged dry ramen noodles...is that normal at other ramen places? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I thought they would use fresh noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Anyways, the broth lacked the flavor I was craving, the pork was sliced super thin and almost non-existent, and even the soft boiled egg was a bit over cooked. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I liked the fact that they put lots of green onions and bamboo shoots.I would not recommend the tonkatsu. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was a really thick piece of pork and the breading was soggy and not crispy at all! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The best part of the meal was the rice...the sweet soy sauce mixture, onions and eggs were delicious! The service in the beginning was lacking. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had to flag the waitress to take our order. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But the food came out fast. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall, an ok experience at Daikokuya, but I would much rather dine at Tsujita or Santouka!",3
"My fav Ramen joint when I lived in LA!!! Hands down worth the drive from Valencia to LA just for ramen! For under $10.00 you can get authentic ramen that tastes so well cooked, the flavors are like an explosion in your mouth. Sizes are large that I usually never finish my bowl.Note that the location is tight and it gets packed esp during peak hours which seemed like all the time for some reason.",5
"I finally visited Daikokuya! I can't believe it took me this long to try out this place with 4k reviews with a rate average of 4 stars. But then again, I have so many places like that on my list and my tummy can only take so much!My boyfriend and I went here and waited 45 minutes for our table. It didn't mind us... there were a bunch of people waiting outside as well, and it gave us time to find a nearby ATM to get cash (as this is a cash only business). When we finally got our seats, we ordered the combo, where I got the ramen with a bowl of shredded pork, and my boyfriend got the ramen as well with a bowl of chicken cutlet. Prior to our main dishes we got a small salad, which was shredded cabbage with sesame dressing. You would think this would just taste okay but it was amazing!!!!! It was like eating cole slaw but with the best Japanese sesame dressing ever! We loved it. Then right away we got our ramen, kotteri style (which is the flavorful, tasty and fatty broth, which was recommended upon my co-workers) and also our small pork and chicken bowls. The shredded pork was amazing... had a great teriyaki sauce and the pork was cooked just right... tender and a little crispy. The cutlet was pretty thick... it was okay... I was thrown off by the egg on top which made it a little soft and not crispy as I like.The ramen was stellar. The broth had such great flavor, the noodles were fresh, and the pork and the egg was delicious. The ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ramen was served in a huge bowl... I was not able to finish but my boyfriend did. Being that we got the kotteri broth the ramen was very heavy but worth it.Service was pretty quick yet helpful, especially being that it was our first time. I particularly liked our waiter... he was also the host and he had cool eye glasses that he made himself. I thought that was cool.Overall, a great experience and after this I can see why this place is one of Los Angeles's most popular restaurants. I definitely recommend this place to all ramen fanatics and foodies in LA.",5
"The food was 100 % amazing why I'm leaving a little bit of stars was because of the lady taking people's names. Let me begin she looks like she hates her job and wants to quit so bad like sweetie if you want to quit please do? Not only was she really annoyed but she let an Asian couple who hadn't even signed up go in front of us, they need to wait like the rest of us? I Waited almost two hours for someone to just go in like nobody's business and sit down to eat -.-. I know people can see she just had a serious face but no her co-worker would greet everyone and smile she should learn from her!! Any way all in all if you want good food I recommend it if you want great service I don't.",3
"Cons:Long wait (expect at least an hour)Cramped space (small restaurant)Simple dÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©cor (not a fancy place)Pros:Unbelievable Ramen (5 out of 5, the best I've ever had)The 'Far Bar' is nearby you can drink at to kill time. (walking distance 2 minutes)Good Service (Once you've been seated they do take care of you)Cheap prices. (Ramen soup that you can share if you'd like, will cost you 10 bucks)This combination of pro's makes it worthwhile, I'll definitely be coming back again. Please note that you don't want to take a large party here. Don't take a number higher than four, the seating arrangements here are extremely limited and taking more than 4 people in a party would make your wait possibly much longer. Write down (Bar O.k) if you don't mind sitting at the bar-would recommend if its just you or you and a date. This place reminded me of the Brittany murphy movie where she learns to cook ramen, the place here has definitely mastered the art of ramen, you'll love your broth. They also have other food to eat here but I haven't tried any of it so please read others reviews for what to get. I recommend the spicy ramen if you're a fan of spicy.",5
"After much hype and deliberation my expectations were soaring. I was not disappointed.We walked around little tokyo during the 30 minute wait on a wednesday night around 9pm. Once seated at the counter, my stomach was eagerly waiting for this highly acclaimed delicacy as we ordered our food. We were served in less than 5 minutes. Crazy quick.The shredded pork bowl (over rice) was one of the tastiest and most memorable combinations of utterly fantastic flavors that I've ever had at a Japanese restaurant. After tasting this I really didn't want anything else however having ordered the combination meal, I felt obligated to at least taste the ramen. The broth was good, but heavy and fat. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious however a bit overpowering in itself. The noodles were thick and fresh however I'm a fan of soft noodles so these were more chewy than I prefer. The sliced pork was the best meat I've ever had in any soup I've ever ordered. So that's that. The medium boiled egg was superb and the bamboo shoots were perfect. Overall a nearly perfect bowl of ramen. Just a tad rich and heavy for my taste.I tasted the accessory salad which didn't disappoint me either. The dressing tasted like crab infused thousand island. They sell 12oz bottles for $6. Not too shabby. I also had a piece of my friends teriyaki chicken bowl and was once again, uplifted by flavors of joy. Each piece had a crisp layer of love over a perfectly seasoned and moist bite of heaven. Jesus I'm drooling right now thinking about it. It was damn good chicken teriyaki, however the shredded pork was even better.Our order of 2 combinations (so 2 small bowls of salad, 2 large bowls of ramen, and 2 medium bowls of meat over rice) came out to $27. Awesome.When I return I will most likely stick to just an order of the shredded pork over rice...though I'm convinced this place has many other pleasant treasures to offer as well. Overall, this place is well worth the price and well worth the wait. Highly recommend.",5
My bother is always raving about how great this ramen place... and as you know there are a lot of ramen places. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_To me they all taste the same until.. I tried Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Make sure you get the ramen kotteri...omg. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is no word ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_describe how delicious it is you just have to try it out yourself.,5
The wait was about 30 minutes. I prefer spicy miso soup over the other one but they need to make it more spicy because i didn't taste a bit of spice! But it was very flavorful,4
"Solid choice for ramen. Best in town? Nah.Been here a few times now. The big bowl of ramen here has yet to disappoint. I do really like this place but I think the hype may have gotten a bit out of hand. If the wait is long, consider looking elsewhere (Men Oh). The less popular places have the time to put more attention to each bowl.",3
Damn this place is good. One of the best ramens out here in LA. Theres always a line and it can get pretty stuffy in there but ohhh is it worth it. I always get the Daikoku ramen with the kotteri broth with corn on the side. This is a must try!,5
"After getting hyped from reading reviews, then waiting in a line for about 1 1/2 hours... was it worth it? Absolutely !!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Me and my friend wanted to eat at the best Japanese Ramen in Los Angeles and we so we came across Daikokuya on Yelp! We decided to get there early around 11:20PM and there was already an hour and half wait!! INSANE !!! The hype was building even more because the line outside was not getting shorter, people we arriving faster then people were leaving... As we sat down, we wanted to try everything!! We got one of the spicy miso ramen, takoyaki, cutlet and pork bowl...After tasting, I realized why it got such a high review and why the wait is so long... This is one of the few places I will ever go to wait for an 1 1/2 hour for some food!!",5
"I'm not going to bore you with comparisons including the words ""authentic"" and ""Japan."" ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Nobody cares.This is great ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Then again, serve me anything after waiting in the street for two hours and it's going to taste pretty amazing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Go to side: fried rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Holy balls I could eat that every day. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Probably the best fried rice I've had stateside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_(oooh that was close, almost went for the ""authentic"" vibe.)Tips: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Avoid wknds. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Don't bother if you have a group of more than 4. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Put your name in and go for a walk. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Walk over to Mikawaya afterwards for Mochilato.",5
"CASH ONLY NOW! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I know they definitely used to take CC's but not anymore.I think everything has been said about this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Be prepared to wait when coming here so don't come when you're already hungry! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service here is really good and they are very quick serving you. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They have 2 kinds of ramen, the typical ramen with soup and noodles in the same bowl and the kind where you dip your noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Combo's are available and it is a lot of food.Recommended:Kotteri style - adds a nice extra layer of flavor to your soup but also adds to your already expanding waist line.Egg and chicken bowl combo - the eggs are always cooked medium so the eggs aren't too dry and the chicken has good taste too.Shredded Pork combo - another good dish except the pork is fatty.Ramen and dumping tons of garlic and red pepper in the soup.Decent:Ramen where you dip the noodles - the pork is seared before you get it and so it has more flavor than the typical boiled cha siu pork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The soup is too salty to drink and leaves you horribly thirsty.",4
"Awesome food! Food took a long time to arrive but other than that it was a great experience! Come hungry, you won't be disappointed.",4
"If you're patient, this place is worth every penny. Friendly to carnivores and vegetarians alike, this restaurant is an amazing find. Forget about the Main Street plazas, and seek this place out if you're a fan of homemade ramen! I would go back here every day of I didn't care about carbs or sodium. So good! I also recommend ordering your ramen with extras, which are inexpensive add-ons that can make your amazing ramen even better.",5
"Daikokuya? More like DaikoBooYah, this place was good. I'll admit, we waited for about 15 minutes, it is a rule of mine to never wait an hour for anything, so when I saw so many reviews saying that there would be a long wait I hesitantly went. We arrived, signed in and sat down in the small corner with the rest of the people ready to smash food into their faces. You could see the look of ravenous hunger and jealousy on the faces of those waiting, they would kill other diners and eat their food if it was at all acceptable. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We on the other hand waited patiently. When seated, we quickly perused the menu and by quickly I mega there was no other way to do it, they have a small menu, but all good choices. We ordered the spicy tuna roll, the tako yaki, the ikura bowl, and 2 daikokuya ramen specials.The apps, were pretty good, the spicy tuna and tako yaki were as good as I have had elsewhere, nothing special, nothing new but very good. The ikura bowl (salmon roe) was ikura on a bed of sushi rice. This was amazing, I am not usually a fan of this but my wife is so I always try a little bit and even though it is not my favorite I have come to know the quality very well. This was exceptional, good quality row and amazing sushi rice. This is a very specialty dish, not everyone is going to like it, so if you have experience with it DO GET IT!!! Also they have Kirin on tap. #suckitsapporoThe main dish, the ramen was pretty good, the one thing that I really appreciated was that it was pungent, you know that it is real ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Japanese food if it is a bit stinky (natto anyone). This was pungent in a good way, you could smell all the ingredients, the broth was nice, the pork was literally the softest pork I have ever had, melts in your mouth, the noodles were a bit firm and that is usually ok because the hot soup is supposed to finish cooking them as you eat making them softer as you go along, but the broth was not that hot. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All in all it was good, a very good meal, I definitely recommend to any fan of Japanese food because it is very authentic and very Tokyo. Oishii desu!",4
"Daikokuya.. you have changed how I feel about ramen. My last experience with ramen left me in tears because it was so pork filled and meaty and disgusting, but now I can actually say that I am a fan of ramen.After going to the MOCA, Edward C. and I came here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After waiting for over an hour, we both got the Daikokuya ramen combos. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_He got it with fried rice, I got it with chicken teriyaki. We were hungry, don't judge us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The combos came with salads, they were whatever. The ramen itself was great. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It tasted homemade. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It wasn't too flavorful, but I mean that in the best way possible. Not too salty, not too meaty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I didn't try the egg that came in the broth, because I'm not a fan of eggs, but Edward loved his. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The chicken teriyaki was also delicious, and that's saying something because I chicken teriyaki is usually just... chicken teriyaki. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The fried rice was great as well.The only complaint I have about Daikokuya is the wait, but you really can't do anything about that...... so i recommend going there signing in and then walking around little tokyo to entertain yourselves :)",5
"One of the best places to eat ramen. It gets packed, and I normally wait 30min for a table, but once your seated they're quick to serve you.",4
"Man, I used to love this place. Don't get me wrong, the ramen itself is delicious. The broth is excellent. But the portion sizes have gone down immensely. The large bowl used to be so big I wouldn't eat anything all day so I could *maybe* finish the whole thing. Now the large size is about half the size it used to be and is 11 dollars. I get it, maybe people wouldn't finish their food, or they just realized that they could cut down portions. This used to be my favorite Ramen place but I barely come anymore. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you're not into gluttony like I am, I can see how this place is still 4 or 5. I would give it 2 stars based on portion alone, but it still tastes amazing.",3
"I finally got to eat here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their broth and egg were really good. Noodles not so good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Will I come here again? If the line isn't too long, yes but its not worth the wait. I definitely had better at other places. It is not bad- it is pretty good.Its just not as good as everyone says though.",4
"I don't even care about the wait or the ramen or that it's cash only. They get people in and out of there quickly. I've had the ramen btw, and it is good, and I didn't have to wait long. I had the cold ramen in the summer. Anyway, I LOVE the pork belly yakitori. The pork is thinly shaved. It's all about the noodles, but the meat dish is better than the veg option, which is still good. But the pork belly yakitori tastes somehow like a Big Mac, especially with the complimentary cabbage slaw dressed with miso sauce that they sell.",5
"Came here with a group of 6. We were able to avoid the hour + waits that I've read about. We had to split up though, but it wasn't too bad.. and it's understandable since the place is quite small.Had the ramen combo with tuna and a salad.The ramen was good, definitely more flavorful than the one in Monterey Park.. and they gave more meat it seemed but less bean sprouts and bamboo shoots.The noodles were a good texture and the soup was hot.The salad was the slaw type with A LOT of dressing which is exactly the way I like, so it was delicious.The tuna over rice was good, came with about 4-5 pieces of fresh tuna sashimi and a lot of rice which I couldn't finish.I took the ramen to go and the noodles didn't soak up the broth, so it was still edible the next day.I don't know if it lives up to the hype but it was good nonetheless.",4
Always get daikoku ramen. Super delicious. Love it. Ooo and they have ATM inside. Do not go across the street lol.,5
"Waited an hour to get a table...absolutely worth the wait! The combinations are a great value, as the portions will leave you satisfied and perhaps with something to take home. Will definitely be coming back to wait in line again! Btw, the shredded pork bowl is a perfect complement to the ramen.",5
Get here early or expect to stand in line. The Ramen is the best around!,5
"Dear Daikokuya,I love you. Let's be together forever. Yours,Erica",5
"Excellent food,excellent service. As everyone says there is a super long wait but its totally worth it. Plan on waiting at least an hr to be seated. But once you order your food comes out super fast. I recommend the pork bowl as a side if you get the combo. Super creamy, and savory. Teriyaki chicken was average. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The original Ramen bowl was amazing. Can't wait to go back.",5
"Another day, another ramen craving. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_First time trying this place with a coworker.It's true... It's a small joint and gets packed fast. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Going in on a Monday at 1105 AM secured us seats at the bar within a few minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A line quickly formed behind us. Yelpers recommended the ramen combo, so I got the regular ramen and eel bowl (also comes with salad drenched in pseudo-thousand island dressing) ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_for $16.95. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The salad I didn't care too much for. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen tasted simply delicious and had ample pork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Broth was not as salty as Orochon (and I didn't feel too bloated after) . ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And the eel was really good too! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service was quick and friendly, and we had a non-parking issue since we walked from our office. Really looking forward to trying the spicy ramen and other combos next time!",4
"The wait is usually ridiculous but, for me, it's so worth it for that daikoku ramen with the kotteri flavor. Who doesn't love some tasty, rich BACK FAT?! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's usually hard for me to finish a bowl within a normal amount of time in one sitting but I'm pretty sure I finished mine in record time. Great place to go with friends and share a pitcher or two of Kirin! Cash only, though. Wahh.",5
"Aww. I love the ramen here. The special kokuya ramen is on spot. The broth is nice (a little bit salty for me, but still nice). A big bowl compared to the Hakata ramen near there. Price is affordable. You cannot beat that price for a great bowl of ramen.Tip: you should come early. If you just come at 6 or 7 as usual for dinner, it would be a realllyyyyyy longgggg line there.Tip: Cash only.",4
"Everyone comes here and gets the special ramen (with koteri) and fried rice... and it was awesome!!I love ramen. I loved the fried rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They really are different than other places, and I've had too much ramen and fried rice in my life to count, and yes they are some wonders at Daikokuya.My friend and I left the Bay at 6pm on a Friday night, didn't get on the 5 until 7pm, speeded down California just so we could get to Daikokuya before it closed at 1AM... and we got there at 12:12am (my bday)! Phew. But they ran out of koteri :( I bet if they had koteri it'd be 5 stars. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We begged the waitress ""but... we came from THE BAY AREA......""and she said that they ran out since 5pm. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So we said ""alright fine""... but I'm thinking, if they always run out, and it's always ordered.. why don't they just over stock it? I sat in front of a sign that read ""card only in bills $20 and over"" the whole night so when the bill came I paid with card, but they said the machine was broken so it's cash only. Long wait - waited about half an hour - 45 minutes.. but well worth the wait! I really want to come back and try the koteri. So for those of you who want to try this out, come early for lunch! Enjoy :)",4
If my daughter could eat here everyday she would. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_LOVE their miso ramen!,5
"I have been coming here for 10+ years, I have never waited less than 25 minutes and it has ALWAYS been worth the wait. I have tried most of the other highly-rated ramen places in LA, and while I think they are all very good, Daikokuya remains the best. The noodles are fresh and cooked perfectly, the egg is wonderful and the broth is unbeatable, especially if you order kotteri style. The guys behind the counter look like sexy pirates while they prepare the ramen, and the wait staff is super nice. Plus, the decor is fun and original - it always reminds me of the fictional Champion City in Mystery Men.",5
one of my favorite ramen spots! sometimes I get the rice bowls too if I'm not in the mood for ramen. The wait is ridiculous but I live down the street so it's not too bad if you plan it right. I personally stay away from the peak hours.,5
"One word...delicious!Ok, I went here after an event in DTLA. My first reaction was...honestly...this place looks like a hole in the wall. Everyone kept raving, just wait until you taste the food. We ordered many items and surprisingly everything was more scrumptious than the next!The place is small and a little noisy and they ONLY TAKE CASH! It's worth the trip downtown. Love it!",5
This is where I fell in love with Ramen! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth and flavored oil with the ramen noodles and soft boiled egg are amazing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Yummy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you've never had real ramen before take the waitstaff's recommendations. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_That's what I did and I do not regret it! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'm still looking for a good ramen place in Orlando to compare it too.,5
"Wow!This is by far the best ramen joint out there in LA.I went here with my friend who never had tonkatsu ramen in his life.What we ordered was listed as so...1) Gyoza plate2) Chicken teriyaki Soup Combo3) Daikoku ramen bowl(for my friend)Everything was a Knockout experience. The Geography is very convenient considering the Metro Gold Line is 5 minutes away from This joint.Everything was worth the long bus ride from north hollywood station and back. Everything, Down to the last Strand of noodle.The service was quite extollable considering the popularity and crowd.The expense came up to $29.87 and I was Satisfied in a way you cannot comprehend. I Highly recommend this place.",5
"Love the ramen! The broth is simple, yet flavorful, and the noodles have a nice chew. The rice bowls are delicious too.Get the ramen and shredded pork bowl combo, and you will not be disappointed!Just go at an off-peak time to avoid a super long wait. Walk in, and write your name on the list, and take in all the wonderful aromas while you wait.",5
"This place is awesome!Their shredded pork bowl is delicious. I've also tried their gyoza, which is very good. Their servings are huge, so you can take it home if you don't finish. The pork bowl comes with a small salad and miso soup, which for about $9 isn't bad. I get that every time I come here. The staff are nice and attentive, even with the place always being so packed. Wait time for a table is around 30-45 min depending on how many people especially since it is such a small place. Also, street parking may be a bit hard to find but there is a parking garage if you want to park there. My suggestion is to drop someone to put your name on the waiting list while you find parking, that way it wont take that long to get a table.CASH ONLY! But they do have an ATM in the back.",5
"This place was really delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, the wait was pretty bad. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Some people might think that it's worth the wait... Not me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Even though I thought that the food was ridiculously good, I'm not sure any food is worth 1 and a half hours of waiting. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Call me a sucker... But at least I did get to try it.",4
"I just don't get it. I waited 45 minutes and I was reading so many great reviews and when we finally got seated and ordered our food, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_we were so let down. The ramen is mediocre. I mean, I waited almost an hour and I was so let down. Not worth it. And to make it even worse, the waitress was so rude! She ignored us when we tried to flag her down, and she plopped our meal on the table and just walked away for the rest of the time here. I am never coming back.",1
"Daikokuya is one of those places that every yelper has to grace just bc it's so popular. Every time I've tried to come here for lunch the line stretches on for days. Today I was in Little Tokyo during dinner time and noticed the line wasn't that bad, or so it seemed. My group of 7 ended up waiting an hour to be seated. When we finally made it inside the restaurant, I realized how cramped it was. No wonder it took forever. Daikokuya Ramen: Obviously I have to get the house special on my first visit. One sip of the broth made me realize why this place is so famous. It was so creamy and flavorful that I just wanted to drain the bowl, but couldn't bc I had the actual noodles to deal with. The noodles themselves were chewy, but nothing special. Next, I got to the egg, which had the most perfect yolk. How they infused the yolk with so much flavor is beyond me. Then, I bit into the chasu pork, and went straight to carnivore heaven. That pork is enough to make me never even consider going vegetarian. So fatty and soft, it melts in your mouth. I didnt even come close to finishing the noodles bc of how big the bowl was. Food coma guaranteed. I am in no way a ramen aficionado, but I know a good bowl of noodles when I see it. Daikokuya is definitely a place where the wait is worth it.",5
"Had the chance to go to Daikokuya for the 2nd time only... just like last time, planned on going to Aoi two doors down, but now they're closed for dinner on Thursdays also! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Aww!Excuse to try the ramen again. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Will it be good like last time? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_YES!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Broth was yummy and delicious like last time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tried the eel bowl combo with the ramen, and the eel teriyaki bowl was also delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Very flavorful and yummy pieces of eel. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The highlight was the semi-cooked boiled egg in the ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think this is the same type of egg they rave about on Top Chef! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The combo was $16.95, but came with a small salad.We also tried the Gyoza and the cold noodle, but I don't think anything compares to their ramen.I did notice though that they now offer Spicy Miso Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Maybe next time...",5
"To be honest, I've tried ramen all over LA and OC and I really don't see what the hype is about Daikokuya. It's not bad, but I don't think it's worth waiting 30+ mins over when there are other ramen places in Little Tokyo/LA that are as good or even better. I ordered the spicy miso ramen and it wasn't even really spicy. I had to add a decent amount of chili oil and Japanese chili pepper to get enough kick to the ramen. The broth flavor didn't really blow me away either. However, the texture and firmness of the noodles were good.The shredded pork bowl side was pretty bomb though. I haven't had a rice bowl side at a ramen place that was that good. Super oily, but also super flavorful.",4
"Finally made it in last night! There is usually a looooong line, but going in on a weekday night is probably your best bet to get seated right away and start eating.Daikokuya has an authentic Japanese vibe in the location, the ambience of the restaurant, and the fact that all the hot ramen options are all pretty much pork based. There's also limited options as to what you can add to your ramen. If you are looking for authentic Japanese ramen and are okay with pork, Daikokuya is the best. If you are not really a pork eater and enjoy picking and choosing what to put in your ramen, I would recommend Shin-Sen-Gumi, which is just a couple blocks away.As a non-pork eater, I opted for the Hiyashi Chu-ka without the pork. It's cold ramen, but it's still a delicious alternative! You can choose either soy sauce or sesame sauce. I ate mine with the latter.Right now they have a salmon sashimi deal going on. I would recommend the hungry sushi lover to take advantage of this. You can get a combo of salmon sashimi AND ramen for only $14.50. The sashimi is delicious with the complimentary salad that comes at the beginning of the meal.",5
Definitely worth the wait! The cha shu is amazinggggg and noodles are perfect. Love the broth especially spicy miso. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Can't believe we manage to find this small little joint on the first part of our holiday! Love it!,5
"Came here twice so far and determined this place to be mediocre. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the Daikoku both times; added extra garlic paste (condiments provided on the table) to add a bit more zest to the broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Next time I'll probably step outside the box and try something new. The ramen is tender and soft; definitely tastes authentic. The broth is very flavorful and a bit salty - just how I like it. There was a boiled egg in my noodle, but it was cold when I bit into it; not too fond of cold eggs in my noodles! There was a couple slices of cha-siew &amp; eh, they weren't that great. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They were a bit chewy and bland. There was a 35 minute wait during my first visit, but during my second visit we got seated in less than 5 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place is small with a seating capacity of around 20 persons. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service is great; our noodles came out promptly and our waitress came around often to refill our drinks. I would recommend others to try this place out if you're in the mood for noodles!",3
Cash only. Long line on a Friday night. Spicy miso ramen was AMAZING with a little chili oil added - it had tender kurobuta pork and the egg was yolky and good. Daikoku ramen with kotteri was super rich. It's worth the wait if you are visiting town and don't have the opportunity to go in the off hours.,4
"So I finally tried the famous Daikokuya...I personally like Japanese ramen. A lot of my friends say the soup is too heavy, but I can handle the heartiness.For the hour-long wait (starting at 5 p.m.), this place was A-Ok, just like the 3-star rating I gave it.I got the Daikokuya ramen with the salmon bowl. They forgot the salmon bowl, and brought it out when we reminded them towards the end of the meal. They were nice about it and kept apologizing. Things like that don't usually bother me in the first place.All in all, I liked the service. Would I go there again? Maybe way in the future when some opportunity arises and the wait is not an hour long.But I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place again.",3
"Cute little ramen house in Little Tokyo. A lot of love was put into that broth, and a lot of fat. It's very rich/heavy, full of meaty flavor. I'm glad that it's not very salty but more savory. I'm thinking the word ""umami"" would be appropriate to describe it. Haha. Skip the fried rice and save 199% of your stomach for the broth of the pork ramen. With such a big bowl of basically liquified lard, you're going to wish you had more space in your stomach.",5
"Either something happened to my taste buds or maybe now I just know better. This was the second place I ever had Ramen at and for a couple years was the only one I frequented. Then my curious nature got a hold of me and I started trying other spots. A year has passed since, and I just got home to type this non-spectacular, uninspiring review because that's how I feel after going here. I now know what kick I like in a Ramen, how the egg should be presented, and how a fulfilling yet tasty broth without an overload of fat should taste like. The spicy tuna roll and gyoza's are ok, and I had a sample from my friend's Chicken Teriyaki and that was actually pretty good. Besides that, there's usually an obnoxious wait to eat as well as the fact they're cash only. I'm going to bed now and will eat a bagel to get rid of some of the blandness in my mouth.",3
"*LATE POST*THE BEST RAMEN IN LA, because of their tonkatsu pork that literally melts in your mouth, and THE BROTH. Oh my God. I also loooove the cabbage appetizer. Worth the long line. Don't bother with the West LA and Monterey Park locations. They are NOT the same. Selection and taste, I mean. Same company.",5
I ordered Tsukemen Ramen and it wasn't as flavorful as I would like. It's a beautiful decor inside and customer service is good!,3
"I love everything about this place, except for the wait. They prepare the best bowl of tonkotsu(pork bone) ramen I've had so far. Their broth is unlike most tonkotsu I've had, theirs has the right balance of salt and flavor. The pork is tender and contains a nice amount of fat. The egg is fantastic, nicely boiled whole egg with soft yolk in the middle for that extra creaminess. The noodles are not too thin or too thick, just the right amount of chew. The bowl is pretty sizable. Service is quick.",4
"Pros: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_good ramen, kotteri option (thicker, fattier, richer broth), salad dressing (addictive) and can be purchased in a bottleCons: ridiculous wait, tiny interior, how gross you'll feel after eating the ""kotteri"" broth ramenOverly hyped imo.",3
"First time here, been trying to get in for a few years. The lines are long and it's a wait, but if you're not in a hurry then this is the place for you. Was able to get a seat inside to wait, but if not then you stand in a long line outside. Seen some of her food and noodles , looks good and smells good. Can't wait to dig in",4
"After all the hype, I wasn't very enthused with this place.I had ramen, it was okay. It was a bit cold and not as flavorful as I'd like.My friends got fried rice and it tasted like a pile of leftovers.",3
"Sat at the bar and drank sake with my ramen. Everything was delicious, service was quick and curteous. The wait can be long and there is other ramen close by, I usually come here during off-peak hours.",5
"We ordered ramen and fried rice. The noodles itself is not that good, but the pork and the soup in the ramen is so great!! So is the fried rice. It's the! best fried rice I've had.",4
"The ramen is decent but definitely overrated and strangely hyped considering the taste isn't spectacular. I've tried a number of combinations to improve the taste of the soup, but none of my attempts have worked particularly well. The noodles are a bit hard for my liking and the pork is also a little bland.The wait is almost always incredibly long and I don't think it's really worth it. It's honestly not a bad ramen shop, not at all, but its reputation far exceeds the quality. I hope to try their spicy miso ramen sometime soon, maybe that will change my mind.",3
"when it's hot outside, it's very cold inside daikokuya. Whichakws it perfect for a bowl of hot ramen.this place is open late. always crowded but the lists moves quickly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_street parking and there are parking lots around.bring cash and your hungry belly.",4
Best ramen I have ever had in my life! Worth the wait and worth trying their sashimi salmon don.,5
"I didn't have to wait in line at all because I went at 5pm. I would recommend for those who hate waiting in long lines to do the same. Seating is limited that's why the line gets super long during prime time. The washroom looks a little sketchy, but it's not terrible. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The restaurant only takes cash and the ATM machine charges $1.5 transaction fee. The portions are large so for the average male I don't think it's necessary to get extra noodles. As for girls, I couldn't finish mine, but luckily my boyfriend eats a lot. The ramen itself has a pretty savory broth and the noodles are really good. I would recommend going to Daikokuya before 5:30pm to enjoy an early meal and walk across the street to little tokyo plaza and enjoy some desserts afterwards. :)",4
"I've been dying to try this place because I am a huge Santouka fan and my boyfriend and I had believed that of all the ramen places we've tried, Santouka would be our #1 but we still hadn't tried Daikokuya. We finally got a chance to drive to LA and see what the craze was all about. The wait was about an hour which we didn't mind at all because it was right in the middle of Little Tokyo, so while we waited we quickly went to a bar just a few restaurants away from Daikokuya called "" Far East"", jugged some Sake shots and headed back in time to get seated. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and my boyfriend ordered the original Daikoku Ramen. The ramen came in a pretty large bowl with lots of broth and the right amount of noodles. I loved the spicy miso broth, it was flavorful and creamy with just the right amount of kick to it. Generous amounts of green onions, bean sprouts, and meat that seemed like it almost melted in my mouth. I would definitely come here again. I would have to say this tops Santouka just because the broth and noodles itself was absolutely delicious.",5
"Been here a couple of times. Finally decided to write a Yelp review. The first time we came I waited over an hour and really wasn't impressed, thought it was just okay. Decided to give it another try before the lunch crowd during the week so there wouldn't be such a wait. The noodles are pretty amazing, great texture. It's just the broth choices I don't like. I really wish there was a Assari broth option. Assari broths are clear and thin, usually flavored with more vegetables, fish, or bones cooked relatively briefly at a light simmer so as not to cloud the broth. I belive they specialize in tonkotsu broths. They are a milky, golden color and leave a sticky sheen of gelatin on your lips as you slurp them. The servers are really friendly and nice. Price isn't bad either. It's just not my cup of tea. A little too heavy for me.",3
"Great Food, lots of fun. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I really enjoyed the Vegan dish the chef prepared for me.",5
"SO Amazing! Worth the price! I got the Daikokuya special (the big bowl of ramen, a small salad) with the small egg chicken over rice. My friend got the same thing but with tempura! The service is so quick and friendly! Worth the wait and the price! We got there at 11 (when they open) and we were 27th in line. Had to wait a half hour but went by fast! The flavors were so good! I could not finish my food. I will definitely go again, and I will probably try something new! We had a group of 7, and we had to split up with 5 at a booth (with a pulled up chair) and 2 at the stools.",5
"I prefer Shinsengumi ramen over Daikokuya's because I prefer being able to customize my ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I found the ramen here to be a bit too firm for my taste and the broth way too salty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork was nice and fatty but pretty thin. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They also give lots of green onion and ginger, but I dont like the ginger so I had to pick it out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Our table also got the shredded pork rice and fried rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Both were pretty good but I thought the fried rice was better.I give give them such a low rating because of three things. The ridiculous wait time, the way their seated us, and the mandatory added tip. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We waited well over 45 minutes and they seated us at a 4 person both. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They expected five adults to sit in the small booth and would not give us a stool for someone to sit at the head of the table. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_None of us were overweight or anything but almost half my butt was hanging off the edge of the seat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When some spots opened up at the bar, we asked if two of us could sit there because it was just too cramped at the booth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The waitress made an annoyed face and told us to hold on.They added the tip right onto the total of the receipt. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tip is not mandatory so why do they have the right to automatically assume we want to give them 15%? We didn't see this so we tipped on top of the already tipped total and realized the mistake after we left and wondered why the bill was so high. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After going in and checking the receipt again, we realized the mistake but did not want to ask for the tip back because it would be considered rude, but honestly I do not feel like they earned such a high tip considering their service.",1
"Definitely the best Japanese ramen I ever had in LA. The broth is absolutely amazing, it was so delicious to sip the broth and then eat the noodles. I wasn't impressed with the tonkatsu though. The pork was too hard to bit. The gyoza was also your average gyoza. But, if you are in Little Tokyo, do come here!",4
"""A bowl of ramen is a self-contained universe with life from the sea, the mountains, and the earth. All existing in perfect harmony. Harmony is essential. What holds it all together is the broth. The broth gives life to the ramen.""This would be my fifth visit to Daikokuya. It was 2:30pm on Friday, and there was still a line! Wait was like 20 minutes, which isn't too bad, but surprising. I bring my out-of-country relatives here who have never tried ramen in a restaurant before as there is none to be had in their country. This is a pretty good place for first timers eating ramen. DÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©cor is old school and definitely feels like a typical ramen shop in Japan. Too bad it's bit too small, so if you have a big group it will require a very long wait any time you go. The service was a bit chaotic as it seems they are understaffed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After eating those egg flavored ramen noodles from other shops it is hard to go back to this style. After trying their kotteri broth it is hard to go back to the regular one with added back fats and slightly more flavor. The broth tasted a bit like soy sauce, very salty, which I couldn't finish. The Chashu was still one of the best in the business, as is their marinated egg. The ramen bowl is probably the size of my head.Despite some shortcomings, this is still the best ramen shop in Little Tokyo with a slight edge over other locations. Not the best in L.A., but still damn good!",5
5 stars for the tonkatsu - kotteri (the extra rich option) and spicy miso ramen. Hits the spot every time. The broth and eggs are superb! (The chashu is pretty good but I might prefer silver lake ramen for that)Took one star off for the horrendous wait time. I have to wait even after 11pm on a week night. Don't even think about coming here Friday or Saturday night!!,4
"Delicious ramen, long line but worth it. Nice tasty broth and moist pork. Cash only. Highly recommend this place",5
"If i lived in LA, i'd definitely pack on a few lbs. Especially if i lived near this ramen place. Sure, thry have an hr wait almost everyday, but its so worth it! The spicy miso was so flavorful and the noodles were of the perfrct texture. Plus the meat was so lean and not too fatty! However, the takoyaki was very doughy, but i dont really like takoyaki to begin with. Oh and their tea may be a dollar, but its like legit yummy green tea mmm...i wanna go back to LA.",5
Kotteri Daikoku Ramen wins. Always wins. Expect a long wait.,5
"Is it all hype? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Heard about this spot from my pregnant sister. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_She wanted to join us but had just ate a sandwich. Too bad there is no to gos. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Hahaha... we had the Tonkatsu to start. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Made with just the right about crisp..then we both ordered the Daikokuya special... broth was very savory, noodles were al dente... toppings complimented very well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The bowl was for more then one person... I managed to struggle to finish my bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not a big fan of the egg, too soft boiled for my taste...service ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_was great. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Only waited 10 minutes because it was a hot day after 2pm. No it isn't hype... it is tasty yummy good!!!",5
"((((((CASH ONLY!))))))Ramen noodles here are cook fresh right on the spot. Pork belly just melts i swear... It doesn't feel heavy at all. This is the type of noodle soup you want to have in your face during those winter nights. Unfortunately, this place is in Los Angeles and right now... It's getting hot outside. I can not imagine being inside this oven while it's baking outside...:/One of the con things about this place is that it's super popular. Fuxk me, dude. Which means the wait time to get a seat is ridiculous. Seriously. Is it worth it? I want to say, ""fuxk no"". But is it worth to try once? Then, ""yes"". Maybe a second? ""Yeah...okay"".Noodle soups under 10. Still hungry? Grab a combo with salad and rice dish for a few bucks more.",5
"I've been here many times, not sure why I haven't written a review. It can be annoying to go here if you don't time it right because of the long lines and limited seating, but if you go when it's not too busy, it's worth it.The broth is always rich and savory, the egg yolk creamy, and noodles firm. Oh man, when we went last Friday, some dude came in asking for non-pork broth, they told him all the broth is pork (DUH!). The waiter suggests a chicken bowl and the guy says he doesn't want anything fried--omg where do you think you are fool?! LOLJust a heads up if you have a lot of dietary restrictions, this ain't the place for ya! If you want that classic, great tasting authentic tonkotsu ramen, come to Daikokuya, just don't come during the dinner rush!",4
"According to my friends that live out here, this is supposedly the best ramen in the LA area. If the early morning line is any indication of that, then yes, this is the best ramen in town. The menu has various items but if I'm coming for ramen, I'm getting ramen.The broth isn't as salty as most places so that is definitely a bonus and the ramen has a good texture. If you like eggs in your ramen and just a few toppings you will love this place.I noticed they carry takoyaki but they don't carry chicken karaage. Come hungry and get here early. We got here a little after it opened and we had a short wait. Luckily, there were three bar stools for the boys and me.Prices are reasonable and if it's a hot day, you may not want to sit near the bar. I would come back here if I were in Little Tokyo. Get your parking ticket validated at the Nijiya.Oh yeah, it's CASH ONLY.",4
This place deserves a solid 4 stars . Love their ramen and you could order a combo to go with it . The beef bowl is very good as well. Definitely would recommend anyone to come. Cons: the wait time could be ridiculous .,4
"They short changed the pork in the ramen. The sashimi was not very good, ""cut incorrectly, and not great tasting quality of fish"". Tsukemono was good. Beef was good but not very well made. The noodles are too thick! Cooked incorrectly.",2
"A gazillion stellar reviews and certainly deserving of each and every one! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Having failed miserably at getting in the last time I was in the area, I was more than fired up the second time around. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait is indeed ridiculous even on weekdays, but thankfully my friends and I only had to endure about 45 starving minutes before being seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The vibe is very traditional with plenty of seating to make the wait here that much more reasonable than one would ever find at some top spots back in the bay.For those coming in with appetites roaring, I'd def recommend some Takoyaki as an appetizer - piping hot and fresh with tender pieces of octupus within. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Then came a wonderful bowl of joy in the form of Kotteri Daikoku Ramen laden with loads of pork fat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_One sip of the crazy savory, fatty broth and I was sold. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It didn't end there though. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Perfectly cooked Tokyo-style ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Amazingly tender chashu streaked to the gills with fat - slow-cooked and not seared like other places. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Mouthgasms from start to finish.To lay down some perspective, Daikokuya beats out nearly every Bay Area ramen shop I've been to and is comparable to Ramen Dojo (my local fave). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broths and ramen are pretty much neck and neck with differences lying in the topping variety. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Duck eggs vs tiny quail eggs. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Slow-cooked vs seared chashu. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All things considered, I'd probably lean slightly towards here for the sheer quality and value ($8.95 vs ~$12) over Dojo...not to mention the far more tolerable wait times.Next time, gotta try the Spicy Miso Ramen and the rice bowls =D",5
"After hearing so many good things about this place, I thought I'd give it ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_a try since I was in SoCal.I came here on a Sunday night and the wait time was ridiculous. After waiting 20 minutes, realized it was cash only so my boyfriend and I decided to walk a couple blocks down to the nearest BoFA ATM since we had time to kill. The restaurant does have an ATM in the back though. Finally got seated at the bar area. The restaurant is really small. It was kind of cool sitting at the bar area since I got to watch the chefs cook. I ordered the spicy ramen. The broth was very flavorful which is why I this place has such high ratings. The chashu wasn't really my cup tea. I didn't like the texture. It was too rich for my liking. The overall ramen was okay. The only thing that really stood out was the flavor of the broth. I also I ordered the gyoza. It was good.I wouldn't come here again and deal with the wait time.",3
"A bit like some of my other LA food spot reviews, this one also takes a surprising turn as the highlight wasn't exactly the item I came here for. Nonetheless, it's part of the dining experience, and I must say the salad and rice dishes here are scrumptious, despite the fact it was my 3rd dinner of the night already! Arrived here on a Monday night, lo and behold there is a wait. I forgot to mention, it's already 10PM. Sooo....nobodys been out drinking (if I may assume), buuuut, it isn't quite late enough to be considered a late night snack. 2 conclusions: 1) this place is really that awesome, and 2) underneath the glitz and glamour, LA is full of fatasses like myself. After about a 45 minute wait, we were finally able to be seated, at the bar area, no less. Initial thought: ""Man this is what it must be like to eat at a Japanese Ramen place"" ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Before anyone thinks to correct me, please note that I have a shitty imagination and I also forgot that we probably have a lot more space here for our fat American faces. However, what triggered this thought was the ample wooden decor, as well as the broth being heated a few inches from my face - a great marketing practice, I might add. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Keep in mind, that no matter how good the broth smelled, it's 3rd dinner, so my buddy and I share the Tonkotsu ramen + shredded pork Gohan combo (pause). Food arrives very quickly: Salad, Ramen and rice. We decide to divide and conquer while switching dishes once halfway through. I start with the salad and ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_my first bite, it was like hearing one of Ryuichi Sakamoto's compositions for the first time. For you e-tards it's like uhh....hearing the beat drop on something from Avicii. The dressing was so flavorful, sesame, miso, all shone through in a very well balanced manner, but It was something strong enough to where I though I could use it as a sauce for fries. Ramen: it was okay, I've had better...broth was well bodied and noodles weren't bad....but it was just mediocre is all. Shredded Pork over ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Rice: Another homerun for Daikokuya. The pork was seared a little which gave it a nice crunchy later outside, the sauce was portioned well. Simple, yet damn good.",5
"Cash only. Order it extra fatty (kotteri). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Loved the kurobota sausage. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The huge heap of chopped green onions was a bit too much, but the garlic paste condiment and pickled ginger were amazing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got the ramen combo with the mini bowl of shredded pork. I ended up eating the shredded pork for breakfast the following day. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I hate using the word ""yum"", but the bowl was definitely YUM!",4
Egh I went to try their ramen because of the Yelp reviews and I was quite disappointed. The wait was for about 40-45 minutes on a Sunday around 2ish. The ramen was okay spicy miso ramen however I got the combination meal where it comes with a salad and a side of meat. I got the chicken teriyaki and it was pretty gross my chicken didn't looked well cooked and the sauce looked quite dirty I was disappointed. Me and my boyfriend agreed we wouldn't come back we prefer our ramen at Kopan Ramen.,2
"Amazing food. Just, AMAZING. We came randomly on a Friday afternoon around 2pm, and it was completely packed! We waited for over an hour for 2 people. Not even at prime lunch time. But let me say it's absolutely worth the wait!I had the Ramen/tonkatsu combo. It also comes with a side of yummy salad. This is more than enough food. The ramen was good but not mind blowing. I felt obligated to get the ramen since it is a ramen shop. But man, the pork cutlet is VERY good. It comes in a small bowl (since it's a combo with the ramen) with eggs on top. I think I'm just going to get the tonkatsu instead of pairing it with the ramen. Definitely going back next time I visit LA.",5
"Gotta love a place you can count on for consistently good quality Ramen. Now that they have the Spicy Miso Ramen, I don't have to try concocting my own spicy blend (which is a hit or miss depending on my hand/eye coordination that day). Definitely go for the combinations - they include that amazing salad and a side order of something (I got the baked Eel - yum!). I'm usually full by the time the Ramen come to the table, but I ain't complaining. I will say, though, that the wait for this place isn't worth it sometimes. There's usually a line, and anything more than a half hour wait for me just isn't worth it when there are some pretty good alternate Ramen places around. Stay Cheerful ;)",4
"The original ramen place that seemed to launch a thousand ramen restaurants all over LA - and now that I've tried a handful of those other ramen restaurants, Daiko tastes more and more mediocre. Unless you get their ""fat soup"" for an extra money, their broth is pretty tasteless, and the meat is a bit tough, not tender. It's add-ons aren't that good either - their pork bowl add-on is dry, and I usually have to add the soup to it. Add in the fact that the location is small, not entirely clean, and that there's ALWAYS a huge wait, and I don't know if I'll ever come back here.",3
"I love it. I love it all. I love the grunge of the shop, how small and bustling it is, I love the spirited shouts of ""irasshaimase"" of the workers. I love the broth with so much depth it tastes like it has been simmering in the back kitchen probably since last year. I don't however, love the inevitable hour-long wait. Nor do I enjoy the notorious troublesome parking which is rampant in all of downtown Los Angeles. It is a testament to their food that despite these cons, I return frequently.",5
"This place is well renowned for their ramen.. probably because it was one of the first ones to come out in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait is long.. I went there by myself and it took me about 2 hours to get in. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And it is mainly visitors to the area.. like myself that you'll be in line with.I got their daikokuya ramen kattori style--kattori style is when they add extra back fat to the broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles were fine, but the broth.. was just too watery. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_What killed me was when I broke into the soft boiled egg.. it was too salty where I had to immediately stop eating and drink a bunch of water.The soft pork meat wasn't as outstanding as I had hoped because it was on the brink of being somewhat tender and not falling off the bone. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I honestly prefer Santouka over Daikokuya because their broth is more flavorful and Santouka's melty pork really is melty although at the end it would make the ramen broth super salty.",3
Why would you want to wait over an hour long in a line that seems to not ever move? Why would you want to find parking in Jtown to come here? Well because this place is the bomb!! That is why! :) Service when you do get a table is quick and very attentive. They will for sure fill your drink if you ordered tea and I love the tea. I am a stickler on tea but I do enjoy this one. Also loved loved the fried dumpling things I believe its called gyozo but don't quote me on that...people come here of course for the ramen but I do think they are missing out if they don't order the gyoza. I mean the crispiness and texture is just right with a good amount of flavor. Also they give you lots of green onions on top. :) What else would I say about this place. The ramen well the ramen to me reminds me of what a obese person would think to make and give to starving hungry people that have been waiting for hours to get a table. This thing is super huge..I can't even finish it let alone half way through! Sigh soo sadly I wish I wish they changed a little bit and add a mini bowl of ramen. That would be the best. :) Not everyone can stuff our bellies full of this! :) But I still love on this place and enjoy every bit of what I can stuff myself with!,4
A small restaurant in little Tokyo. It has very good Japanese food such as ramen and dun with very low price(less than $10). The bad thing is that it only accepts cash.,4
"This place probably doesn't need my approval, but this place has the best ramen and shredded pork bowl EVER. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Go try it, you won't regret it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Oh, and I would get there before the lunch or dinner around 11 or 4ish, otherwise you might be waiting for a good hour+.",5
I came. I saw. I conquered a whole lot of ramen. This place has a constant hour long wait at all times because its worth it.We ordered the Daikokuya Ramen special which is a must as well as the Shredded Beef Bowl which was delicious. Come hungry because the portions are large. Easily accessible from the Gold Line if you want to take the Metro.,4
"Logistics first. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You need to walk in and write your name on the list yourself. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They will call by name and number so remember both - sometimes the servers were hard to understand. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you are not quick to claim your reservation, it will be given to someone else. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This was especially tricky for larger parties - I saw them give a 5-top away to 2 people after giving the party of 5 about 1 minute to claim their table. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So stay on your toes, people. CASH ONLY!Now, was this all worth it? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not in my opinion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The salad that comes with the combinations was pathetic - just cabbage with pink mayo sauce on it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork rice bowl was pretty good as well as the gyoza. But we are here for the ramen, yes?Comparing this to Monta in Las Vegas, the ramen noodles were higher quality but the pork was not. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But there was more pork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The soup was not as salty as Monta but not as flavorful either. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I really didn't taste pork in the broth like I do at Monta. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was starving and wasn't really impressed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Kirin on tap and by the pitcher was a nice touch, though.FYI, the restaurant had a B rating when I was there. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All in all, it was ok but not worth the wait.",3
Hit the spot. Cash only kinda stinks but it's worth every dime. The servers are super helpful and food is fulfilling. What more could you ask for?,5
working good for us ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_a bit of wait since food is good and worth it  we loved our choices ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_people were polite ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_place was ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_clean ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_we had a good time,5
"They finally have SPICY MISO Ramen! Just went from 4 stars to 5!Been waiting for Daikokuya to Spice up their restaurant and they finally came around, Woot Woot! Never been more excited for a Ramen spot.Long Wait:The waiting process is Always longg (at least 30 minutes). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Thankfully, Far Bar is just next door, so I always end up going there to grab a drink. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Don't forget to check in once in awhile to see how far along the line you are. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I always get carried away at Far Bar, and Daikokuya ends up skipping my name. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Then, the waiting process starts all over again -___-Food:The Menu is pretty simple (a plus for you indecisive people). *raises hand*I always order the Gyoza's, Cali Roll &amp; ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ramen with Shredded Pork Bowl combo. (to be shared between 2 people)The combo comes with a tasty salad starter that always hits the spot. The Gyoza's and Cali Rolls are purrrfect. Gyoza's have a layer of crunchy on the outside and the Cali Rolls are soft and packed with crab. Now that they offer Spicy Miso, my life just became a little easier. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Because the bf lovessss Spicy food, one of us would have to sacrifice between Orochon &amp; Daikokuya, but now we can settle on Daikokuya hehe. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My win! The Spicy Miso could be spicier, even for my taste, but it's still an upgrade from their only-one-kind-soup base.Service: The place is small and they have enough servers so their attentive and service is quick! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just wish the wait wasn't so long; I'd def be coming here more often. Parking: I always park at the structure next to Izakaya Fu-ga because it's only $2 with Fu-ga's validation. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Since Daikokuya always has a long wait, I usually go to Far Bar to grab a drink, but before hitting up Far Bar, we also grab a drink at Fu-ga for validation purposes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We actually looked at the food menu for the first time yesterday and we'll be coming back to Fu-ga for dinner on a date night ;) CA$H ONLYBring enough for Parking too",5
"I cant compare with anywhere else in Little Tokyo but I was assured this was one of the best in LA.Cash only ..no problem ...isn't every Ramen hole in the wall . Why do people complain when its under 10 bucks for an entire dinner .I ordered the Daikokuya ramen with the ""extra fat"" ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_, I cant remember the proper term but its pretty good ..I did have to add some heat to the broth but other than that its excellent . only one drawback you cant make any additions .what no shitake mushrooms !I don't know if I hit this place at the right time on the right night but at 7 pm we were seated at the bar within 10 minutes .Oh and can some one tell me if the octopus balls are any good , I saw some fly past and they looked pretty 'amaze 'balls as you Californians would say .Little Tokyo is probably the cleanest tidiest Asian food area I have been , I would love to go back and try some more places .",4
"My first time having ramen and i was disappointed. I was never a fan of ramen (since I am more of a ""hoa-fun girl"") but this just reminds me too much of cup-noodles.We ordered 2 ramen noodles and the pork belly appetizer-those two were suppose to be part of the popular dishes and I was not really satisfied- it did not live up to it's hype! Yes, I am hard to please. it was plain and barely had any meat? Just like cup o noodles!! Good thing my boo did enjoy the ramen noodles, he said the noodles were really fresh but he strongly believes he could've made better soup based.The pork belly appetizer had too much sauce on it ...that was overwhelming for such a small piece of pork belly.",3
"We've been here 4 times and this is the first time we actually got a table. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They're always busy so best time to come is right when they open. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not ideal for big groups due to lack of seating but once you get a seat, you're in for a treat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_From the first sip of the broth to the last bite of their fried rice, the food is great. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I recommend getting the combo of ramen and a side dish.",4
Not the best but it will do the jobOverall:I would not drive to LA just to have it but it is a decent place if you are in the area. Also I do love they have garlic on the side.Service:Small place with a couple booths and bar seating. Service was okay not too courteous but I understand since it is always busy here apparently. Expect a wait here apparently there is always one. (Docked a star for it was not worth the wait.)Food:Spicy Miso Ramen - I have had better or similar in the Costa Mesa and Torrance area. It is good but I guess I am underwelmed because of the hype. Best I ever had was Shoku ramen in Las Vegas. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_*4 stars*Daikokuya with Kattori - This was pretty good but again I definitely had better elsewhere. *3 stars*Shredded pork bowl - This was actually pretty amazing. You could skip the ramen and get this or do the combo like nearly everyone else and take the rest of it to go. *4 stars*,3
Starting off this review by saying I don't even like Ramen. I've tried a lot of ramen places around OC and LA but this is legit the only place I've enjoyed. The entire meal is delicious and the staff is friendly and quick. I highly recommend eating here. The wait was 30 min but I'm telling you it's worth.,5
Best ramen noodles in L.A full of flavor! Wait can be long but it's so much worth it! The staff is really nice :),5
This is the number one spot in LA for ramen and katsudon! I love coming here! There's always a line but it goes by pretty quick; at least from my experiences coming here.,5
"I love Tonkotsu Ramen, especially Kotteri. And way back before Ramen had an explosion in trendiness, Daikokuya was THE place to go.Maybe it's because now there are over a dozen competitors in close proximity. Maybe it's because they changed something about their recipe. Maybe I've jut been coming in on off days. But the ramen here almost seems bland, and the noodles just a little off, in both locations. Were this the only place in town, this would be forgivable. But there's a lot of competitors with similar bowls of ramen that just do it better.",2
"the star rating is for the spicy miso ramen.(service was fine, we had to wait a little because it was time for those late might munchies runs. location is also okay, a little sketchy at night but completely reasonable if you're with people and a lot of the restaurants are open late at night anyway)my BF and i wanted to get late night dinner after spending all day touring around LA. we were both pretty hungry because we hadn't eaten much that day, and both of us found that daikokuya wasn't anything special.maybe it's because this place was recommended to me by so many people, or maybe because i got the wrong thing. my spicy miso ramen wasn't really spicy and wasn't really flavorful with those deep pork or fish broth soups that i've had in the past, and my BF said his tsukemen wasn't anything to write home about either.if you're a spice lover like me, i suggest not getting the spicy miso and going for something else. you may find it a more successful trip to daikokuya :)",3
Waited about a bit more than 3 hours and with a child. We had seen a crowd but didn't think it would be that much of a wait. Little did we know we would wait sooooooo long we had 5 people in total. While waiting we had to stand up and keep checking up on the number they called we had been number 42 and they had name 21. They had the bar for couples or single person but only booths that you might squeeze 5 in. After the long long wait we finally got a table and we got the Ramen of course that was the whole reason for the visit. It was really good but almost to the end we notice a family kept staring soo much and just breathing down on us it was sooooooo annoying that after standing for 3 hours we couldn't have a peaceful meal. I wish they would have an estimate of the wait and have an app where you can sign in and they will call you while your ready so you don't have to stand around!!!! Next time I'll just get it to go and sit somewhere else! That's your best choice,3
"I understand that everyone comes here for the broth that comes with the noodles, however, the Hiyashi Chu-ka bowl that I got was delicious! I couldn't decide between the two different dressings so the waiter brought me both. The sesame seed dressing was the winner for me. I absolutely loved this dish and I'm glad that I decided to get it. It's the best of their bowls in my opinion. The avocado, strips of fried egg, and the dressing made for a delicious and refreshing combination. :)I tried my sister's spicy miso and it was good but after a while she said that it was a bit salty. My brother and her boyfriend got the pork belly one and they both enjoyed it. (My dish also had turkey and pork; but I gave the pieces to my siblings)So if you're craving for some ramen, but think that it's too hot for soup, just try this refreshing dish. ;)",4
"Going to visit Japan soon, so I am actually trying to cut back on Japanese food as it is probably is the only cuisine I will be eating over there. Still, I was in LA so I wanted to give Daikokuya a shot. There are not a lot of ramen places in Seattle, so I just wanted to see how LA compares.Being one of the top 10 most reviewed restaurants in LA, I was expecting a wait here. And there was one. Fortunately as it was the lunch hour, the place clears out quickly. Got a seat at the counter. It was kind of hectic in here. Though good as I would expect this to be the scene in Japan when dining.The ramen is the main attraction here, though they do have other food items including rice plates/bowls, sushi and bento boxes. If you would like a mix, you should try the combo which includes an order of ramen with a small rice bowl which is an additional $2-5 depending on the selection.I decided on the combo for variety. Selected the Daikoku Ramen and small tempura bowl combo ($11.50). First thing served is the cabbage salad which has a ranch type dressing. Delicious.The combo was then brought to me. This is a lot of food, by the end of the meal I was stuffed. I could not even finish the broth. Though the ramen is the star, I have to say that I thought it was just okay. For a tonkotsu based ramen, I thought the broth was not that creamy. I have had better here in Seattle. The ramen started off fine, but then started getting tired of eating it.I will say the ramen toppings are good. The egg is a nice addition and the chashu was decent.Even though the ramen did not wow me, I really loved the tempura here. The tempura is a mix of shrimp and vegetable versions. It was fried just right and the tempura works well with the dipping sauce.While the ramen was not a home run, I will say it is a very competent version. Though it was overshadowed by my enjoyment of the tempura here.",3
"Came by for dinner on a summer weeknight and the wait was about a half an hour. The food was good as usual, but the heat was unbearable!There didn't seem to be any A/C in the restaurant and being seated at the bar by the kitchen didn't help.The Daikokuya Ramen was good. Noodles were al dente and the soup was thick. The cha siu fell apart as I picked it up.The Shredded Pork Rice Bowl was tasty as well, but the Gyoza was merely average.All in all, the food is still decent, but never come during the summer!",3
"We came for early dinner on Memorial Day and wanted to eat here due to all the great yelp reviews. One thing that was a bummer was the long wait - an hour. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is a small place, only 6 booths plus a counter. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So if you have 14 names on the wait list in front of you, you can do the math, it's going to be a long time. Maybe that was due to to the holiday? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is no place to sit and wait outside on the sidewalk, only a short stairwell next door. The service though was really fast once seated, it rivals Vietnamese Pho restaurant fast - food came out w/in 5 minutes of order. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen was really good, chewy fresh noodles, good broth, and the serving size very generous. My sons ordered extra noodles and couldn't finish, but then we all ordered combos plus got California rolls and an order of fried rice for the table. Overall it's definitely worth a visit if the wait was shorter. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If wait is that long, recommend trying one of the many other restaurants in the area. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen was good but we've had similarly good ramen before near our home in Orange County.",5
Amaaaazing ramen! Still one of the best I've ever had. The kotteri broth? I. Can't. Even. *cue heart eyes emoji,5
"Honestly ramen was pretty sweet even though i ordered spicy miso. That was a real turn off. The wait is really long, about an hour and the ramen has a weird flavor to it.",2
Finally tried &amp; approooooove. Definitely true authentic broth which is highly hiiighly respectable. Flavor was on point. YAYYY!,5
"The wait is LONG, but worth it! But I've also never had to wait longer than 20 minutes to be seated. The secret is to go on off times or go by yourself! :)HUGE portions, the noodles are just never ending in that big bowl of broth! Deliciously eggy noodles, rich creamy broth (that's not too fatty), menma, bean sprouts and green scallions and THAT EGG. Perfectly soft boiled and seasoned. Jeezus, I'm in love.Now that the Sawtelle location has opened (and IMHO, tastes just the same and no long wait! *fingers crossed that it stays that way*) I don't think I'll be braving the lines here any longer. Although off times are less of a wait!Service is friendly enough, and quite fast. If you get one of their ramen &amp; rice bowl combos, you'll have enough food for another meal! Or at least, I did. Parking can be a pain, but I've always had luck ferreting out free street parking. And if you can't handle the wait, check out Marugame Monzo next door! Freshly made udon YUM!",4
"MY FAVORITE JAPANESE STYLE RAMEN JOINT. Before I offer my perspective, I just have to note that there is a huge bias here due to the fact that I LOVE ramen..like I love ramen more than WALL-E loves Eve...yea..that much...so enough stalling LGI! My friends and I decided to eat here after school. My friend drives so he drove us from Ktown to little Tokyo (mad props). Parking is insanely hard to find. We probably had to drive around the HUGE block 3 or 4 times until my friend spotted a space and I kid you not, he got out of the MOVING car and dodged traffic to secure the space. Scary as hell...but tbh, we were all hella starving and mad craving for some ramen. After we parked, we had to put our name on a wait list and wait until we were called. The inside is pretty small. It can't seat too many at once, so if you're planning on going at night, definitely expect to wait at least 30-40 minutes.. After we were seated (5 of us total), the cute Japanese waitress asked if we wanted water with her very thick accent. The interior dec is really impressive the walls are lined with Japanese movie posters, a ton of red Japanese lanterns hung from the ceiling, and there's a whole bunch of Japanese rambling/yelling but it wasn't too bad since it contributed to the overall experience. All of us got the same thing lol expect I ordered extra noodles and extra chashu pork (so bomb). We had their classic ramen dish: the daikokuya ramen (figures). Now I've had my fair share of ramen all over little Tokyo and while they all have a similar taste and texture, for some reason, daikokuya stands out among them. They have a much more authentic flavor to the broth, noodles and premium toppings. The broth is delicious and hearty, the noodles are cooked perfecting with that signature texture ramen should have and the toppings...oh the toppings...adds tremendously to the dish. Their unique preparation of eggs is so rich and tasty. The extra noodles and pork chashu I got were delicious of course, but the pork chashu was so freakin tender omg..it legit just melts in your mouth..so good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall, this is a really legit ramen joint. It has super authentic decor and super legit traditional ramen. And once again, there's a huge bias because I love ramen so much...I'm like the real version of Naruto! This place is definitely worth a visit, no doubt about it.",5
Worst service ever! They can't even speak English. And they were so disrespectful and have no business skills whatsoever. I will not recommend this place to anyone! It's not even worth it.,1
"Love this place, such yummy ramen. Very fun and casual.",3
"To me, this is the tonkotsu ramen by which all others are measured. The broth is so good it makes my eyes roll back in my head. I didn't even have to wait very long to get in downtown. Nor did I care that it was a hot day! Just fabulous. I have been the other locations on the East side, and, they are very good, just not quite as good as downtown. Yum.",4
"Lets not focus so much on the ramen...How about that salad though?! The salad here is so good that every time I come through here I get 3 salads before my ramen. And it only cost a dollar?! Mind blown.Now to the ramen. I'm not really a ramen guy but having had ramen at other spots this is one of the best. I always order the original. Honestly, The salad has already pleased me enough before the ramen therefore I don't go crazy over it (it is good though!) I can't be the only one thats addicted to the salad. Or am I?",5
Ramen was really good. worth the hour wait.,5
"Decides to eat here last minute. We walked in on a Sunday around 6pm. there were about 10 people in front of us, but we decided to wait because of all the good reviews. We waited about 30 min. Once seated I ordered they're Ramen Soup for 8.95$ and my bf ordered the combination one. And my son ordered a California roll. The service was great and our food got to us within minutes!My ramen soup was HUGE and delicious!!! I couldn't finish it and normally I can eat lol.. The broth was thick and flavorful just a little salty. My sons California seemed old, I wouldn't recommend it.. Just because I'm sure everyone orders the soups and that's just sitting there. The only downside is the size of the place it's tiny, and a tad stuffy! The parking was horrible, be prepared to walk. When we left, the wait doubled in people waiting to grub.  But if you love Ramen soups, check this place out' I'm sure you'll live it :-)",4
The wait is very long but so worth it. I have tried many different Ramen spots through out LA and this is definitely my #1 !,5
"Trust me, the wait is sooooo worth it! Even if you're so hangry you can't decide if you're going to faint or want to gnaw at your arm. The house ramen is perfectly rich, delicious and has a great mouth-feel.... the noodles perfectly chewy and springy and the accoutrements inlcuding the egg &amp; cha siu... deeee-lish! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_*sigh* why can't Edmonton, Canada have a killer ramen noodle shop like this?! Now if only I liked LA enough to come back... which sadly I don't after this recent visit.",5
"Daikokuya is pretentious to the end.They're cash only, they require an hour-plus wait, and they gloat about themselves all over their menu.However, this praise is well-deserved. It's real good ramen with a deep broth and plenty of noodles, and each bowl comes out quite quickly once seated. Still, that attitude leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",4
"F*ck pho, pho is for skirts. Ramen is what's up. Being solo here had its advantages because I was seated immediately at the bar, otherwise expect a wait. But that's a good sign that you've made the right decision. Kirin draft, spicy miso ramen, and spicy shredded kurobuta pork &amp; rice on the side as a combo. Double Happiness-ishPlace is for real, cozy as hell and people were very accommodating. Make it happen",4
Not worth the wait. There's better ramen now available all over Los Angeles rather waiting to eat at this overhyped shop that became popular before the ramen shop boom. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I am not sure why people wait hours for this ramen when there's better within walking distance.Walk over to Men-Oh for better quality ramen and no wait.,2
"I was in La for a brief trip and had honestly never had really authentic Japanese ramen before. I was told the place would have a wait, but I wasn't expecting a 2 hour wait for 2 people on a Wednesday afternoon. We ended up going across the street to grab beers while we waited, so it wasn't terrible but I'd definitely recommend not coming starving or you'll be in for a bad time while you wait.Once we sat down, the service was very prompt and attentive. We ordered a pitcher of Kirin which was surprising my only $11, and each of us got the tonkotsu ramen prepared with the extra back fat added to the broth. After one taste of the broth, I immediately knew what the crazy wait was all about - this is the best ramen I've ever had. The broth was creamy, fatty, salty and delicious. The noodles were cooked perfectly, and the egg and pork belly perfect compliments. I did notice that once we left at around 3pm, the wait list was much shorter so I would suggest a weekday around 3 pm for the shortest wait",5
"Best Ramen you can find in the area, very authentic taste and service. The area is quite busy but if you circle around the area you should be able to find some street meter parking. Perfect for the winter weather.",5
"After a large dinner, I happened to be strolling down 1st street in Little Tokyo (don't ask). when I walked past Daikokuya. I saw a line of people waiting for tables (it was after 11pm) and asked what was good there. ""The ramen, man"", said a burly looking young fellow who was waiting with his bare-midriff-topped and sloe-eyed girl. ""Oh?"", I said, ""what kind of ramen? Is it tonkotsu?"" ""Whoa! I don't know man, you know better than me. It's good, that's all I know about it"". So I got in line. The line moved fast, and before long I was seated looking at the menu. A friendly Japanese waitress came up and asked what I wanted. I asked which ramen was the best, she suggested the Daikoku ramen. I said ""Great! I'm not even hungry but I had to try your ramen!"" She said ""Why don't you have a half order?"" Fantastic!After a few minutes my half order came out. I'm not going to lie, even with my full stomach, I ate the whole thing. And it wasn't small at all. If you're not famished, a half order will do you well. It's a super bargain at $6.95 too!The Daikokuya ramen broth is a smooth brown/tan color. It's opaque and completely silky and emulsified. I'm sure it's full of fat, but there's no fat in evidence. It has a pronounced toasted sesame flavor, so if you're a sesame hata this ain't the ramen for you, but I found it delicious. There were no off-flavors at all. The egg was perfectly cooked and delicious. The pork was medium thickly sliced, excellent flavor, and there was a healthy serving of it even in my 1/2 sized bowl. And the noodles...Well the noodles were just great, if you like the kind of noodles I like in ramen. They're thin, yellow and nicely hard and al-dente. Just perfect. What's there' not to love? The broth is soothing and rich, the noodles are perfectly cooked, the pork is delicious, the egg is just right. And the price is right too. If you're looking for really good ramen, I recommend that you look here!",5
"One of my favorite Ramen place to go to in LA. I would say besides Ippudo in NY this is where I would to get my ramen fix.It's a a nice little joint that reminds me of how restaurants in Japan looked like. They do not take reservations, so if you're really hungry get something to munch on because this place is always packed. They only take cash as well. They have an ATM there of you forget to bring $$$. Their Ramen is pretty affordable about $8 + Takoyaki as an appetizer for $5. If I'm craving for some ramen I definitely go to this place.",4
Mmmmm I can see what all the hype is about! It was definitely worth the wait and be sure to try to the kotteri! I've had many ramen places in LA and this probably has to top all of them.,5
"My friends raved about this place so much. I had high expectations. Food was okay. Nothing out of this world. You have to wait a while tho since it's always busy, but that's not a problem. Customer service is good too.",3
"If you are super hungry or short on time do not come here! It's hard to find parking and the lines are super long! That being said, if you got the time this places as pretty good food. I had the daikoku ramen with salmon sashimi bowel and salad and everything was delicious. The sashimi was super fresh and the house salad dressing is awesome. The ramen was very tasty and would definitely go again",4
So good esp when the wait is only 10min! The half portions- not on menu are great options,5
"Long wait times, but I don't mind waiting for their very delicious fried rice!! When I first yelped this place and read the reviews about the fried rice, I thought to myself, ""how good can fried rice really get?"" Let me tell you, it's the BEST fried rice I've ever had! As for the ramen, I've had better. Haha The service here could be better, but all I really care for is their food.",5
"Worth the wait. Authentically the best. Once you order, the food comes out quick. Huge portions. Go hungry.",5
"Yummm RAMEN!!!I was about to take the LAX Flyaway and leave LA but decided to make a stop at Daikokuya. So I ended up taking the 40 Bus from Union Station which made a stop literally a block away. I thank the heavens I made that decision and had the courage to navigate the LA public transit system.When I got there at 3:00 PM on a Monday the place was already crowded and I was ten deep on the wait list. I only waited about 5 minutes though before I was able to get a seat at the bar since I was eating by myself. The server was really nice and offered to put my carry on luggage in their staff room so I really appreciated that.I ordered the Takoyaki for $4.95 which came with about six pieces. Whenever I go to a Japanese restaurant and they offer this I pretty much always order it because it's one of my favorites. This one had a good amount of octopus in it, the sauce was not too sweet and the toppings added lots of flavor. I also got their infamous tonkotsu style Daikoku Ramen for $9.50 which was steaming hot and mouth watering with rich flavors. It can definitely verge on salty halfway through eating, but when eating it with all the components it is super flavorful no doubt.The atmosphere here is fast paced. You order quickly (if you can decide right away of course), you get your food quickly and then get your bill pretty quickly. I don't really see that as rude, it's understandable since it is an insanely popular restaurant. I just wouldn't recommend dining here with a group because there is literally no space to do that. Also, it is a cash only establishment so be prepared but just in case you're not, they do have an ATM in the back by the bathroom.",4
"I almost wasn't going to review this place because it's a given it's the best ramen place in LA. I mean if there is an hour wait on the daily, how is it not the best ramen place? It's a really small place, and don't expect fine dining, but who cares, the ramen is that good. The Daikokuya Ramen is a given to order. The best deal is the combo. Can't go wrong with the Ahi Bowl or the Pork Cutlet Bowl. The portions are probably the biggest out of all the other ramen places as well. The broth is what makes the restaurant and their boiled egg is the best! The service is fast which is great because if they made you wait any longer you'd start drooling on the table. This place is the hands down the best and you have to try it if you're downtown. P.S. They're too busy to take to go orders. That's how busy and good this place is.",5
"Ramen combination please! No wonder why there's always a wait, the food here is absolutely positively out of this world authentic Japanese comfort food. We arrived around 4:30pm on a Tuesday right before a Lakers game. The wait time for two was about 20 minutes. We were lucky and got seated at a booth. We told our waiter that we were trying to make it to a game, so he made sure to be extra prompt with our order. If you're like me and dislike waiting in line I strongly recommend coming here on an off hour which means certainly not the weekend. However, if you don't have any time other than the weekend, then arrive a few minutes before opening. If you miss that specific time slot you will be looking at a two hour plus wait. The restaurant is small, the service is a little dodgy. Daikokuya opened a second location in Little Osaka (Sawtelle) and the same rules apply. It's also small, so expect a wait. I don't care how good food is, there are 1,000 better things to do than wait in a line for a bowl of ramen. Be smart, plan ahead. If your friends are wishy washy about going or can't commit to a time, I'd say ditch them and go alone. There is a bar where tons of single patrons go and devour ramen like wild beasts. CASH ONLY. Parking is available everywhere on the street, 2 hour parking limit, and in garages $5 flat rate all day which is actually one dollar cheaper than the metered parking and dead center of little Tokyo.",5
"I would never come here during lunch or dinner. I would only come at a somewhat off time to avoid the long lines. There was a period of time when I was addicted to Daikokuya and came at least three times a week past 10:30pm. Just avoid the lines. Trust me. You will be grouchy as hell waiting for one bowl of ramen. The ramen here is so good though! One of my top three faves in LA for sure. Attributes to a great ramen are the broth, noodles, and toppings.-The broth here is rich and thick without being oily like at some ramen places. It has that hearty taste of meat without being overpowering or in Korean terms, nukiheh. -The noodle is perfection. I've been here over twenty times and I can tell you the noodle has been consistent every single time. Slightly hard and slightly soft at the same time.-I actually like that the ramen here comes with certain toppings and that's that. I suppose it's cool when you can customize your ramen but I like my shit plain and simple and not customizable (which is why apple is so much better than android, in my opinion! lol :-P). The egg, bean sprouts, and green onion are just perfect! I've tried a lot of their side items and they're all very good, especially the rice bowls! Seating is limited and if you sit at the bar, there may be some elbow touching with whoevers next to you. I'd recommend meter parking. If the wait is ever just way too damn long, try Monzo next door!",4
A must-have every time I am in LA! Always worth the wait! I always get the combo with the ramen and fried rice. Their fried rice is the most amazing friend rice I've ever eaten in my life.,5
"I love this place! I always go for the ramen, and their fried rice is amazing too if I have a really big appetite.Usually soup dishes aren't that filling for me, but this broth in their ramen is LOADED with flavor and is just right. The crowd is definitely an issue but if you don't mind going at grandpa and grandma times (5:00) you can get seated right away. Service is quick, and you can enjoy a walk around Little Tokyo post meal to walk off your ramen coma.",5
Yum. Got here at 11:30 am and got in at 12:30 pm. Delicious. The first minute of slurping the broth was heavenly,5
"As a vegetarian, you may think WHO ARE YOU to be recommending Daikokuya? Well my friends, I tend to eat out with people who crave this place and I want their company. One must make compromises. And when said friends come into town for a short period of time from another state and want to eat here, you figure out what to do to eat there. Went on a Friday night and we put our name in at 7:45 PM and were not seated until 9:15 PM. To kill time we walked around Little Tokyo, grabbed snacks from the lady who sells red bean pastries, and watched the fun karaoke going on in the plaza. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ What I ordered: the yakisoba asking for vegetables to be subbed in. It was surprisingly good. A little salty yes due to the sauce it was drenched in, but good. The noodles had a nice al dente firmness to it and the vegetables were still crisp. The noodles came with a simple green salad with some BOMB dressing. No seriously, BOMB dressing. There is a reason they sell the dressing separately. I think I may have liked the salad better only because of the dressing. Parking: Metered street parking. Parking is free after 8:00 PM at the meters if you can snag a spot!Tip: CASH only! So bring the cash. No such luck with the card. Seriously bring the CASH.",4
"Tried them for the first time summers ago with a friend and my 8 yo daughter since so many seem to love it here on yelp. Back to the first trip, my friend order the spicy miso ramen and salmon bowl combo which also came w a refreshing small salad. Another bowl or spicy ramen for my daughter and she almost ate the whole thing!!Been back a few times and still loving it.Too bad we always have to wait forever every time ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_but plan to visit other stores and come back to it in an hour or so.",4
"I do not know if the line warrants the food, but any time there isn't a line over 1 hour, I will surely come back",4
"Was really good, the broth is so satisfying. Seating took around 20 minutes, the wait wasn't as long as I expected when I read other reviews! Plus, the food came out really fast, like 10-15 minutes after we got seated.However, the wait is probably not worth it and the parking sucks! Overall I would come back if I happened to be in the area with nothing else to eat.",3
"The rumors are true --- you will be waiting awhile before slurping some tasty ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Two friends and I decided to dine here on an early friday night. We actually got lucky with the wait (less than 15 minutes), but again, I'm telling you we got there right before the crowd. Two of us ordered the Combination to share (16.95 for ramen + small item with salad), we weren't stuffed but weren't hungry (average eaters) Daikoku Ramen - Tasty with solid flavors. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Be careful not to burn your tongue by stuffing your face right away. I love how the broth takes on a nearly creamy texture. The meat is slow cooked and sort of fatty (in the good way).Small Eel Bowl - Good choice if you don't feel like noodles (although I'm not sure why you would come here if you didn't want noodles...). We were looking for some variety and went with this. It hits the spot for when you have that unagi craving. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Serving size was decent for something labeled 'small'. We didn't even finish all the rice.Parking: There are a couple lots in the area. I find that the garages are more frustrating to park in (small spots, lots of sharp turns, and a pain to just get out of) and if I'm only there for dinner, I think it's okay to risk it at an open Joe's lot (those are manned anyway).",4
"does this place live up to its hype&amp; wait?id say so. I have never once passed by this place and not see a 'line' of people but that only tells you this place must be as good as its hype. I waited two hours and when we were finally seated i had never been so happy to finally be able to order. no specifics in this review as there are already 1000+ to read from here o_o***however, one thing i would hope/suggest/wish to/for this establishment is that customers could leave our numbers on the waitlist or they had those devices for us to carry to know when our turn wasup so we wont have to stand or awkwardly try fit into the seats they do have inside. The wait time is a downside after finally having tried their ramen. Now that ive had them(no more wonder more so nostalgic) i do not want to have to deal with the wait and would rather go to another spot like manichi (two doors down)to get seated, served and charged less with almost as equal happinessas i would have had here plus alot less time it would've taken to wait here ; or some other ramen place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_sometimes hunger cannot wait :(",4
"The location of this restaurant is in the heart of Little Tokyo. The layout of this restaurant has a very small, but cozy feeling.The wait here is long, but there are a lot of stores that you can visit nearby while waiting. The fact that this restaurant is so busy always gives it a more homely feeling, in my opinion.The broth here is god tier work. It is SO good and plentiful! Be sure to order extra pork and eggs.. Oh so good. The consistency of the ramen making is great. I've yet to dry some of the other side dishes that Daikokuya offers.If you're near DTLA, this is definitely a restaurant to check out.",5
"Daikokuya is the BEST! In fact, it's so good that this is near-impossible to eat because of the ridiculous wait.Some people like the ramen because of the noodles, and other like it for the broth. For me, the broth is the key. The broth is rich, creamy, and flavorful. When you top it off with the chewy ramen, garlic and green onion, the perfectly fatty pork slices, and half boiled egg, you come away with the best bowl of ramen in LA.Daikokuya is great because in addition to the larger-than-expected bowl of ramen, you also get a side of salad. If you've ever had the problem of feeling hungry after finishing your food, at least you can know that you will leave Daikokuya satiated and content.",5
"This is my second favorite ramen spot. It used to be #1, until I tried Santouka. I don't mind waiting in line to eat here because I know once I do get my huge bowl of ramen, it will be hot and delicious. Portions are huge and I am always completely satisfied. The pork is good and I'm a fan of the soft-boiled egg. I like the gyoza appetizer and I think their fried rice is sooo yummy. They are consistently good and the service is fast. I've been to a different location but I truly believe that the Little Tokyo spot is the best.Tips:Come early to avoid the dining rush.Be prepared to wait if you do come during a peak time.After you sign in, walk around the Village while you wait!",4
This is not all that what people make it seem. The ramen is average. The taste is just blah..... There are other place that have delicious ramen like Silverlake ramen or San Sum Tei yum,2
"Does Daikokuya have the best ramen in North America? Some would say so. Personally, it's not the clear front runner, but it was still darn good.My gf loves ramen. She won't ever stop talking about it. She wants to name her future ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_kid ""Tonkotsu,"" and dress him/her up in a noodle costume for Halloween. I was told to save some Daikokuya ramen in a to-go box and leave it in the car. I thought it was an odd request at first, but then realized that she wanted to smell ramen whenever she was in the car. Sometimes for our dates, she'll douse me in cup ramen and just sit and watch me squirm. It was weird at first, but now I enjoy it.But, enough of my troubles... we ordered the Spicy Miso ramen, Daikoku ramen, and the Shredded Pork Bowl. Nothing was salty (a good thing); it all tasted natural. The noodles were plump and the pork was lightly seasoned (a good thing). The Spicy Miso soup had just the right amount of spice, but, the spiciness made the pork taste less porky. We should have passed up on the Shredded Pork Bowl, though. If I weren't so full after slurping my last noodle (that's what she said?), I would've dumped the broth into a styro-foam cup to sip on the rest of the day.Note: show up early and expect a short wait. We got there at 10:50 on a Friday, so once they opened at 11, we easily got a seat, but others weren't so lucky.",4
"YES I JUST LOVE A GOOD RAMEN PLACE.My sisters and I came here on a busy Saturday for lunch and we waited almost an hour for a seat. It was so worth it. The flavors and aromas just mixed so beautifully and by the time I got my bowl I was salivating like Pavlov's dog. I got the Daikokuya with the pulled pork w/ rice. THE PULLED PORK WITH RICE. I couldn't get enough of that. Even a couple hours later, it was soooo good. The waitresses were very efficient and friendly. I'd def come back!",4
Well worth the wait. Get the shredded pork bowl combo so you can sample the Ramen with a side. Delicious.,5
"3.5 Actually so hold your horses hahaA few pointers. It's cash only so be prepared. Also know the number you wrote your name on the list on because the server is not going to call your name.A bunch of ppl I know had been raving about this place and when I saw that it had beyond 5000 reviews, I absolutely wanted to give it a go. A friend of mine and I drove from San Diego to try this place out. Waited in the expected line but it was double the time waitress had anticipated (she said thirty, we waited an hour ... Which is problematic when you're running on a parking meter). Was seated at the bar and I totally digged the vibe inside. Our server was friendly and when it was time to order, we chose the Daikokuya ramen. My opinion of it? It could've been much warmer when it came out. Broth was a little more pungent and strong than what I normally have back home. Overall, it was a good bowl of ramen, but I've honestly had better. Our server was nice but the other waitress was totally impersonal and semi rude. I would come back to try the spicy miso but the next time I come, it'll be during opening because I ain't waiting for an hour again.",3
"Lives up to the hype! It was an hour wait on a rainy Friday night. We headed straight there as soon as we arrived in LA. You know it has to be good, if people in Norcal are talking about how awesome the ramen here is. And they were right! It's just my type of ramen. Not too oily nor salty, the egg is cooked to perfection, and the broth tastes eggy and meaty. The chatsu pork they put in is fatty, which I love! Because it just melts in your mouth and it breaks so easily with a pair of chopsticks. Oh man, what a delicious humongous bowl of ramen.My friend ordered the shredded pork bowl which was amazing also! I had to eat some of hers too because the concept is simple but brilliant. Shredded up pork and crunchy pork skin over rice, covered in unagi sauce with tons of green onions for garnishing! This might be even better than the ramen! I just wanted to keep alternating between the two bowls, it was just so soo sooo good.We had our kind waiter recommend some appetizers. He said the fried spicy tuna and gyozas were good so we got both! I LOVED the gyozas! The meat was so flavorful, it actually looks like a potsticker eggroll more than a gyoza. Best gyoza I've ever had! Seriously. The fried spicy tuna was good too, it was wrapped in a basil leave so it reminded me of some Vietnamese flavors. I'm not a big fan of tuna, because I think it's so tasteless, but with this appetizer, I have no complaints.I've never been to Japan, but I can only imagine the street food there to be like Daikokuya. Simply delicious.",5
Best Ramen in LA. Have the house noodle soup Koteri style. It's worth the wait. Put your name down and pop down to the Far Bar for a cocktail.The first and the last word when it comes to Ramen in LA.,5
"This review is long due. I went here one time, waited for two hours in line, went inside a narrow small restaurant and sat down not knowing what to expect. I just trusted my two friends, Drue and Jesse.Well let me put it this way. It was worth the wait. No wonder we had to wait that long. The ramen and the broth were perfect. The missing star is for the wait. With a limited lunch hour I can't wait that long.",4
"I've been here twice, and I'm a little undecided about this place, and not sure if it's worth it to come back. I'll admit -- I'm not a HUGE fan of ramen in general, but when I crave it, I really crave it. My first time here, the wait was about 1.5 hours which I didn't mind because I've heard such great things. I ordered the Daikoku ramen and was not disappointed. The broth...YUM! Service was great overall, and I left very satisfied. I knew I wanted to come back eventually. My second time, however, the wait was closer to 2 hours. My expectations were too high, and I unfortunately was extremely disappointed with the food in general. I had ordered the Daikoku ramen once again, but something about it was just off. To me, the ramen tasted like any other mediocre ramen that you can find anywhere in Los Angeles. Definitely not worth the wait. Overall, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. Definitely worth a try, but not sure what all the hype is about.",3
Overrated. Soup was warm and not hot. Pork was not good quality. Inside was hot with no air condition. Wasn't worth the wait.,3
"The ramen is really good! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait sucks though.... we ended up sitting at the bar the first time at the corner but decided to wait for a booth because of the limited space. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The guy that helps sits people with the hair and glasses was cool enough to give us the next booth that opened up. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Daikokuya Ramen is a **MUST** and the fried rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ended up getting the Combo that had the famous Ramen, Fried rice, and salad that was very well priced. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_About $13-$14 for the combo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Good location because we were Staying across the street at Miyako hotel. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I almost forgot my Hat but our kind Waiter went out of the restaurant and called me back for my hat.. She was great.Besides the line.... Great Service and great foodCASH ONLY",5
"This place always seems to have a line out the door whenever I pass by. Unfortunately, I feel that their ramen is a little over-hyped. Every time I have eaten here, the ramen broth has always been a little on the light side. And for the size bowl they give you, the amount of noodles given is somewhat lacking. The service, however, is excellent and the restaurant has a very charming ambiance that's worth experiencing. Overall, if you don't mind waiting and are content with a competent bowl of ramen in a cozy, charming restaurant then this place is perfectly fine. But if you're looking for LA's absolute best bowl of ramen, I'm not sure this is it.",3
"There are three popular ramen joints in Lil' Tokyo, this being one of the top two. I'm a local resident who only dines here when I have friends from out of town, but the hour+ wait has been worth it the past four or five times I've been. The original ramen is perfect with a side of pork belly over rice and the cold noodles dish is to die for over the summer time.If the wait is too ridiculous, try Shinsengumi or Men-Oh. Both places are equally excellent.",5
The place is all hype. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It deserves an ok but the gyoza was different and better than any gyoza i've had from other places. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The unagi with rice is good but nothing different about it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_spicy miso was not spicy and broth was just ok. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If it's a 30 minutes wait. . I would consider it but anything longer than that is not worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I cannot believe Austin has the best ramen so far . . . I guess it's time to go to japan to try the real deal.,4
"I am SOOO FULL! Got here around 5:30pm on a Friday night. The wait wasn't too bad, as there was only 3 groups ahead of us. The turn over is fast too, as it's ramen, so not too much to prepare. The soup was really good. Bold, deep, and full of fatty yumminess. The noodles were cooked perfectly, they had this nice bite to them. Good amount of bean sprouts, and green onions (practically 1/4 cup). I wish there was more bamboo shoots. The egg was cooked really well, and I appreciate how we're given a whole egg as opposed to a measly half like majority of the joints. At this point, I'm not sure which ramen spots are the best: Daikokuya, Orenchi, Santouka, Toto Ramen, or Miki. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'll definitely scratch Ippudo off my list.CASH ONLY!",4
"Whether you are visiting Little Tokyo or frequent these parts, Daikokuya is by far one of the best ramen spots in southern california. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They offer a fresh, rich broth that is unlike any other ramen house. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is exceptionally savory and I always end up going with the option of the non-watered down broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Having been multiple times, the only downside is the wait, but hey, you can expect some wait for any great restaurant!If you are craving ramen, this is definitely the place to be. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Reasonable prices+exceptional food = returning customer!",4
"We came on a friday afternoon and only waited 5 minutes. I think this place lives up to the hype. I had the daikoku kotteri and it was delicious. The broth was especially rich and creamy from the extra fat (kotteri). The pork melted in my mouth! So good. I thought the egg was a tad over cooked because I prefer a runnier yoke, but still not bad. The noodles stayed the perfect texture the whole time. Not a bad portion size for the price. I could just barely finish it all. Atmosphere is pretty authentic to me!",4
"This ramen restaurant is definitely comparable to other popular spots. I went on a weekday for lunch with a party of 3 and the wait was only a few minutes. We all ordered immediately and got our ramen within minutes! I had the Daikokuya ramen bowl which was very tasty with BOLD flavors. The egg was cooked to perfection (not overcooked and not too runny). The pork was soft, tasteful, and juicy. I loved the condiments on the table: ginger, garlic, soy sauce, seasoning, etc. I was able to make my broth flavorful and to my liking. However, although the broth is extremely packed with flavor, it is more on the salty side so I was chugging water after every few spoonfuls of ramen. Staff was attentive and service was quick on a weekday afternoon so that was wonderful.There is a parking structure across the street. Daikokuya will not validate. However, after our meal, we headed over to get mochi ice cream at Mikawaya which validated for an hour. So, parking was essentially free and I got dessert along with it. :)",4
"With over 3,700 reviews there's not much I can say or suggest that hasn't already been talked about before!We all know the wait time for a table can be ridiculously long!We all know the ramen, gyoza, and those little sausages are delicious!We all know Daikokuya is a cash only establishment!Wait!!!! I just thought of something I can suggest that probably hasn't been suggested in the 3,700+ reviews that came before me!What you do is order their thinly sliced pork belly plate, order a side of hard boiled eggs, place the egg on top of a slice of PB, top that with Sriracha (and if you're OK with being booted out of the bedroom by your significant other, add some chopped garlic), roll the sliced PB around the egg and eat that son of a bitch in one bite. What you get is a huge mouthful of fatty, salty, spicy goodness. yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_I knew if I thought hard enough I could come up with something new. If you haven't already, check out Daikokuya. Don't forget to try my pork belly wrapped hard boiled egg appetizer :)",5
"Was def good, but not the best I've had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Got the signature ramen, the portion was very large good fresh ingredients.Felt broth was bit heavy and oily didn't feel too hot after eating. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles were bit thicker &amp; bigger than I usually prefer. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Food comes out quick, good service, but wasn't blown away from the ramen of gyoza's after hearing all the hype. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, for the price you can't really beat it.Be prepared to wait at peak eating hours.",3
"This is my favorite ramen place! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is so good! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The parking is rough in little Tokyo, and there is always a waiting list to get a table, but it's worth it! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They usually get through the list pretty quickly, and the food comes out really fast, so it's not as bad as it sounds.",5
One of my favorite ramen places. It opens late. You can put your name down and have a drink at far bar while you wait. I love the spicy ramen and octopus balls!,5
"GOOD, but not worth the wait in my opinion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Used to come here more often before all the ramen shops sprung up but this was my first time back in about 4 years. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Since then the menu has evolved a bit. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They still have their mainstay Daikokuya Ramen, but they've also expanded their menu the past few years, including a spicy miso ramen.It's a great bowl of ramen with a rich pork based broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But the waits nowadays are hard to justify with so many comparable options.",4
This place is definitely worth giving a shot. The Ramen + the shredded barbecue pork was the perfect meal. The egg in the Ramen tasted so good and was cooked just right.It is hard for me to judge the best Ramen I have ever had so the whole experience plays a part. The decoration won big points with me. It made me feel as if I were in Japan eating ramen. I really liked that they all spoke japanese to one another.They were super nice and chill. This is what concluded the overall great experience. Treating costumers kindly ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and making them feel comfortable even when the restaurant is packed and line out the door makes a huge difference. I would definitely go back.,4
"We're not from the LA area, but I make it my mission each visit to try to get to Daikokuya. My family and I were lined up and waiting for the restaurant to open on a Sunday morning. My 4-year-old (who loves to count) counted 38 people in line at about 10:50 -- and this didn't include the additional people she missed or got tired of counting. And the line kept growing longer by the minute.Every time, I slurp up every last noodle and drop of soup. Their ramen seriously makes my day. Their boiled eggs are the best!! You can't beat the price either. The ramen is still under $10 and fills you up.If you have good stamina and are in good company (or have a smart phone to keep you entertained), get in that line! If you don't have time to squander, don't like counter/stool seating, have young (or fussy) children, or no cash -- this might not be the best option for you. (We were lucky enough to be seated in a booth, and I made sure my toddler had breakfast before we got in line to wait!)It's kind of fun to wait in line and observe other diners. Many were taking selfies. I was amused by the Asian woman behind me who was assuring her white boyfriend that he could get a rice bowl or something else -- I guess he didn't like ramen?!",4
"My only experience with Raman prior to this place was in the form of dried square packets and cups. Every time I made the stuff I ALWAYS burned my mouth on the damned things. So, I came here with a friend in hopes of having a non-mouth burning experience. Everything I'd heard about this place was it was crowded 7 out of 7 days, and there were always lines and loads of people there. Well, today there was a small crowd outside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I pushed my way through the cloth-curtain thing in front of the door, and then walked in the front door, to put my name on the list. As I glanced at the list, I noticed that there were only 5 or 6 boxes that hadn't been scratched out. Extra bonus, the person who wrote her name on the list ahead of me gave up on the place and walked away. So with hope in a short wait, I went out to talk with my companion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ After some conversation, we moved inside to wait. It's not a big place, and people are stuffed wall-to-wall. We felt we could hear them call our name easier from there. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After a five-to-ten or so minute wait, the Asian guy screamed out my name, and gestured to two open seats at the ""bar"" type area. I picked up the menus and handed one to my friend, who took it and we began to flip through it. We had had an opportunity to peruse the menu quickly while waiting for the name calling. I figured their specialty was a good place to start. So I went with the raman specialty bowl. My lunch friend Gloria ordered the Chicken Teri Bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We looked around and observed people to figure out how to eat the things that were going to be delivered to us.  ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Waitress came over and placed a pair of those slurpee-spoon things in front of us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Gloria's Teri bowl apparently had a soup and salad portion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Which she graciously let me try. They were quite tasty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My Raman bowl arrived as her Teri bowl did. I fiddled with chopsticks for a bit, but I fear I may have hit Gloria with noodle or sauce, as she politely asked the waitress to get me a fork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I didn't feel so bad about as I saw a family sitting on the other side of the bar eating with forks. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The Raman was far superior to anything I had made on my own. The noodles were soft, the broth was good. There was even a weird lookin egg in it. It was an odd brown color. Gloria suggested it was a duck egg. I tried it and it was OK. As I read the menu, it's a marinated boiled egg. I shared Raman with Gloria, and she shared Chicken Teri with me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Both were good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Neither of us could finish our massive servings before us, and we flew the flag of defeat and asked for the check. Two bowls with tax and tip were about twenty bucks. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not bad at all. Thankfully, I had a $20 in my wallet to pay for it, as this place only takes cash. Their menu was reasonably priced, and had a multitude of things I'd like to go back and try. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ All in all I thought the place was a solid okay. The wait, &amp; cash only factors each took off a star in my eyes. If I'm ever back in that area, I'll give it a shot again, depending upon the size of the mob in front of the place. It was pretty good, but certainly not good enough for an hour wait.",3
"No doubt already that the ramen is delish. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So creamy and flavorful a broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just learned that you can request a half size, but pssh - ORDER AS IS, people. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Enjoy the large ramen and accompanying appetizers. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You waited at least half an hour, if not a full hour, didn't you? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Waiting so long makes me always want to order the ramen because who waits in line forever and doesn't order the house specialty, but I've heard the rest of the menu is yummy too. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'll be eager to return.5 fun stars for the service. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was set to bring in a boba drink from a different establishment, then spilled it all over the front step of Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The host said ""Aw it's all good! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We got this. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Don't worry. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just go on in."" ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Don't forget: CASH ONLY.",4
"I am so very sorry my friends for adding to the hype, but something spectacular happened here. I cannot consider myself totally versed in the ramen ways, but I've had my fair share of the SoCal variety.They ain't kidding. The worse part about this place is the wait. On a Thursday night and near closing, there was a 30 minute wait with 5 groups ahead of us. The rules for late night dining is that as long as you sign in before closing time, you will still be seated. I overheard that from a girl working there.-=-Ramen Kotteri + fried rice combo-=- Ordering ramen here is pretty straight forward. This is the single dish that most people order here. You may elect to get it koteri, which adds an extra pool of fatty pork juice (back fat just doesn't sound appealing, but it's goooooooood). The flavor difference is slight but if you want the satisfaction of knowing you got all the ramen flavor you could get, this is the way to do it. The fried rice was pretty heavenly...maybe even more flavorful than the ramen was. I would not come here without ordering the fried rice EVER. Mark those words my friends.yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_",5
"Daikokuya is as good as it gets. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I love their traditional style ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their pork broth is the most savory amazing broth I have ever had...ever and I have had alot of ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles are always perfect, broth is always perfect, the egg is always perfect. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Love the hole in the wall vibe and the servers are cool. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's the only ramen spot I will wait 30+ minutes in line for. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I love taking people here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_FYI, cash only and no take out!",5
"Daikokuya always have problem with they can't maintain same taste across different locations (Sawtelle is the worst so far I have tried) even at this location in Little Tokyo I could tell since 2012 that it doesn't taste as good as before like when I was their customer back in 2002-2008 but it was still acceptable for me, but now their foods at this original location are going downhill to the point that I think the management team should had resigned. Almost everything from salad dressing, donburi, spicy tuna tempura, ramen broth, chashu, eggs.. are really different from before (changes are good too if it's for improvement to be better, but not getting worse like than before like this), I guess that the owner and the management team are not bothering to work hard to fix this problem (that has been going for many years already) at all, because Daikokuya is too famous now. So why bother? When the sales still good and the waiting line still long.. that's probably what they are thinking right now.",2
"(Vegetarian review) So, this is the second time I come here. First time was so disappointing, I said to myself: ""This place has all the buzz, and my experience was so disappointing? This can't be right."" So I gave it a second chance and i'm glad I did.The good:The place is super cool looking, good service, nice staff. We start by ordering some hot sake. It's not that bad for the price, and the quality was pretty decent. Then the avocado rolls come: delicious as usual. Then the tempura vegetables: also quite good and filling. The bad:My last experience was with a very very mediocre Yakisoba. Everything is really expensive and most of the items are really overpriced. The wait to be seated can go up to an hour. Which can really be upsetting if you are hungry and have to wait for that amount of time. Maybe this is not the place to go if you are a vegetarian but at least they're dishes you can have.",4
"Yesterday was my gf and i anniversary so we went on a food adventure/DineLA the entire day LOLOl n this place was our dinner!! When we went there it was around 5:30pm so there was just one table ahead of us! SWEET!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We quickly brought to a table and start looking at their awesome menu!!We ordered 2 tonkotsu ramen, fried rice (full portion), and takoyaki! So after that they brought us salad and miso soup. I've been here many time n i've never notice how good there salad was until this time!! omg... it was so good and it tasted like they put some of the soup base into the salad dressing when were making the it!! Because for some reason i can taste the soup base when i was eating the salad! nice!!~ Ramen: last time i was here i think it was last year summer! good thing i'm back cuz their ramen is #1 on my ramen list. Everything was just perfect in the bowl... the noodle (firm), the soup was super rich and not salty! (i drink that soup like crazy!) and the chashu was thin but tasted incredible (not like the chashu from other place that taste like its been there for a long time). As for the Ajitsuke tamago (marinated egg) HOLY MOTHER OF CHEWIE BALLZ!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Hands down the best Ajitsuke tamago ive every had (Monta ramen in Vegas has the similar taste of ajitsuke). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My gf actually like Monta ramen (in Las Vegas) better then this place. Hey cant blame her cuz that place is sharing the #1 spot on my Best ramen list. Yeah Monta was THAT GOOD.~ Fried Rice: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Man i don't know what they put in the fried rice but wow it was the best fried rice i've ever had from a ramen place (compare to all the ramen place in LA/OC.). However thou.. Monta actually have fried rice that's better than here!! Mind blowing good!!! If you guys are going make sure u put their garlic sauce on top of the fried rice omg it's like the best thing ever!!! actually put the garlic sauce anywhere!! Ramen, fried rice, salad! lolol~ Takoyaki: The takoyaki was good but not like wowowo good. The takoyaki pieces was little be smaller then the one i usually get from this japanese event at the Mitsuwa market place. But still good!!Park at the meter! Bring cash!' CASH ONLY here!!Taste: 4.8Presentation: 4.0Service: 4Price: 4.5~~Chewie Rating: 4.33 Oishii thumbs up!!!Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_Ãƒ_Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_Ã‚Â¨Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_Ã‚Â©Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€__Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_ÃƒÃ…Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€__Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_ÃƒÂ¸Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_Ã‚Â¬Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€__Ã¢â‚¬_ÃƒÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢ÃƒÂ¨Ãƒ_ÃƒÂ¸Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€__Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_ÃƒÅ“Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_ÃƒÂ¨Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_Ã‚Â»Ã¢â‚¬_ÃƒÂ¢_Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€__Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬_Ãƒâ€_Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢_Ãƒâ€_",5
Great Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Long Wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But it's a must try LA spot.,3
"After waiting over one and half hour, it paid off with the original ramen soup, the taste is amazing",5
"TIP: come right when it opens for lunch or come at around 630pm for dinner or prepare for long waits outside.rich kotteri broth is very fatty but very rich and flavorful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For a popular place with thousands of reviews, it's actually not overpriced and has value because they put quite a bit of noodles and meat in there.",4
"Good place to get your rain fix. Unfotunately, I am not a big fan so I rather have some thing else. The prices are pretty reasonable as well.",4
"The broth in the ramen, is the best! My boyfriend and I both ordered the house special. We came in around three in the afternoon and it was pretty busy, although luckily we didn't have to wait long to be seated. The portion size was decent, good amount of noodles, enough sides, and the broth..the broth was amazing! Definitely recommend others to check this restaurant if you happen to be in Little Toyko:)",4
"The ramen is legit...it's good for both Japanese visitors expecting a creamy, flavorful broth in LA, and for people who like quality ingredients, but don't want to wander too far to find it. I gave it an extra star because it's located, right in the heart of Little Tokyo and whenever there's a festival on the strip, you really feel like you're in Japan. If you take away the wait, and so so parking situation, then maybe I'd give it another star, but no ramen place in LA is worth a 30+ minute wait because that's how long it takes to get seated at the next AWESOME ramen place!",3
"Go here on weekday afternoon. Less lines than usual. I got myself a real Top Ramen from scratch. Add kotteri which enhances the flavor of the soup.5/5 Tonkotsu is perfect in soup.Good flavor, meat is tender and melt in your mouth, egg is perfectly cooked, noodles are cooked perfect, and I gave it a try with garlic to give it a garlicky taste. Overall, its perfect coming again sometime.Service:OK and waiter(ess) are good service.Remember cash only. Located in Little Tokyo/Arts District.",5
"I love getting the daikoku ramen over the spicy miso ramen and when I do, I always have to get the combo with the fried rice. It is bomb :)_",5
"I came on a thursday night at 10:30 pm hoping I would be able to walk in and that was NOT THE CASE :( It was worth the wait though.My food partner thought that this place is better than orenchi. There's something about the spicy broth that can't be attained by other ramen houses. I really liked my broth too but as a non-spicy eater.... I think the spicy broth was much more delicious. It's worth all the tears, sweat and burning sensation.I finished at 11:00 pm and there was a short wait-list still... you know this place is good when people are waiting to eat this late on a weeknight!",5
"Ramen is not my go to food but having tried a couple other ramen houses, daikokuya is the best. All of their broths are super flavorful. If you are not a big fan of ramen, order the pork belly bowl. It is super delicious! Overall, hour wait aside, I am so happy I finally got to eat here! If you are a foodie, this place is a must try.",5
"Best Ramen in LA.So authentic, quick service, piping hot. Get the extra pork fat for a hearty, savory tonkotsu. I think about it all the time and have tried to find an equivalent in a more convenient spot but haven't been able to. Also, so reasonably priced - so much food for $12.There seemed to be a long wait but since there were two of us we were seated quickly at the bar, which somehow ended up adding to the authentic feel of the experience.",5
"I love the ramen here. The broth, meat and noodles of the Daikoku ramen are always top quality and filling. I can never finish a bowl because the portion is huge (darn shame!).The salad is soooo good! It's a bit like coleslaw, but less watery.It gets pretty crowded at the place and you might have to wait in line to get a seat. I arrived before the restaurant opened and there already were people waiting outside.Service was pretty good. No complaints there.Other than waiting, the cons are it's cash only and you can't order to go. You can get a container if you eat in and have leftovers.",4
"The wait is worth it. One of the best ramen I've had in Cali. Ask for the extra pork fat in the soup base and wow, explosion of flavors. Chasu is great, bamboo flavorful. Everything had a good balance. I took some relatives visiting from the northwest and they were impressed. After waiting 40 mins, my relatives were all smiles and said they were happy they stayed patiently to try this place. There is a reason why this place is so highly reviewed.",5
"First time I've been to Daikokuya! Came here on a Tuesday evening after work and it was pretty crowded for a Tuessday. Waited for about 30 minutes for a party of 3 people, but after we were seated the service moved pretty quickly. If you want a bang for your buck, you have to order the combinations! The combination includes a big bowl of ramen (you can upgrade to cold, spicy miso broth, or tsukemen ramen) and you can choose between differently-priced rice bowls. I got the pork cutlet rice bowl (fried pork cutlet fried in egg omg) and tried my friend's salmon sashimi rice. I would say avoid the sashimi rice bowls and go for the lesser-priced ones, it will be more worth it!The ramen was really delicious but I do think I like Shin-Sen Gumi's broth better. Definitely would come here again though!",4
"I heard this place gets packed on weekends, I went on a Wednesday and it wasn't that packed. it's a small restaurant and the booths are pretty tiny. I was in a party of 5 and we were a little squished but it wasn't that bad. the service was kind of iffy. the food was delicious though. I believe I got a pork bowl or something along the lines of that. it was delicious. I also had the spicy miso ramen. the broth was good and the noodles were yummy too. definitely a good place to grab a bite. loved the decorations and the old Japanese music played.",4
"I still go back there after 15 years. Cash only. Don't try to go fancy, just dive in their namesake Ramen (""Daikokuya Ramen"") and enjoy. Best to go solo, so you can snag one of the single spots at the counter and bypass the throngs of ppl waiting for one of the contested tables...",5
Came here for the second time and tried the kotteri version ( with backbone fat?) and I think both versions are good. I didn't notice a considerable difference so in the future I will stick to the regular broth as to keep my cholesterol down. Came at 6ish on a Friday and there was no line! O_____o Gah!,5
"I think this place lived up to its hype. Pork was tender, broth was flavorful, and the egg was cooked just enough to remain yolky on the inside.. I hit a huge dilemma picking between the original and spicy miso broth...so my fatass picked both. The original broth was really good, but the spicy miso stole my heart. Another reason why I love this place is the jar of garlic on the side. The only down side I can think of is the wait.if you have the patience, come here! if not, go ahead and go to shin sen gumi",4
"The line for this place was insane, but it was worth the wait. The ramen is delicious and served very fast. The service is great as they are trying to make everything as fast as possible due to the long line, however, the quality of the food is not compromised. I recommend coming in a small group as couples were sat the fastest at whatever random open seats they had.",4
"Man, I love the food, but the restrooms are atrocious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Definitely some health code concerns. Also around the counter seating, you can see how it really isn't kept clean. Please, clean your restaurant up and I will be back.",1
"I'm not sure I understand what the hype is about. Maybe I didn't order right? The ramen I had was def. not wait in line-worthy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was luke warm. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The piece of pork in the soup was very fatty and sinewy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I don't think this is as good as it gets as far as ramen goes! I felt fine after I ate it--but, felt so sick about 2 hours later. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The decor of the place is really nice--it has a Japan circa the 50's feel--that I really enjoyed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Other than that....I can't think of much else positive to say. They have an annoying ""Cash only"" policy--which is fine, that's their business to do that--but, it is a hassle for customers! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Also, I would recommend that they put a slice of lemon in their ice water as the tap water just tastes wrong.",2
"Yeah! Best ramen I've ever had. The wait can be long, but it's well worth it (and I've seen short wait times too, even at dinnertime). I like the Daikoku Ramen with kotteri broth and hot sake. The broth is cooked for a full day and uses some kind of super tasty, super tender pork. The kotteri option is a bit thicker than normal and has more pork fat. The atmosphere is wonderfully loud and chaotic and the price is dirt cheap for what you get. Service is always friendly and attentive.",4
"Review in #Haiku:Local landmark jointRamen, beer, old school musicStill not worth the wait",3
"Lets start with how ridiculous the wait is. Came here for the first time and waited about a little past 2 hours! I was excited about trying this place but after waiting so long your experience kind of goes down a notch. But you can't really be upset the place is not large to begin with and so many people want to eat here.Now, the service is absolutely great. The waiters/waitresses are so friendly and though they're busy they are still attentive to the customers needs. The food now, I ordered the traditional ramen with a side of sashimi and rice. Also With your order comes a salad that is sooooo delicious! And they even sale their house dressing so I snagged one up. I would come back here for the fried rice, hands down the best I have ever had. The ramen was also good, the meat is very tender. And one can not complain about the amount you are served it's soooo much you will definitely get food coma after.",4
"Had to try it when I was in town last week since it has so many reviews! Overall I think its good ramen. I got the daikokuya ramen and the broth tasted good. Did feel like there was too much noodles and too little of the other ingredients. The takoyaki I thought was not that good.Although not the best ramen I've had in the US, this is still pretty decent.",3
"It was a hot, hot day in Little Tokyo... I walked into Daikokuya and it was even hotter inside! Why did we decide to eat ramen at this time?! I thought to myself, ""This ramen better be hella good..."" and was it? YES! It was AMAZING. Worth all the uncomfortable heat and sweat!This was only my second time trying ramen at a restaurant and it was awesome! I've really been missing out! Or maybe it's just Daikokuya's ramen :) We were seated after waiting only 20 minutes at most (but we were there around 3~4pm) We both ordered their specialty, the Daikoku ramen, one as a combo with a Chicken Teriyaki bowl to share. The food came out pretty fast and OMG the bowl is HUGE! I'm pretty sure I stared at it for a few minutes wondering if I could even finish it. Once I started eating, I understood why this is one of the top places in LA. The noodles tasted so fresh and the broth was super flavorful. From what I remember, it came with chasu pork slices, a boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and tons of green onions. Everything was delicious - ESPECIALLY the egg. I've never had an egg cooked like that before! The chicken teriyaki bowl was also yummy but not as memorable as the ramen. I got sooo full and had to try super hard to finish as much of it as possible since it was so good!If you're anywhere near Daikokuya or ever want to try real ramen, I definitely suggest eating here. It's worth the wait, the price, and the heat! :)",5
I don't know what the hype is about here. A friend and I went here and we were both pretty disappointed. I don't remember the types of ramen we got but we left unhappy about the food we had.,3
"Great ramen. Grey little place, quick service once you're in the door. Two hour wait outside while homeless men kept asking for money though- downside to the place.",4
"Kotteri Daikoku Ramen VS. Regular Daikoku RamenKotteri is the clear WINNER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Kotteri Daikoku Ramen (5 of 5) - A good broth is so important to a good ramen. In this comparison, I could clearly taste the kotteri texture and the taste truly extended the ramen's potential. Simply having the kotteri to the ramen broth, made it taste so much richer and fattier and flavorful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_* Regular Daikoku Ramen (3 of 5) - The broth was a lot clearer and lacked texture. When eating it with the noodle, it tasted more bland and I truly regretted not ordering TWO kotteri daikoku ramens. * add on fried rice to the ramen $11.50 (3.5 of 5) - My fried rice was tasty, but a little too watery in the rice department. If it was a little drier, than I wouldn't feel like it was so soggy.* add on shredded pork bowl to the ramen $11.95 (4 of 5) - Melt in your mouth shredded pork goodness. Delicious texture and beautiful piece of pulled pork. Too bad the sauce covering it was too sweet and too salty for my taste even with the complimenting rice. None the less, it was beautiful piece of pork shred. Pretty yummy ramen house in LA. Really quite decor and old japanese poster ads at this location. Apparently, there are many locations. I wouldn't mind visiting other locations next time in LA. However, no more regular daikoku ramen for me. Only KOTTERI DAIKOKU RAMEN is the way to go!",4
"I don't know if I can write anything that anybody else hasn't mentioned yet. But I'll have to say that in the friendly battle of the two largest cities in America, New York takes the prize for having better ramen.Don't get me wrong. The broth is great, the noodles are awesome, and the pork melts in your mouth. It's just hat everything in New York just does those things slightly better AND most of the locations have amazing pork buns as well. However, Daikokuya will be easier on your wallet.One piece of advice: if you plan on getting the broth with extra fat (kotteri) be prepared to feel it. It does make the broth more flavorful, but it also weighs heavily in your stomach. I'm not saying that this is necessarily a bad thing, unless you plan on going for a run after the meal.",4
"Best ramen ever! I've been to Japan and it isn't the same, but it's definitely as close as it's going to get in California! An easy to miss shop, if not for the hour long wait. (tip: weeknights are less crowded &amp; the bar has a shorter wait time). Tried their special hot soup ramen &amp; sashimi salmon appetizer dish. Service was extremely fast. We sat, ordered, and got our food within 10-15mins; though granted, we did already know what we wanted to order before we were seated. The salmon sashimi itself came in seven large slices. It wasn't the freshest it could be, but to be fair, it was late (9:30PM approx). The ramen itself was good; my favorite part had to be the egg, which was fully cooked, but left a little bit gooey on the inside. The soup blended well with the noodles. Although, if you loooove garlic, I'd recommended adding the garlic sauce they have on the side. It makes the whole thing much better. I do appreciate that they give you the option of adding garlic since everyone has different opinions. I already have cravings after my first time eating and it's only been two days: 5/5.",5
"The last time I went to Daikokuya was 2 years ago and maybe some things have changed (for the better) and maybe it's stayed the same but based on my review, I don't think i'll be giving this place another try. The staff was friendly, I'll give em that but the food was sub-par at best. Super greasy (not tasty) ramen, the texture of the noodle was terrible, too chewy and the taste of the broth was off. The only thing I might order again is the fried rice but I'm a Pescetarian now so oh well. Bummed I had to wait almost an hour for food that wasn't that good but what can ya do?",2
"Still enjoyed this place although it was a super hot day and ramen was not the best idea but because of such great yelp reviews, drove 45 minutes to LA just to try this place. Place was a little small and although many of the staff saw us walk in, they didn't bother to greet us only were we seated did they present any kind of customer service. I got myself the ramen special which turned out to be huge. I'm amazed I almost finished it. Major food coma after that. I'm just glad there were places to walk around to after. Overall this place was great. One of the best serving size for their price. I'll come back again during the winter time when it's a bit colder outside!",4
We waited for an hour at this place. It is a small table with limited tables. The food is really good. I specially liked the spicy pork bowl. Also tried the spicy miso soup. I would definitely recommend the spicy pork bowl.,4
"Oh, so good! Their Daikokuya ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ramen is so delicious!It is miso, and they have hot dogs, comes in 5 pieces.And you can buy the salad dressing home, cost $6.00, it's so good!!!!!!!!! They will make the food quick, just wait like about 10 minutes , next time, when I'm in little Tokyo , I just need to eat here!",5
"This is one LA food finds in Little Tokyo that requires CASH. Fortunately CHASE any CITI are across the street from here. Plan to get your name on the list before you go the the ATM. If you're hungry now... You will be well starved by the time you get your table, so be sure you get your name on the list before you get hungry, it will be worth the wait. By the way the salad dressing was awesome, so we grabbed one for $6!",4
"I would never understand people's fascination with Daikokuya. I met up for Ramen with a friend at this location one Tuesday. When we arrived, there was already a bit of a wait (about 15-20 minutes at 6pm). I ordered their special tonkatsu ramen. It was okay at best. I've had way better Ramen with way less wait.Parking situation: there is no parking! We parked across the street at the Little Tokyo Market Place. No validation, so be ready to pay. Cash only. We didn't know until we saw handwritten signs inside. I'm a little biased against cash only restaurants because really, who still brings cash? Luckily, there was a Chase across the street.The place was pretty small, hence the long wait. When we finished our meal and went outside, the line was unbelievable. People were lining out in the streets. Is it worth it? I really don't think so.I feel like Daikokuya is one of those places famous just because it has a following. Sort of reminds me of the Boiling Crab. Probably wouldn't come back again.",3
This is the best ramen I've had in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Be prepared to wait for a table.Definitely get the Koterri ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Will come back!,4
"Unfuckingbelievably delicious. I wondered in here after drinks with a few friends, we were... Drunk. We proceeded to order, I got the pork bowl. It was magical. Everything in that bowl makes your mouth ecstatic! From the beautiful sweet pork that melts in your mouth to the fluffy perfect bed of rice that everything rests on. There's a little bunch of fresh green onions sat atop it all that adds a wonderful earthy bright flavor along with pink pickled onions! Omg the pickled onions! They are tart and delicious and add a wonderful balance.We left, happy, contented and on our way to a hangover the next day. A few weeks later when I absolutely had to have that pork bowl again no one could remember where this place was or what it was called. We couldn't remember how we had stumbled across it. I dragged my boyfriend on a mission to discover it again. No luck. It became a mildly burning obsession. It had the far away and unattainable promise and splendor of Oz, Narnia, a mystical place I could not find my way back to. The search became a distant and regretful memory for I and the four souls with me on that fateful night.... Until!!!! I got a call from a friend... She had found it... It was on... We were there that night, raising celebratory golden beers in a toast of triumph!",5
While visiting Little Tokyo we saw a line forming in front of this place even before it opened. We were hungry and decided to get in line. The food was tasty and the staff friendly. The restaurant was a little hot and stuffy. But it gave it an authentic feel. I recommend.,4
"This place serves, by far, the best ramen I ever had. Whenever I am getting a craving for ramen, this place is my go-to.",5
"wait two hours? I've done that. It's not exactly worth that wait, but it's the closet thing to being worth that wait in Los Angeles. It's just the best. Daikokuya is the only place I'd wait an hour for happily. Follow the crowd.",4
"Ok so not the best ramen, I've ever had but still worth the wait. Place is small but tables and bar turn fast. I thought the broth was the best part. The noodles are better at Kitakata. If you are in Little Tokyo, get your name on the list and walk across the street to check out the shops and other eats.",4
I've been looking for a good ramen place and I found it so yummy and so worth the 30 min wait time. Service is great people are friendly and on top of it when it comes to filling up your drinks taking trash away or extra plates that you don't need. I loved it my first time here and I know it's not my last the food it self was soooo good. Best part is the price good price for good amount of food. Totally worth it,5
"PROS: One of the best ramen places i've been to. The broth is incredibly flavorful and has just the right amount of seasoning. Bowl is served nice and hot (not lukewarm) Portions are generous. Ingredients are fresh and of high quality. CONS: Since this place is so delicious, a lot of people seem to gravitate to eat here rather than other places around the area. As a result, 95% of the time there's a waiting line. The wait isn't too too bad because most people end up leaving thinking that it'll be too long before they eat - So just have a bit of patience and I assure you WON'T be disappointed but only satisfied! Overall, the taste/flavors of this place are LEGIT and it's not just hype.",4
The food is really good here and the portion is really big for 1 person. I came here with my cousin and the place is really small. We were seated at the bar. I didn't have much space to move and the bar was a kind of hot it was pretty much in front of where the chefs were cooking. There is street parking.,3
"Yep, totally worth wait.... and oh, I have waited. But here is the plan, write your name down, and grab a drink down the street or some mochi in the plaza. Check in every 20 minutes or so until there are a couple 2 tops in front of you.... Or take yourself to the Monterrey Park and wait zero to 15 minutes for a seat. The menu is slightly different but the all the staples are present. The whole menu is crazy good. One of my most favorite restaurants in LA. Anytime, anyone comes to visit me I make sure I take them to Daikokuya.",5
Overrated. Not worth the wait. Poor service. Poor food quality. However always enjoy going to different places.,2
"This is the second time I have been back and I didn't think it could be possible but this place only gets better! It is a walk-in only jawn (and they will only seat you if your full party is here), expect a wait.Their regular ramen is sooooo legit, fatty broth, plenty of slurpy noodles and delicious meat, with the perfectly boiled egg with an uncooked yolk. You have the option to pay $15 for a combo with a small meat/ fish bowl with your ramen.This time I decided to go large, ordered the over priced teriyaki eel rice bowl. It was almost $17 but totally worth the price!! It came with plenty of eel, sauce and rice I packed another whole meal for lunch the next day to go. The eel comes steamy, warm, and perfectly melts in your mouth with the perfect amount of fish and skin. I have found the perfect eel rice!!!!The chicken teriyaki that came with the combo was so so, there was kinda a lot of fat, more than meat and the sauce made all the rice all soggy. But I'll keep coming back for my favorite eel in LA hands down!!!!! Oh, just remember it is cash only.",5
"If your not from LA, this is the place to go!! It's amazing. Just know, that the waiting time is about 1-2hrs depending on the day. It's worth it.",5
Don't really understand the hype. The wait it long and the place is super tiny. What kind of threw me off was we had 5 in the group and we wanted to sit in a booth that was small but we had three very petite gals so it was ok and then we got told that we can't add people to our party because one person came late. The customer service was just not acceptable. As far as the food..... The ramen was good but not amazing and I've had better. I got the combo with the pork cutlet and the sauce on the pork and egg mix was so sweet I didn't eat it. My friends had the fried rice and that was good. Overall nothing to write home about and I will take my business elsewhere in j town for better ramen like orochon,3
"I drive from West Covina and Ontario for their ramen, I love it! The lines can get long and they won't seat you till your all there, longest I think I waited was almost 2 hours, but it was worth the wait.",5
Worth the wait! Go go go ramen is delicious you won't be disappointed. Don't go here if your starving because you will have to wait. We waited like 35 min to get sat for a party of two which was not bad at all. I got the daikoku ramen kotteri style and it was to die for.,5
"I wanted to add that I've been to a few other ramen places now since I last wrote my review and Daikokuya is still my #1!By rank, faaaaaar better than Iroha, Rokuan, Yukino-Ya, Orenchi, Santouka, Foo-Foo-Tei, other Daikokuya locations, Totto Ramen NY, Ippudo NY, Orochan (I love spicy, but their ramen is yuck!), Shinsengumi, Ajisen (why is this junk even considered ramen?), and a few others I've tried at the Ramen Yokocho festivals which I'm not ranking. They now have salmon sashimi bowls which I have to say I enjoy even more than the tuna sashimi bowls! I might dare to have a real serving of their spicy miso ramen someday, but I can never resist getting my tried and true tonkotsu! So much so I never even bother to get the tsukumen no matter how hot it is outside.And their hours! I must proclaim how much I love their hours! Most other small ramen shops close between lunch and dinner or on random days you wouldn't expect them to be closed (like why Tuesday?). There may be a line, but I can always count on Daikokuya to be open and ready to satisfy my ramen cravings.Little Tokyo Daikokuya, why can't you share your magic with your other locations? Either way, you're still the best. I can't wait to come home and have some again.",5
"Long waiting line. Rush service and the food wasn't really good and worth 1hours waiting. I packed the rest home and the fat and oil from my food came out so I can see how much fat did I take. Feel like the food has plain taste and all fried with oil, a lot of oil",1
"Noodle is way too salty for my taste, but still not bad.",2
"I will wait forever for that small bowl of ""shredded pork"" that comes aside my delicious bowl of ramen.. Maybe I should just order that by itself, but it would feel wrong not to get ramen here.The wait is long, but always seems to be worth it once you get seated. Service is great and they handle the crowd well.There are so many reviews, so I'll just leave it with: I will be back again and again.",5
"The fiance and I usually try to go to Orochan every time we're in LA. Heard about this place and decided to change it up. We got sat down pretty much on arrival and didn't have to wait. We got the spicy miso ramen and honestly, it was good. I'm not sure that I would've waited 45 minutes to an hour but the broth is great and noodles are tasty. My only real knock on this place was that they don't really make the ramen spicy. You can get a chili oil but it gives the ramen a very sesame oil style taste. If you want something spicy, I'd recommend going elsewhere.",4
"High expectations lead to higher disappointment, such is the lesson I learned from Daikokuya. After comparison, I would rather go out of my way from L.A. to City of Industry for FOO FOO TEI to satisfy my noodle cravings, than eat here again. First, it's the waiting - a small party of 2 - we waited for 15+ minutes, at 2:00 p.m. on a Tuesday. Since the wait was within expectation after reading the reviews, let's move on to the food. $8.95 for a Daikokuya ramen and a spicy miso ramen for the other half (9.95). Price was fairly reasonable, but the service and quality of food did not measure up. The reviews prepped me for the service, but not of this kind. I expected older ladies in their 50's working, not 20-30 yo's busing tables at speeds of .001 mph. After watching them clean off the table (putting remnants of foods and napkins into half consumed water cups) I started wavering about my choice in coming to this restaurant.Upon receiving the food, I was confirmed of my suspicions. The bowl felt greasy - like it has not been cleaned well. Even the water cup smelt of lysol. The noodle? The texture of the noodle was not as soft, but very tough, unexpected. The meat was average. The egg yolk had a dim, translucent look that told me it was not fully cooked. The bowl seemed to have cooled down before I even finished the meal - and that was within 15 minutes. After eating, hubby and I both felt sick.In conclusion - I will not be coming here again. FOO FOO TEI has older ladies busing tables at the speed of light, with ramen that taste like heaven, and prices that's too good to be true (7.50 -12.00). I'd rather spend that extra $4.00 in gas than to have sub-par ramen which will give me diarrhea the next day.It's popularity? I can't fathom. Perhaps this is primarily for those who haven't had a chance to get some proper ramen, for those that don't mind frou-frou ramen with natural laxative enzymes in aiding weight loss. For me, it's hasta la vista, and never again in mi vida.",2
"I loved daikokuya.. I went there on a tuesday afternoon at 2pm but they still were kind of crowded, i waited for 20 minutes to be seated.. Get the Original ramen with kotteri soup, it is bomb. I have eaten at many ramen places, but for daikokuya it's the subtle differences which made it better than all its competitors. The ramen is cooked and placed in the broth at the prefect temperature, making it a pleasurable experience every time you slurp the noodles. Remember to eat it fast, and probably don't allow it to cool down, After it cool's down it tastes like all the other ramen out there. I could only eat 1/3 of the ramen and took the rest to go. ONLY CASH accepted here. Loved the Gyoza and the fried rice too. They were the bomb too!!.",5
"Imma keep it short and simple for this one cause words cant describe how AMAZING it is...you just gotta try it yourself/long wait...dont go if youre SUPER hungryget the richer tonkatsu broth, TRUST me...its richer in flavor but still light on the stomach...if you ever had heaven's water...imagine it pork flavor and you have thisramen is very boing-y....but i wasnt a fan of their bamboo shootbig bowl...you'll come out happy",5
"If you just want good ramen then you should go here but I have to warn you it is going to be very hot inside. I think it was hotter inside than outside today especially when you sit at the bar. You sweat a lot because you're sitting next to the soup pots and also eating hot ramen. They also have only this small ceiling fan and they leave the door open which sometimes makes it worse. The place is fairly small but people eat relatively quickly! Probably because it's so hot in there and they're dying from the heat! If you don't like green onions be sure to let them know because they put A LOT of green onions on top of the ramen! @.@Tsukumen - cold noodles with everything separated but broth is still hot Spicy miso ramen - good but not very spicy, you can always add chili flakes into it to make it more spicy Daikoku ramen - similar to spicy miso but not spicyFried Spicy Tuna - not very good, looks like tempura. They put spicy tuna wrapped with something and then fry it - not recommended The only thing about the ramen is that the meat is very fatty so if you don't like that then this might not be for you.",3
"This place is really good, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ But there is almost always a wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ I'm not a big noodle fan, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_but I would continuously eat at this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ I recommend.",4
"I'm a Ramen expert by no stretch of the imagination. I've tried it before a couple times but I'm still trying to figure it out. I will say this, if every Ramen place was as good as this one, I'm all in.I got the basic spicy ramen bowl and it was good. It was definitely spicy but not overwhelming. If I was the type to not eat spicy, it would definitely be overwhelming. The portion of meat in it was a bit light but the broth was rich and flavorful.We also order dumplings as an appetizer and that was a huge hit for the whole table. The service was good, the prices were fair, the wait wasn't bad. I'd recommend it.",4
"I used to think this place was the ish until I tried other ramen joints out there. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But hey, don't be discouraged, Daikokuya earned its star in the ramen hall of fame for a reason:Food:-Ramen- 3.5 stars: It's good but not great, they do their egg really well I'll give them that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But I don't go to Daikokuya for their ramen, I got for their...-Pork Bowl- 5 flippin stars; this dish is amazing!!! Their pork is tender and juicy, I could eat this dish alllll day long!*There's always a wait here, I really recommend checking this place out on a weekday, and no matter what you do, do NOT skip out on the pork bowl!!",4
"I've heard about this place for a long time and i've always wanted to come here. My friend and I came here at around 1:00 on a wednesday, and we surprisingly only had to wait for 5 or so minutes.The Daikokuya ramen was really good, but I have had better tonkotsu ramen elsewhere. I think next time I come here I'll definitely have to try the fatty version of the soup (though it kind of scares me that they add extra fat to make it tastier).My friend also ordered the potstickers and fried rice. The potstickers were strange, as they were all connected to each other via one long fried piece of dough. However, they were good, and not too heavy.",4
"The most delicious ramen ever! The broth is so delicious and flavored. The meat is so soft, it melts in your mouth. The amount of veggies and noodles with broth is awesome. I love going here with my boyfriend! A must try for those in Lil Tokyo.The only down side is the waiting, but it goes by fast. I also wish the place is bigger~ it would be nicer.",5
This place was kind of cramped and humid. We didn't wait for a long time but it is because we went early on Friday. I had the spicy miso and it was delicious. Comparing to orochan ramen the broth was less saltier and more flavorful. The chashu pork really did melt in your mouth. Only reason i give this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because the noodles were not as well fried as orochans but still great. Highly recommend for ramen lovers.,4
"Ok - I am not a ramen expert at all. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_In truth I don't really consider ramen as a meal worthy of writing about. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But I saw the line here last night and was curious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Well, I'm sold on this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I just had the standard ramen bowl and the broth is delicious!",4
"Amazing Ramen! I highly recommend the Spicy Miso Ramen. It was so flavorful and the perfect amount of spicy. I also really loved the soft boiled egg in it. There was a long wait going into 10 pm, but it was well worth it. This was the busiest place on the block so get there early! Also, if you don't finish it, ask for it to go and they will give you a brand new one so your noodles and vegetables aren't gross the next day. It's like 2 meals for 1! Great service too! And you can't beat the location when it's so close to the Arts District!",5
"Since I found the less-clusterfy location in Arcadia, I haven't been back to the original restaurant in Little Tokyo. But a friend was visiting from out of town, so we decided to have her experience the REAL THING.Kotteri broth, as always, freaking savory and delicious. So thick and heavy and nom, amazing.Main reason for updating my review - I want to remember and share that they go through about 20 parties per hour! (Makes sense, assuming each group takes ~30 minutes to eat, and they have seating for about 10 parties inside.) We put our names down (they were calling number 10, we were number 30) at around 11:50am and sat at 1pm.",5
"Bruh it sucks here. We came in asking for a table for 6 but 2 of our friends were 10 mins late. we got a booth that usually seats 4 people cus those are the only booths available at the reataurant, then the host rudely tells us we had to have our whole party here even tho we werent even taking any extra space! On top of that... What kind of server tells their customers that we had to order all at once! Bro.. Not chill. the server didnt come back to check up on us.. the tonkatsu was 7.50 for ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_7 small cuts of over deep fried pork. Not coming here again.",2
"Now I've never had ramen in Japan, but I have had it all over the world and Daikokuya is the only place I call home. The wait can be long, but it's worth it.FOOD: 5 starsWhen you have a broth this good (prepared at an ""undisclosed location""), there's really no need to offer 3-5 other brothers. If you don't mind a little more fat, ask for the KOTTERI FLAVOR. I did a test between this and the normal broth and it was noticeably richer in flavor. The chashu is soft and tender, the noodles are the right amount of sponginess, the egg is hot on the outside and cool on the inside, and everything just seems as it was meant to be. Last time I also got a side of the new CITRUS STEAK RICE BOWL and it was pretty good. Flavorful with a nice citrus ponzu sauce. SERVICE: 4 starsThe Japanese have always been known for their service. Although this place seems kind of like a hole in the wall, I cannot recall every being disappointed or unhappy with the service. Servers are attentive, patient, and cheerful. They are always in a hurry, but they should be when there's a long waiting list anyways. No complaints. AMBIANCE: 3.5 starsThe place is full of historic advertisements from Japan around the 1940s and 50s. Westernized Japan. Colorful and culturally. Plus the yellow awning outside is unmistakable. In spite of their small size they managed to squeeze in a small waiting area to go with their booths and counter.",5
I went to this place again and I'm updating my review from 4 to 5 stars. I think my expectation was so high the first time that I didn't truly appreciate what I was eating.This is the best raman and Japanese bowls I've ever had. I also like that even though they're so popular and always busy they don't rush you. They let you take your time to decide and there's no rush to eat and vacate quickly.,5
"I've been meaning to try this place for some tasty authentic ramen, everyone says this is ""the best in LA"". I meant to try the location in Rowland Heights, but I guess it was shut down. So here I am in LA, of course there is no good parking anywhere (lol) but we ended up going to a $3 parking structure and walked up the block to Daikokuya. WAIT TIMEThere was only a small line at the time we arrived, so I asked how long the wait is and they said 20 minutes. I figured that was too good to be true, considering I was reading every yelp review while waiting in line.. and it was. We ended up waiting about 50 minutes in total (party of 4). Oh yeah, and all members of your party must be present when they call your name, or else they will give your table away. So you kind of have to wait outside (all indoor seats were taken). Once you get inside, be prepared for a very loud and crowded restaurant. I wasn't expecting it to be that crazy considering it was at the end of the night, but hey this place is poppin'. FOOD We ended up getting the Daikokuya Ramen special, the special comes with salad and a side bowl of chicken and rice. One bowl of ramen is plenty for two, we could hardly put a dent in the bowl. I mean it was HUUUGE. Hard to tell from the pics, but it really is. The ramen was very flavorful and the noodles were thicker than I expected, it was very good! The service was good, our waiter was very nice and he frequently checked up on us. Overall I would come back again, but I really wish that the wait times weren't so long. Especially when they told us one thing and it ended up being another.",3
"Nice and cozy old style Japanese atmosphere with old posters on the walls, great menu selections, friendly and efficient waitresses, and delicious cold noodles and fried rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Wait time would have been shorter had we taken the empty seats at the counter, but we wanted one of the booths so we waited about ten minutes more which was not a problem. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The kitchen staff looked like they worked nonstop with all of the orders they filled. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Will be back again when it's cold outside for the hot ramen noodles.",5
"What can I say that hasn't already been said? I compare all of my ramen adventures to the ramen at Daikokuya, it's that good, so believe the hype! They specialize in one kind, tonkotsu ramen. The chashu pork is perfect and tender, the broth is nice and fatty, and the noodles are the thicker kind.Get the ramen combos! The fried rice or shredded pork bowls are good choices. I usually order the combo and then take the rice bowl to-go. Lunch for the next day, boom.There is always a 1+ hour wait, but it's definitely worth it. If you want to cut the wait time, come during the hours between lunch and dinner, or late night a few hours before it closes.Cash only!",5
"The first time I tried Daikokuya I was underwhelmed. Every time since, I've been blown away. Daikokuya makes some damn good ramen! The fatty pork broth, the molten egg, the cuts of pork, throw on a large heaping spoonful of garlic from the table and you've got yourself a great meal. Wait might get ridiculously long. Try to go during nonpeak hours. Good luck with parking. Street parking is hard to come by. Might as well fork over a few dollars and park in a lot.",5
"Well, since my last review, I've returned to Daikokuya a few times. I still don't eat ramen often, but I believe my palate has matured quite a bit over the years, and I am definitely able to appreciate Daikokuya more now than I had in the past. And I've been to a few other ramen joints, so now I'm better able to compare them to Daikokuya.During this last visit, I ordered the Combination: salad, Daikoku ramen, and a small fried rice for $12.50. Simply stated, this is one of the most perfect combos you can get. The salad is small, but I love the dressing; I usually finish this in about 45 seconds. The ramen is not only the best I've had, but it's also consistent. I always request the kotteri flavor, which uses soup extracted from the back fat; if you know me even a little bit, you'd know how much I love fat. Of all the components that make up this bowl of ramen, it's the broth that I enjoy the most, especially with the extra fat. It is so rich and flavorful, and it's a struggle not to finish the entire bowl.And the fried rice on the side is the perfect complement to the combo. It's just the right amount without taking you, or the meal, over the edge. I love everything about this combination.Great food and service at really reasonable prices deserves five stars in my book.",5
"My husband and I took my siblings here and we all loved the food here! We all ordered the daikoku ramen (some with kotteri and one without) and a shredded pork bowl with salad (part of the combo). The ramen is to-die-for! I especially love their broth! My sister really liked her pork bowl, but didn't care for the salad as much.My complaint about Daikokuya is only that they are so good that the wait is SOOOOOOOOOOO long. The atmosphere could also be better, but I'm thankful they still serve food late at night. Please bring locations out of state!",5
"The line for Daikokuya is always the longest and most persistent at Little Tokyo so I decided to swing by right at opening in order to skip the wait and be among the firsts to get seated. The open kitchen is now enclosed but the vertical layout with a middle walkway that delineates the narrow counter space facing the kitchen from the row of booths stacked against the wall have noticeably aged since my previous visit. I quickly situated myself at the exact same spot at the counter, and before anyone noticed the space was filled to the max as a line begun to form outside even before I had a chance to order. Price is a tad higher than their competitors as a bowl of Daikoku ramen costs $8.50. They have added a creamier tonkatsu-style Kotteri broth as an option for ramen enthusiasts for the same price. First time diners should know that a hallmark of Daikokuya is their ramen-rice bowl combinations with a list of nine options to choose from. I also think it's wise to come early and be decisive about your choices when they come around to take your order. My eyes grew bigger than my stomach as I ordered the Kotteri Daikoku ramen with Teriyaki Eel Bowl ($12.95). The Kotteri broth was not too salty but very fatty and creamy sweetened by sesame seeds, green onions and sprouts. The depth of pork flavors still did not go far enough for me, and the broth was not hot enough in spite of my request for it to arrive at a higher temperature. Their chijire-style egg noodles were semi-firm and not as thick and chewy as Mottainai, the bomboo shoots should be firmer, and somehow the two large boiled eggs were mistakenly cooked all the way through. The chasu was succulent and struck a decent balance between lean and fatty parts. Portion was good with equal proportions of ingredients, but I still enjoy the taste of Mottaiani and Santouka with Daikokuya at a distant third.The ramen was a solid 3.5 star with a more subdued ""marble effect"" and several inconsistencies noted above. What propelled my final rating for Daikokuya was the Teriyaki Eel Bowl, which I ordered as a shout out to my Yelp friends Kit H and David N who are big fans of eel. The small bowl was tightly packed with three thick pieces of succulent teriyaki eel on top of a layer of seaweed and steamed rice. It was very delicious that helped to hit the spot. I also received a complimentary salad which I was also fond of.Service was brief with a mentality to usher people in and out quickly so the line outside won't be stagnant. As a case in point, I received the check before I even received the teriyaki bowl, and once I finished my meal I felt that they were already looking forward to turning over my seat without letting me decide if I wanted to stick around longer. I don't think they were doing this consciously, but the atmosphere with which conveyed these subtle messages was in the air. I would be interested in returning but not likely as often as I would with Mottainai and Santouka.",4
"I have tried many many times to find ramen better than Daikokuya, but alas, it is an impossible task. Their broth is flavorful and thick, and it is unlike any other. The noodles are slightly al dente and wonderfully compliments the broth. Their ramen is the best, AND their delicious takoyaki serves for an amazing appetizer.The service is quick and the portions are pretty big. The wait time here can get pretty long (the longest I've waited was around an hour), so time your arrival well! (:",5
Really good food for meat eaters but the wait is long and there are no vegetarian options. Don't go here if you don't eat pork and aren't willing to wait 30 min to 1 hour.,3
#1 Ramen in Los Angeles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The Champ. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And next door at Marugame Monzo - the best udon noodle in Los Angeles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is a POWERHOUSE block.(Get the Ramen with back-fat).,5
"4-5 stars for the Daikoku ramen. It's a large serving and very good. Pork broth has really nice flavor. Chashu is juicy and tender. Bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and onion taste fresh. Boiled egg is done just right. Overall a nicely balanced bowl of ramen. 3-4 stars for the gyoza. They are on the larger side, good enough to satisfy a gyoza craving but not the best I've had. Only real bummer for this location is there is always a long wait! There isn't much of a waiting area either so be prepared to stand out on the sidewalk for 30+ minutes. Parties of two sometimes do get to skip ahead of larger groups to sit at the bar, this has happened to me a couple times. I think it's worth the wait but I'd probably try to avoid coming here with a large party.",4
First time I got ramen and seriously blew me away!!We wen't there during the lunch time but still had to wait since this is a rather tiny place for the amount of crowd it gets but if you'd ask me it was totally worth the wait!Besides the amazing spicy ramen ( which is actually really spicy if you'd ask me :) )they also had this amazing Japanese decoration like a couple of old One Piece comic books in Japanese and these movie posters it just made the whole image complete,5
"This is one of my favorite ramen places! Every time I'm in LA I have to come here. The last time I was in LA I stayed at Miyako which is literally right IN FRONT of Daikokuya, so every time I looked out the window I would see the long ass line from the moment they open to the moment they close there is ALWAYS a line. Is it worth the wait? Yes most def! They have the most savory &amp; most flavorful broth ever. Not to mention the BEST ingredients. From the noodles to the pork belly to the egg. The egg was perfect beyond words! I love when the egg is soft boiled. (: My faves. Tip: put your name down, go across the street to the japanese village mall, get some mochilato,, go to mitsuru, or get some macarons at 'lettte as you wait! Dessert before meal, anyone? Oh! &amp; CASH ONLY!",5
"Broth was the bomb. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Seriously, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I love ramen and I couldn't get over how deep the flavor of that broth was. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_100x over I would wait in line for this place again. Group of us also split a California roll (skip it mediocre taste), fried rice (pretty damn good, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_try is if you have space), ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and the gyoza is definitely worth a try while waiting for that dank ramen.",5
The food is very delicious! The only con to this place is the wait. The wait really sucks. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But the good is definitely worth it. And its very reasonably priced!,5
"I am amazed to see how many reviews have been made about this place. This small ""hole in the wall"" Japanese ramen place hit the spot three weeks ago. For those that live more towards the east, there is a Daikokuya that just opened in Monterey Park. We waited about 45 minutes to finally get a table. Was it worth it?!? Yes and no. Yes because there was so much hype to this place that it was hard to walk away from this place. No because I am a little impatient ;) Other than that, the ramen was flavorful. The broth was actually a broth! The noodles were tender and the meat was yummy! I got a side order of eel bowl because it came with the combo. That bowl was DELISH!!! I was too full to finish my meal, and I ALWAYS finish my meal! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya UNO .. And ZERO! I honestly still can't figure out what the craze is about all these ramen places!?! I tried going to another one in San Gabriel and it was another hour wait, so I didn't even bother!The only reason why they didn't get a five star is because there are THREE Golden Rules they have printed in front of Daikokuya. Basically people cut and I believe because they knew someone who worked at the restaurant. They spoke in a different language for five minutes and low and behold they were seated right away. HMMMMM. No worries, I had a really good time!",4
Didn't have the greatest experience on our last visit. Ramen was lukewarm and meat was 99% fat. Got that after waiting 1.5 hours. Not going to wait that long anymore. Not sure if if it was a wait staff but I kept getting a whiff of someone's heavy perfume. It smelled like STRONG fabric softener and it didn't mix with the ramen. Nauseating.,3
"LOVE LOVE LOVE. This spot is a MUST if you're in the Little Tokyo area. Be prepared for of a wait of at least 30 minutes (at most an hour and a half). The wait can sound intimidating but isn't that a good sign? Their broth and noodles are fresh and authentic, and although they are always busy the service never seems to lack. Try the Gyoza and definitely stop by for the Happy Hour if you can.",5
"Cool atmosphere, you walk in and hear old Japanese music and you can see retro Japanese signs and posters. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I get that at night you get tired but when they call out names it sound tired, lazy and quiet, so if you do go stand close to the door because they only call once and don't look around for you. Over hype for the ramen, waited almost 2 hours witch is around normal wait time. Chicken Terriaki was prepared lazy but the salad dressing was good. One waitress doesn't take humor so well but the waitress taking our plates was nice.",1
"Delicious. Wonderful. Perfect. Comforting. The tonkotsu style Daikoku ramen bowl is so intensely flavorful and satisfying, it is practically a religious experience. The broth is salty and cloudy, the noodles slightly crinkled, slightly chewy and the pork slices melt in your mouth. I love the heaping piles of green onion served on top Their famed ramen bowl is a decadent meal in and of itself, I can't finish the regular size bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I personally do not think they need anything else on the menu, but everything else I've tried (the chicken/egg rice bowl and the shredded pork rice bowl are delicious). I love the cabbage salad that comes out ahead of the combo meals.It took me a while to decide whether I preferred Daikokuya or Shin Sen Gumi. First world problems, I know. They are both ridiculously good. I've decided that if you want traditional tonkotsu, Daikokuya. If you want to modify your ramen with special additions or flavors - Shin Sen Gumi.In case you haven't heard already, it's very small inside and the line is always long - know that before going so you don't get frustrated. Put your name on the list at the door and plan to wait 20 minutes + depending when you go.",5
"After seeing how highly rated this place was, my friend and I decided to try it out for the first time. We waited for about 40 minutes to be seated but we didn't mind because here we had these very high expectations and thinking ""oh it""ll be worth it"". The servers were very nice, service was fast but I was very disappointed with the ramen. We both got their specialty Daikokuya ramen and chicken teriyaki and really it was nothing special. The ramen was okay, the broth was okay, and it was just okay overall. I felt like it was missing something- some extra flavor or something! We were expecting it to wow us with all the reviews but just felt that the place is just really overhyped.",3
"Came on a Monday night, and waited about 10 minutes before we got a seat, woohoo! Small joint and a bit hot, but we didn't mind. A friend and I shared a plate of Takoyaki, and it was really good! Great texture, and had a good crunch to it. We ordered shared a bowl of Steak Rice Bowl which could use a little bit more sauce, but I think it was good. Split a hugebowl of Spicy Miso Ramen, the broth was good, not too oily. I could use a little bit more spice, but I like mine with a kick.",4
"Good God the wait is almost unbearable at Daikokuya. Of course, we could all stroll a couple doors down to some other ramen place, but none of us do.We stand .. we sit ... we wait ... we walk to some other store ... we play on our phones ... we wait ... All while secretly hoping that another ""no-show number"" will be called so that we are magically one step closer to finally getting chosen.We contain the frustration and endure the wait ... all for the food: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the simple, yet delicious ramen and rice bowls of Daikokuya.The Kotteri Daikoku Ramen is worth the wait. It starts with a delicious n fatty Pork Broth infused with their secret Soy Sauce blend. The perfectly-prepared Chijire-style Egg Noodles can be cooked more firm on request, but it is not needed. Completing the large bowl is the right combination of thin n tender Kurobuta Pork Belly Chashu, a marinated Boiled Egg, Bamboo Shoots, healthy Bean Sprouts, lots of Green Onion, and Sesame Seeds.I recommend getting a combination with one of the small rice bowls because they are nearly as good as the ramen. The best? It is the Shredded Pork Bowl with extremely soft meat. It's like you're not eating pork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Other recommendations are the Tempura Bowl for large tempura veggies and one tempura shrimp or the Tuna Sashimi Bowl with big slices of fresh tuna. On my list to try is the Salmon Roe Bowl. All combos are served with a cabbage salad which surprisingly tastes good, too.The Gyoza at Daikokuya stand out because of their unique open-ended wrapper and their garlicy freshness. An order of five is a great appetizer although I have to admit you probably don't need it because the combination is a lot of food. Of course, it's all better splitting a large bottle of Sapporo Beer.The hostess and waitress are busy, yet, just attentive enough. It's amazing how quickly the food comes out sometimes. The place may have a long wait, but they are ready to get you fed and on your way as quickly as possible. Hats off to the stellar service.Parking? Forget about it. Come after 8:00 to troll for a free spot on the streets of Little Tokyo or just simplify your life and park in one of the pay lots. Be sure to avoid the small lot across the street from Daikokuya. They tried to charge more than their advertised price.Come to Daikokuya prepared to wait. Come to enjoy the funky retro 70's Japanese decor. Come to share the combo Pork Bowl or Gyoza. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But most importantly ... come to Daikokuya to experience some great Kotteri Ramen.",5
"The ramen here is really great! The broth has so much flavor and it's huge!! I also tried the gyoza and the fried rice because of all the positive yelp reviews and they were also really good! The salad dressing on the cabbage was tasty as well :) there is usually a wait because the restaurant is pretty small, but overall this is a definite must try!",5
"I have to admit once upon a time this place was good... The quality has degraded immensely over the years. Monterey Park one is now supreme if you want Daikokuya. The wannabe hipsters that have moved in are swarming here still, like idiots. Monzo is next door serving the best udon this side of the universe. If you really want ramen go to Men Oh two blocks away. If you insist on ramen and want to wait in line wait in the Shin-Sen-Gumi line!",1
"Daikokuya is another one of the best tonkotsu (pork) soup stock ramen restaurants in town. The preparation and quality of their broth is comparable to Hakata (yelp.com/biz/hakata-rameÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_).I usually order the ""Kotteri"" style version of their flagship ramen dish. The menu states that it is the richer flavor of the broth, which uses added soup extracted from the back fat of a pig. Drool...Warning #1: This is a cash only restaurant.Warning #2: During rush hour, be prepared to wait an hour or longer before being seated due to the gridlock traffic of patrons.Warning #3: You will get hooked to this place and blindly come back again, regardless of warnings #1 and #2 above.",4
"I actually love their donburis (rice bowls) more than their ramen. All of their appetizers are good, esp the pork belly. I always hate the wait there, but in the end, it's all worth it! ;)",4
"My friends and I, after a long day at the beach, wanted some hot and delicious ramen so we decided to check out this place. You will need to sign the waiting list and they will skip you if you do not have the entire party there when they call your name. The line was long and the restaurant was so packed at 10pm on a Friday night. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We got to sit by the bar after 20-30 mins wait and according to other reviews, that's pretty fast. Was the ramen worth it? Totally !!! I ordered the house special ramen and the broth was very flavorful and delicious, just a bit salty. I never knew ramen can taste so good with just some fresh made noddles, an egg and 2 pieces of meat. This must be the best ramen that I've ever had. Service is fast and very friendly. Parking is pretty hard to find, but there's a pre-paid parking lot across the street. Definitely will come back when I want some ramen.PS: Little Tokyo is right across the street so spare sometimes n do some shopping there.",5
"I arrived here at about 1120 with my party and had to wait until around 1220 for a seat at the bar.. I ordered the first ramen which is called daikokuya or something in a medium size. The egg that it comes with is delicious and is perfectly undercooked so it tastes super creamy!! The egg was the best part. The ramen soup itself was too heavy in my opinion and eating the medium was almost too much food for me. Before being seated, one of my friends begged to share a ramen with me, but I was very insistent on not sharing because I wanted my own ramen bowl. I was soooo full afterward and had to hide it because I didn't want my friend to know I made a mistake in not sharing the ramen. I saw someone rave about the gyoza on the yelp comments so my party ordered that but it was regular tasting gyoza. It was definitely not bad though .. And the fried rice was only okay also and tastes like regular fried rice. Food here was solid overall. Your friends who can handle eating mayonnaise would probably like this place. I would not wait in line for this again. My bowl was $8.95 and I had to pay $2 in tip.",4
Ordered a side of tuna along with my ramen and it was the freshest quality fish I have ever had. Delicious! The service was great too! our food was out super quick and everyone was really friendly.,5
"Great place for ramen! We came here for lunch 10 minutes before they opened and their was already a line of 10-15 people. Everyone sat down, put in their orders and were out the door within 30 minutes. This place is efficient and delicious. They have their broth down to a science and is perfectly fatty, seasoned, and rich. My boyfriend on the other hand was not crazy about their noodles because they didn't give enough and weren't as well made. I'm not too picky about my ramen because I'm more of a broth person. I guess he and I will be battling it out about where to go for ramen when we get ramen cravings... If it were up to me tho, I would go here every time in a heart beat.We also got eel with the rice bowl and it was phenomenol. Super soft, fresh, perfectly flavored and a huge chunk of eel-y meat. I liked it as much as the pork rice bowl. Definitely won both my boyfriend and I over.",5
Okay we waited an entire hour thinking this place was worth it... Their food was alright-- a bit too salty it was uncomfortable! And the waiter that kind of looks like a wana be Johnney depp was pretty rude. He just refused to substitute the pork with tofu and said they don't have tofu at all... Even though they had tofu in their miso soup and also tofu appetizer! This place is definitely not vegetarian friendly and not worth the long wait time.,2
"Amazing ramen. Broth is so buttery. Worth the crazy wait you must make to get in. I would recommend getting the small bowl. It's more than enough. Gyoza are crunchy and yummy. I didn't make it a 5 star only because the hostess was not friendly and if you aren't near her, you will miss hearing her call out your name. But they don't need to be I guess. It's that good.",4
"There was a bit of a wait before I could sit and order, but the food was brought very quickly. For such a busy place, it is still kept very clean and the food is fresh and delicious. Everything is well priced, so for a plate of food and a non alcoholic beverage and reasonable tip I paid 20$. They are cash only, so know that before waiting in line. I got the Tsukemen, which is essentially a deconstructed bowl of ramen, with the traditional broth. It was very good and very fresh. The pork and egg were amazing. My only complaint was that the broth was very very salty. Amazing, delicious and rich, but very salty. I highly recommend coming here alone or with one other person. Groups will have to wait a while.",4
"Food was sooo good, long wait though. Space is kind of tight and cramped. The ""waiting room"" fits like 5 people. Food was fast and cash only! They have an atm in the back though.",4
"My first visit, the wait was over one hour.. I think two hours... I chose not to eat that day because I wanted to save all my caloric intake for the day on the savory dishes I heard about here. That was a huge mistake, I was starving and standing outside of Daikokuya... not a good combination. I made my second huge mistake by choosing to eat somewhere else...HUGE Mistake (see my review for a neighboring restaurant)Smarter and not starved, I made it here for my birthday dinner and it was delicious!!To my surprise, I feel in love with their fried rice and gyoza and barely had room for my ramen.This is my Ramen spot from now on and I recommend you go and do the wait, just bring a KIND bar for the wait so you don't make the HUGE mistake of going anywhere else!!!and the staff is very kind, catering and helpful!(BTW... free sake or beer for your birthday )",5
"What more needs to be said about Daikokuya? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place is the real deal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ramen is great! (although not my favorite place, shout out to shinsengumi)The real gem here is the shredded pork bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_wow it is delicious!If you come here and always order the ramen, try the shredded pork bowl next time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can even order a half ramen and halff pork bowl if you must have your ramen fix, (usually what i get)Service is pretty good for an asian place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_wait is usually pretty long if you go at peak hours but they seem to be a fairly well oiled machine and get people in and out fairly well..",4
"There is always a wait here... but once you taste the porky broth- you will understand why! Located in the heart of Lil Tokyo, its hard to compare all the different ramen places to each other. (My fav is Asa in Gardena). This place wins for the richness but I prefer Shin Sen Gumi around the corner for the lighter ramen and a better shoyu egg. But I love the ambience here over Shin Sen which is too loud for this lil cranky lady! The gyoza here is also excellent. My tip about this place: get your name on the list and walk around the plaza across the way.Also its cash only so don't forget to stop by the atm first.Last tip, don't try the other ramens on this block: just wait, it will be worth it!",4
"Worth the wait. While there is much debate about Ramen in LA, this place ranks as #2 or #3 for me. Their gyoza is #1 in my book, and that keeps me dreaming about the next time I'll be dining there.",5
"Worth the wait every time! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can tell how much time and effort goes into every bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We go again and again, and apparently so does everyone else who enjoys great ramen.",5
"I can never have enough of their standard ramen, and the line is definitely worth it. Tip the staff more than usual because you could tell how hard they work!",5
"Awesome authentic Japanese ramen restaurant ! I have been here about 4 different times and have never been disappointed with my bowl of ramen. Some tips to keep in mind : Seating is very limited and there often will be a wait ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_depending on the time you go. The longest wait I've seen was 1.5 hrs.They only take Cash, so be prepared beforehand.",2
"I have been coming here since my college years. Now I live in Chicago and consistantly have fond memories and cravings. I always visit when I am in LA. The biggest disappointment is that every time I go there I am hopeful that they have dusted and cleaned the place. I hate eating my food with chunks of dust on light fixtures, blinds, and pictures just hanging there waiting to drop into my face. I always sit there hoping that a gust of wind will not blow my way. PLEASE CLEAN YOUR RESTAURANT DAIKOKUYA. This visit was so sad. My egg was ICE COLD! My broth was TOO SALTY! My noodles tasted LESS THAN FRESH! I am looking for a new ramen place to satisfy my cravings and give me peace of mind (cleanliness).",1
"I know...many people will want to kill me for giving this place a one star. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But...there were bugs CRAWLING all over the window sills and the corners of the restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I almost barfed out my ramen when I saw that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Before that, I've always loved this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However now...eek. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Will not be returning there.",5
"It's worth the wait. If you read nothing else, read that, and then hurry over to get in line.The broth is perfect. The texture of the noodles will make your friend who says ""I just don't get what the big deal is about Ramen"" convert. The service is good, and if you get it on a hot summer day, it can for a good instant give you that feel like you're in Tokyo on a humid July evening, slurping (slurp to show respect) on some great Ramen that makes you ask ""What sushi?""It's got a long line, but I think it's worth it. After, slide into the happening spots of Little Tokyo for some great and affordable mochi!",5
"I did it! I finally made my way to Daikokuya and it was worth it!I went tonight, Monday night, around 8:00 PM - and there was a line! Next door, no line, but I figured if people were waiting at Daikokuya, there must be a reason! So I put my name in, and expected to wait a long time - but guess what? No wait! I was seated at the bar, which was nice, and gave me that authentic dining-in-Japan feel.I started with the gyoza (pork wonton), which was very good. In retrospect, I probably should not have ordered them because they filled me up, but they were good. A little difficult to eat with chopsticks, but delicious nonetheless. They brought me a little bit of soy sauce in what looked to be something one would normally serve cream in with coffee, but I made it work.Let's get to why I really came to Daikokuya thogh - the ramen. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen (large bowl - I didn't realize they had two sizes - I also didn't look at the menu carefully). It was friggin' amazing. Hands down, the best ramen I have had probably in my whole life. I ate it all with chopsticks. I'm proud of that. You should be proud of me as well.The broth was tasty, the pork cutlet was tender, and the noodles. Oh the noodles. So perfectly cooked! I left the egg. I don't do eggs. Would I come here again? Absolutely. Would I wait in line again? Absolutely! Perfect date place too, by the way, for those of you lucky enough to have someone! What is more romantic than walking around Little Tokyo, exploring the shops, and then eating some authentic Japanese ramen?That's what I thought. Nothing.",4
"There is always a crowd unless you arrive around 11:00 a.m. I love pork bone broth, but I prefer Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi more.This is very good but expensive for a bowl of noodles. I grew up eating Top Ramen, and would add a strip of left over bacon.",5
"Yea, just know it as the ramen shop with the yellow sign. We came half an hour after opening and there was already a wait list. We waited 30mins, got seated, got their tonkatsu ramen, and it was great. Seriously if you're here and you want great ramen, take an uber here BEFORE they open, otherwise you're just wasting your time waiting in line.",5
"Daikoku ramen with kotteri broth. That's the only thing you need to know when you go to Daikokuya. Tied with Totto Ramen in New York, this is the best ramen I've ever had in my life. Take this with a grain of salt though, as I've never been to Japan. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For just $10, you get a massive bowl of ramen where every component is done perfectly. The noodles have the perfect texture, the broth is thick and rich (though a bit too salty for me to drink all of it), the pork is melt in your mouth tender, and the soft boiled egg is the perfect consistency. If you don't mind the wait (upwards of 1 hour) and you don't mind trying to find parking in this area, I would highly recommend ramen from Daikokuya. Worth the visit if you're in LA.",5
"AMAZING!! I can't even speak it was so incredibly tasty. Authentic, reminded me of being back in Japan. No other ramen place in town even comes close to how awesome this place is!",5
"Although the wait was long, I thought it was worth it. The ramen and fried rice combination was really good. I couldn't finish the ramen and rice in the end though. It was really filling.",5
"One late morning sometime in 2015, we were both hungry and didn't have work. We swung by 1st St right when daikokuya opened. I had such a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment for the rest of the day, being able to enjoy the finest ramen without waiting in line. Remember to order the extra rich broth!",5
Definitely worth the hype. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Some of the best ramen I l've had in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got the spicy miso. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My advice is to get extra soup. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was quite filling and the egg was slightly runny just the way I like it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Cha su and soup might've been the very best part.,5
"This is definitely my go to ramen place from now on. It's a bit of a drive from where I live but I've been to Little Tokyo several times but this was my first time trying legit ramen. The broth is so rich my mouth immediately went to heaven on the first spoonful. It was a bit of a wait considering it was already pretty late at night on a weekday, but hit the spot on a cold night. Unfortunately it's cash only, but I could barely finish and is definitely worth the price. No other ramen place I've been to really compares, it's kind of a hole in the wall location but is for sure the best ramen you can get in LA",5
Food was great but not that Japanese though. Get there earlier if you don't want to wait too long!,4
"I hate waiting in line, but this place is so popular and so small, there always seem to be people waiting under that distinctive yellow awning.Typically when evaluating food, we happily focus on the best ingredient when we should really focus on the worst ingredient. It's like the old saying - only as strong as the weakest link. So although individual elements in a ramen bowl might be better at other places, Daikokuya has the strongest combination of key ingredients.The broth was rich without being fatty (although they offer a higher-fat version). The chashu was tender but not flabby. The noodles were wavy, springy, tender yet firm. The egg was the best around because it was seasoned by marinating and soft boiled. I could Cool Hand Luke those eggs without a problem.The spicy ramen wasn't just the regular ramen broth with heat added, but a distinctly pungent miso broth with just the slightest amount of heat.So there isn't a failure to communicate, they only take cash.",4
"So this place is great, I can't deny that. I used to drive an hour away just to get ramen at this establishment. It is one of my favorite places for ramen and one of the few places that can get firm noodles right when I ask for firm noodles. The reason I am giving this place 4 stars, however, is that they have decreased the amount of broth they give you from before. The broth used to be almost up to the brim, and it is now so low that I can see almost all of my noodles. The broth in any ramen plays a huge factor in how I enjoy ramen. I don't think I'll be crazy enough to drive an hour away to get ramen any longer, but I would go again if I am in the area.",4
"So I've had very few places to try ramen. I've had ramen in New York at Ivan Ramen , and a few places in LA. But I had always wanted to come to this ramen shop, and I was so glad I did . This has to bee hands down one of the best ramen places ever. I love the tonkostu based broth. The fat makes it so good. The noodles are crinkle heaven with the chives and the pork. The broth just melts in your mouths . The spicy one is way better than the original . It brings a little kick next to the original. Both soups are 10 bucks and the wait however kills it because it is that good. Beware do not go during the weekend.",5
"Their ramen is really good, but their noodles aren't my favorite. They have Sapporo beer, which is good. Ramen is about $10 + add ons are extra (e.g. extra egg, noodles, ect.) This place is ALWAYS packed, and they do not take reservations or calling in ahead to put your name down. Expect AT LEAST an hour wait. Wouldn't recommend this place for groups more than 4. Okay for dates, because you can put your name down and then walk around Little Tokyo while you wait. They have poke too, but I haven't tried it. If you don't want to wait here go to Omnichron around the corner (this place is my favorite.) or go to the other ramen place 2 doors down (they are really good too and don't have a wait.)",4
"OK ramen... I've tried this place once and I probably wouldn't go again. I go to many Ramen places, finally found my go to and this isn't one of them. Line was way to long for the food they served.. wasn't impressed.",3
"BEST RAMEN I'VE TASTED SO FAR!! I've only been to Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata Ramen in Fountain Valley &amp; Orochon. but Daikokuya was definitely the best so far. I'm not a huge ramen lover, but the broth here was amazinggg! &amp; you don't have to pay for extra toppings like other places. you get everything you want for only ~$9! the two times i've been here i've always gone around 11 am when it opens. during my first trip, i came 15 mins after they opened and all the seats were taken already. but the wait was only tenish minutes so it wasn't as bad. for my 2nd trip, me and my friends got there twenty minutes before they opened and there was a line forming outside already but we were lucky and got seated fast. i would definitely come back here again and bring new ppl to try it :) great service &amp; great food! :)",5
"Authentic japanese ramen right here y'all. Best I've ever had in the states. It's actually ramen and not packaged ramen like you'd get at other japanese restaurants. The broth is not too salty, the pork was decadent and delicious and melts in your mouth, and the poached egg is just awesome. Come early, write your name down first and walk back to Little Tokyo while you wait.",4
"We had the 1) Daikokuya Ramen, which already had delicious broth, neither too salty nor too light, and came with a soft-steamed egg2) Daikokuya Ramen with the kotteri flavor (from back fat) added which made it an even fuller richer flavor. (you can see the fat floating around as proof of it's extra tastiness)3) Pork Gyoza.5 pieces fried to perfection together into one sheet. 4) Shredded Pork Bowl. oops ordered way too much for two people... so didn't have much of it but it was super tasty too! Minus 1 star for the one hour wait at 430pm. (time estimate: there were about 10 parties of 2 in front of us) at least the area is nice to walk around in.",4
"Search of America for top-shelf tsukemen ends here.Not to belabor the point of a place that's been reviewed thousands of times, the tsukemen done kotteri is an umami explosion. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles bust open at the teeth, and the soup slurps down in a salty painfest. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Apparently the standard ramen actually keeps well enough to have for lunch the next day!Get in line early. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It gets wild as the night gets darker.",5
"**UPDATE** ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I see what the hype is about and I've figured it out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is inconsistent! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Sometimes I go in and its AMAZING but other times (most times) it's just okay. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Everyone swears this place is the best. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think it's good/great but I have yet to label it as the best. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've been on a massive ramen hunt for a long time, so in comparison to my favorite ramen places back home, Daikokuya does a good job. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is not too salty nor are the portions too small. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would like a little more flavor and meat in my ramen but this was legit and hit the spot. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Other non-ramen items we've had were:-sliced pork-tako balls-fried spicy tuna-sausage-fried riceIt's all good and a nice addition to the ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ There is usually a long wait but every time I've just left to roam around Little Tokyo and come back to find out our name was called. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service is always friendly, professional, and quick. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_$$ CASH ONLY $$",4
"Very cute place in Lil Tokyo! Inside is very small but cute and cozy. My boyfriend and I ordered our own bowls of ramen. It has noodles, egg, veggies, and slices of pork. The pork they put in the ramen literally melts in your mouth it's so delicious, and the broth is amazing as well. The portions are huge! We also ordered a plate of fried rice and it was two huge mounds of rice, and it was the most tasty fried rice I have ever eaten. We had plenty leftovers. Overall the employees here are really nice, it's very busy but the food is amazing, everyone MUST try! If you want to beat the hustle and bustle try getting here on weekday mornings as soon as doors open (11am).",5
"I'm so bummed about this place :( ... I read the reviews on this Ramon house, so I was very prepared to have to wait up to an hour to be seated, that was fine. So we get to this place and sure enough it's crowded when we get there so we put our name in and the lady said it would be 30 min... So we stepped away for a couple min and came back... We checked to see if we were called and we hadn't been... So we're waiting and waiting and the lady skips from 11 to 21... So I confronted her and she rudely responded with,"" I don't call names, I call numbers... I was very aware of that... There was no offer of an apology or any kind of resolution. She simply walked away without saying a word. At this point I'm livid and decided I wasn't going to spend my hard earned money after being treated with such disrespect.Customer service, customer service, customer service... Where did it go???",1
"My boyfriend and I are huge ramen fans. No matter where we go, we always look for a ramen shop. After moving to Sac, we've discovered that quality ramen does not exist. We've tried multiple places but have been disappointed every time. During our drive back to San Diego, we decided to make a quick stop to LA for some ramen. We ended up at Daikokuya. We didn't expect a line since it was the day before Thanksgiving, but we were wrong. There was a line, but we didn't mind the wait since long lines usually mean great food. We were finally seated after an hour. We both ordered the Daikokuya Ramen as we were told that was the best one. Excitement was building up and we weren't disappointed! The ramen was great. However, it wasn't excellent. Hence the 4 stars. We enjoyed the meat and broth. The meat was extremely tender and juicy! To die for! The broth was seasoned well, not too salty but not to plain. However, it could have been seasoned slightly more (I don't mean more salt though). The only downfall of the entire bowl were the noodles. They weren't soft, even though they weren't hard. I like my ramen noodles soft and chewy, and we did not get that. Oh, and our egg was overcooked. We wanted soft boil, and ended up with close to hardboil. I am not sure if I will come back since there are so many ""great"" ramen places in LA, but if I am in Little Tokyo I will be back.",4
"After trying other ramen places here in the LA area....still hands down the best ramen.Ordered my usual combination of kotteri ramen w/ the shredded pork bowl.When ordering the combination you get a salad, ramen and bowl of choice.Cabbage salad - Finely shredded cabbage with a tasty salad dressing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A nice way to start off the meal (yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_).Kotteri ramen - Extra fatty ;-) pork used to make the broth (yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Unhealthy...but wth it's hella good! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles are perfectly cooked and comes with some bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and a soft boiled egg (yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_).Shredded pork bowl - I opt for no green onions on my pork bowl as I find the green onions overpower the flavor of the pork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For me...it's all about the flavor of the pork so i skip the green onions or else you'd see a huge mound on top (yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_).Don't be surprised to wait 30 mins to an hour for this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, they do have a location in the MP area but I find their broth to not be as flavorful as the OG location.",5
"**CASH only*** That's the most important thing. Don't get caught offguard. There's a chase atm and citi atm. And the Ucla shop next door does cash back if you don't want to pay atm fees inside the noodle house. There are a LOT of good ramen/noodle houses the closer you get to LA. The competition notwithstanding, this place consistently has lines out the door! If people didn't leave to come back in a half hour, there would be a line to the next intersection. The waiting area is horribly cramped. Horribly. Even if you are not claustrophobic, you will be. So maybe hang outside or do some shopping at Marukai or the bookstore. Also! Remember the number (line) you wrote your name next to. The waitresses sometimes say only your number. Usually they are good about saying your name and number (the #line you wrote your name on). And boy the waitresses are cute! With their headbands or crocs. Most if not all speak Japanese btw. But don't let that fool you. They may be short and tiny but they are linebackers nonetheless and move with such swiftness they can topple you if you misstep and get in their way. Haha. I must admit I've only had the ramen bowls, salad and fried rice. There are a bunch of other items on the menu but they are known primarily for their ramen (esp broth) and their in house dressing (salads). I think the ramen bowl comes at about $10? There are extras to be had however. You can request (free) to have your Raman be made with stock prepared in the back fat of the pork. Supposed to be a richer flavor. I'm happy with the reg. though. If you get a bar seat, you sit in close proximity to other people. It's not uncommon for you to bump elbows with others. So yeah, it's a real gem!!",5
The ramen was so good. Definitely worth the 10minute wait. Would recommend my friends to come and eat at this spot. Service was great as well.,4
"A 1hour wait for a tiny hole in the wall ramen shop in LA that only takes cash. The place was run down but ratings where off the charts! Had to try it. I must say, everything was worth the trouble. BUT out of everything I tried their spicy miso ramen STILL couldn't top my favo place Chibiscus but it was good. Their fried ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_rice with chicken &amp; crab was the best thing I ever put on my tongue!!!! PLEASE ORDER THE FRIED RICE OMG. Their salad dressing is stupid dumb amazing too!! And I don't even care for salad. I'll be back hole in the wall I'll be back..",5
"I came here for lunch today with my boyfriend and It was amazing!!! We got the spicy miso ramen, fried rice and a salad. The spicy miso ramen was delicious it was very flavorful, it came with a whole egg bean sprouts which I love and green onions. We also added corn to our soup because we're corn lovers. The noodles were perfectly chewy and cooked. The servers were very friendly and we got our food pretty fast!!! I honestly have nothing negative to say about this place. It's small but worth the wait!!! We will defiantly be returning here again!!!!",5
"We planned our attack accordingly. I am from Norcal and I've seen the lines here in the past and couldn't get a chance to try it out. The lines that i've seen was terrible with wait times sometimes exceeding 2 hours.The second time around, I've stayed at the hotel right across the street and went to dinner at 4pm. Who goes to dinner at 4pm? This Filipino guy does! You at eat at 4pm and maybe you can eat again at 8pm!I tried the signature Ramen which is pretty good but I was very impressed with their Eel over rice bowl. It was super good and they gave you large portions of Eel. So for some damn reason, when the weather is hot/warm. It's super hot inside. I'm not sure if this place has AC but man, it felt like a sauna.",4
"given the long line, i expected something great but it was ok. chashu pork was sliced too thing and had no taste to it. broth was super light, noodles were ok.",2
"The ultimate comparison: Daikokuya vs Ippudo vs Totto (the latter 2 being the most famous ramen places in NYC).Sorry, Daikokuya... you can't beat Totto but you sure serve a damn good bowl of ramen! And for dirt cheap!!! Daikokuya serves AT LEAST twice as much food as Ippudo for $9. You can't get anything at Ippudo for that price.. not even an appetizer!!Enough talk about quantity because what it really comes down to is QUALITY. Daikokuya has both quality and quantity! Delicious noodles served in a yummy broth (although not as delicious as Totto's broth) with a few slices pork that are so tender, they break as you lift them with your chopsticks.",4
Great Ramen for a great price. I visit during late night hours after visiting The Edison. It's pretty tiny inside. We usually have to wait outside a while to get enough seating for our large group. Everything I've tried is just awesome! The staff has always been courteous as well.,5
"You know when you are willing to wait in line for an hour just to slurp on the best ramen soup in L.A. you are not considered crazy, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_but just in love with the ramen!When I travel, I crave the ramen here so much. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Something about the whole bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Its a special taste. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Place is small, service is good, ramen is the best! After your first time, you'll get use to the reason why people never complain about the wait!",5
"Ventured out on a late night in LA to seek out ramen, and despite the abundance of other ramen vendors in Los Angeles, I decided to visit Daikokuya due to the interesting accolades and credits this place has received.Upon walking into the place, seating seemed quite small and limited, but coming in for one, I was seated at the bar promptly. Free fountain drinks too? Awesome plus. I ordered the combination of the house ramen along with the shredded pork bowl and a side of slaw for about 14+ all together.The ramen was a generous portion. The broth was very rich and robust, almost nutty. The noodles were just how I liked them; thick and plentiful. The pork was just average in honesty. The shredded pork bowl and simple slaw were a wonderful side accompaniment. Pork was slightly sweet layered with rice, nori, green onion, and pickled ginger. The cabbage in the slaw was delicately thin and had a creamy, cool dressing to refresh and compliment the hot dishes.The great service was what completed the whole meal and evening. The guys were very attentive and genuine in their efforts to make sure everything was in good spirits. Parking is kind of a pain, and they only accept cash. Although I love my vegas spots Monta &amp; Sora, I definitely hope to try more, especially the spicy miso!",4
"The problem with having to wait for 1.5 hours to eat is that by the time you get a table, you're beyond famished. The problem with eating when you're famished is that you basically inhale your food without really tasting it with an unbiased stomach. So basically it was impossible for Daikokuya to taste bad for me.Since free streetside parking for Daikokuya was impossible, my friends (who thankfully go to school in LA and know their way around parking problems) parked in a plaza close to Daikokuya and had their parking validated by the Starbucks in the plaza whose employees already knew we were in there not for caffeine but for a validated ticket. Visitors to Little Tokyo, I suggest you do the same.After putting our names on Daikokuya's ridiculously long waitlist, my friends and I proceeded to wait in a Japanese convenience store two doors down for 1.5 hours before we got an available table in this ramen joint. Feeling guilty about our Thanksgiving holiday diet, one of my friends and I decided to split a ramen combo (Daikoku Ramen + Small Salmon Roe Bowl).Small Salmon Roe Bowl (yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_) - I love salmon roe, and Daikokuya heaped that roe on! The roe was perfectly salty and gushed with juicy flavors. I could've eaten a giant bowl of this if I didn't have some ramen to attend to.Daikoku Ramen (yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_) - I'll admit, this ramen was quite tasty. The tonkotsu broth (which is what I always get if it's available) was thick and full of that fatty, flavorful goodness. The pork melted in my mouth and was very tender. Portions were huge and my friend and I felt extremely full just eating half a bowl of this ramen each. However, I wish the noodles had a chewier texture since I like chewy noodles. But whatever, the broth made up for that shortcoming.So, why do I dock one star off? Honestly, with all that hype surrounding this ramen, I was prepared to taste the best ramen of my life. Don't get me wrong, I liked the Daikoku Ramen very much, but it was simply not worth the wait. Come here only if the wait is 40min or less. Anything more than that decreases the value of the ramen since by 1.5 hours later your starving stomach would find any average ramen spectacular.",4
"They made me love ramen! I've had ramen before and was never wowed. This one made me close my eyes and disbelief at how amazing it was. And that was with every bite thereafter. I got the house ramen with the extra fatty broth. Noodles were on point. We got there before it opened. We were in the line waiting to get in. I highly recommend doing this as the rest of the day as we shopped around to get dessert at the Mochi shop near by and look at the shops the line was consistently long. We sat at the bar as the place is pretty small so all tables were taken. Got our food super fast. Edamame, rice and Ramen. I look forward to going back when I'm in LA again which is pretty often. Yummmm",5
Not worth the wait. It use to taste ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_so much better ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_but the ramen that i had today was just ok. The gyoza was cold and seemed under cooked. Wish they get the ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_quality ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_back when they first ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_started,3
"Love this place. Not much to choose from, but you don't need a lot of choices. Their Daikokuya ramen is delicious, noodles are great, and their chashu is very flavorful and falls apart in your mouth. Definitely worth the stop! If you go earlier in the evening there won't be too long a wait, but if you go around 8 or 8:30 expect to stand outside for a while! Also it's cash only, so be prepared!",5
This place if you go at night will definitely have a very long wait. I went on a Thursday evening and had at least a 45 minute wait. They serve the food very quickly and the ramen is good. I had the signature ramen and I don't really care too much for the broth since it's a bit creamy tasting but the sides with my ramen were delicious.,4
"Simply the best ramen in LA.Arguably the best out of Japan :)I often get the spicy ramen and love it.Prices are very good as well.Only bad note: prepare to wait in line for 45 mins. Seriously. Not kidding.Oh and parking sucks around, but that is typical of DTLA.",5
"I'm a ramen nazi.I give the actual bowl of ramen 3 stars. It was okay. I've had better. The garlic paste is what made the broth. If it wasn't for that, the broth was kind of just meehh. Could've used more flavor. The noodles were the thicker type. The whole bowl was kind of overwhelming &amp; HUGE, especially if you get a combo set like how I did with ikura rice. I felt super full &amp; bloated after.I give the restaurant 1 star more because the service is very good. They turn tables quickly &amp; have an impressive system. There were no empty seats ever available cuz once one party leaves, they quickly buss &amp; wipe the area down so the next party can get seated right away.I wanted to try the kokkeri, but got there around 7pm &amp; it was sold out already :(Probably won't be back but I'm happy I got to try it!",4
"This place got a lot of hype and it didn't live up to it in my opinion. It had thousands of reviews and 4 stars on yelp, more than an other ramen house in Los Angeles; in Japan town at that. First of all I docked off 2 stars based on their cleanliness and presentation. The place is literally a hole in the wall with the place looking like it's gonna collapse at any moment. We sat at the bar which had a really small table and on top of that the ground was at an angle so it was very very uncomfortable. We ordered Sapporo which was served in a dirty glass with lipstick all over it. I told our server it had lip stick and with how busy they were she just grabbed it and brought me another one without any acknowledgment.To begin there was about a 45 min wait when we got their for dinner and I really wanted to stay and wait so we did. I got the spicy tonkatsu ramen and my gf got the regular ramen. We also got a side of tonkatsu and a potsticker appetizers. Those were prolly the best things on our order. The katsu was good and the potstickers were good too. The ramen instantly gave my stomach a turn. I suddenly didn't feel good, and had to stop eating the ramen. Complaining isn't my thing so we just boxed up the katsu and the rest of my fg's ramen and headed home. I really just wanna extend more on how this place was real dirty. The bathroom was not pleasant as well, everything was crammed in this little spot and it just wasn't a great place to eat. I'm sure the ingredients and taste of certain items are promising but they really need to change location or expand their restaurant and clean it up, A LOT!",2
"Service was good, but that's where it stops.I have eaten at many Japanese restaurants, and I will stay away from this one. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Here are my issues with this place.1. miso soup tasted more like water than miso.2. the gohan (rice) had this strange taste (can't describe it)3. chicken teriyaki had a very different taste then accustomed to. 4. tempura sauce was loaded with shaved ginger. (Never had this in any tempura sause I've eaten before)Sure it's busy, and they give you big portions, but I'm not impressed by flavor.",2
"This is the best ramen spot I've tried so far in Los Angeles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got the daikoku ramen koterri style with a side of fried rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was amazing and the pork was melting away. I wish I tried the gyoza instead of the fried rice, because the food gets you so food that the fried rice is unnecessary, it was good though but the gyoza looked better and everyone around me was ordering it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Washed it all down with a large Sapporo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If this place was closer to me, I'd go once a week",5
"Quite possibly the best ramen I have ever had. There are multiple locations for this place but I think the Little Tokyo joint is the best! Umm yum! I ordered the pork (tonkai? i cant remember the name exactly but it wasn't the house special one) ramen combo with a side of tuna sashimi. With a combo you get a side salad of thinly sliced cabbage and a miso style dressing. Oh man, so tasty! Next came the piping hot ramen. Juicy pieces of pork, boiled egg and bean sprouts. Man, Oklahoma is sure missing a ramen joint!!!! The broth is really the best part! My rice bowl was forgotten about but the waitress quickly retrieved it for me. Everyone there is super enthusiastic and nice. If you're not familiar with the area parking might be sort of a pain, but there are plenty of lots where you pay $7-$10 to park in a parking structure.Important note... It's cash only guys!",5
"The ramen is good but it steals the show on Yelp, and the salad is like the ramen's quiet but sexy little sister that just doesn't get enough attention. This shall be an ode to Daikokuya's salad...dressing.I'm on my second to-go bottle and I've had it every day this past week...I don't know what's in it but that is one crack salad dressing. It seems so simple...pureed veggies with soy sauce, sugar and water (so it says on the bottle). But it has almost a sort of divine seafood-y flavor that I just can't pinpoint. Like...fish u-pium-ami. Squid crack? Salmon roe-caine? Maybe maybe. PLEASEEEEE try the salad it will change your life, as it has changed mine.Fine, I guess I'll mention the ramen too: I like the kotteri (baaaack faaaat) broth much better than the regular broth. It almost gives it a nutty flavor, which may make sense because nuts are basically all fat? If the regular broth is a 7, the kotteri broth is a 9. The salad? A puuuurfect 10, of course.",5
Best little Ramen house in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A lot of folks know this so be prepared to wait for a seat if you go during normal lunch or dinner hours.,5
"No vegetarian ramen. Only on their summer menu? Well, maybe you will get more stars in the summer. Drove quite a distance to find out the spicy miso ramen, which is usually Pesca/vegetarian-friendly is pork based. Boo!",1
"Some of the Best Ramen I've ever had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is great, the pork is done with black pork.. extra tender. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Line has gotten long these days though. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Last time I Was there, it was 2.5 hours ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_wait.",5
"BEST RAMEN!!! I love the taste its authentic. They give you a nice hefty portion and it's affordable.Pros- open late, great food, good service, affordable Cons- no parking, limited seating, and NO TAKE OUT",4
First time trying ramen and was not disappointed in this spot!Came with 4 people on a weekday and we did not have to wait long for our seats. We actually went to Farbar a couple of and barely got to order before our names were called!It was delicious and has a great atmosphere.,5
"I mean....there's really no reason to write a review for this place....the line is out the door 7 days a week, so it's clear that the jig is up. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I am compelled to write one anyway, as I F&amp;$*ing LOVE this PLACE. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Love. LOVE. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Sit at the counter alone or with one person, or cram 5 people into a booth - the broth is rich, the meat melts in your mouth, the noodles are all the right kind of chewy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Also, order the side salad as a starter or with your meal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I know it's not cool or hip to order a side salad. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Do it anyway. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's delicious and light and a great raw-veg-ying to the pork-yang of your ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_4 stars instead of 5 only because I almost always forget about how rough the parking can be, and how far away the closest ATM is. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Yep, these sound like me-problems, not Daikokuya problems, but they do contribute to the overall experience.",4
"The place was tight, but I've never been to a restaurant that has a line so long that a lot of people have to wait standing outside which got me to think that if it's really busy, it's good! It wasn't even a weekend and we had 14 tables ahead of us, walked around Little Tokyo for a bit, sat down at some place to scratch tickets and walked back to check where our status is after 30 minutes, still not our turn yet and I was just so excited! When we were finally seated, we were amazed to see how affordable the price was. Around 13 bucks for a combo that comes with a small bowl of rice/meat, salad, and giant bowl of ramen noodles is a deal! That was more than any of us could finish and it was yummy. Waitress was friendly, it was obviously busy, but they still remember to greet us in and on the way out!",4
"It was a hot and sunny day in LA and guess what my friend and I were craving?! A steamy hot bowl of ramen! I'm so glad I found this place because it was delicious! We had to wait 30 minutes though...and when you're hungry, that is a no bueno. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, coming from San Francisco and always going to the popular restaurants, I am used to the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya cannot be compared to Ramen Dojo, which is my favorite ramen place back in the bay. Daikokuya serves a more traditional ramen with tonkatsu soup base. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was simple and delicious! I love the texture of the ramen noodles and the slices of chashu just melts in your mouth! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service was very attentive and friendly!Next time I will try the shredded pork rice bowl as well!",4
"I was first introduced to Daikokuya at this location but the one in Hacienda Heights has quickly become my favorite and now I know why. Although I have to admit that the ramen here is quite delicious I have to say that the quality has gone down quite a bit. I came here last night with some friends and I think Albert L. would have to agree that the egg is overcooked and cold! All true ramen lovers know that the egg in the soup has to be semi-raw so the delicious golden yolk drips out into the broth. This was definitely not the case last night. Also, this place is just way too hyped up and that is why there is always a 30 min+ line outside the door. I highly suggest you walk down the street to Shin Sen Gumi for better quality ramen.",3
"This place is ridiculously good - had the gyoza, spicy tuna roll and original bowl and holly crap - it is sooooo good!!!",5
"Their ramen was good, my friends let me try their food too, also delicious and fresh! When I'm craving ramen and don't mind the wait, will go again! They are open late, which is good for those late night munchies. Not really good for big parties.. but we got to walk around a bit while we waited for our table.",4
Did I mention how hard it is to find parking in Little Tokyo? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I really resent it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's like a slap in the face as I go around and around and around to look for a spot. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It seems like I spend half my life looking for parking.,1
"Terrible customer service because of one terrible staff employee. I've visited the restaurant once with my wife before ,our server did not disappoint.It was about 2 mins before the restaurant would be open. Their door was wide open. We sat in the waiting area just about inches away from the exit and one of the employees told us to wait outside. How rude is that! Customer service goes a long way. Waiting in the waiting area for just 2 minutes till opening &amp; we still had to be told to wait outside. Come on! That's freaking senseless. This employee has no common sense whatsoever! He needs to be reoriented otherwise he will drive customers away. Just saying!!!!!",1
"Bad service!!!!! We came in 2mins early today and their door was open so we went in, while waiting for the receptionist we sat in the waiting area and was told to go out again to wait! Wth!!!!!! Very bad service! Not worth the hype, we were regulars before but the rude waiter was terrible! Please tell management to lecture your waitstaff! You just lost two customers! We headed out to Suehiro Cafe instead for better service, more delectable selections and bigger room!",1
"Sooooooo busy. Be prepared for a long wait, but the ramen is well worth the wait! The one in West LA is slightly less crowded and even cuter. I prefer the WLA one. But this is the OG.",5
"This restaurant deserves all the hype. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Every time I crave ramen, I only want to go to Daikokuya! I've been to a top rated ramen place in NYC, but Daikokuya puts that place to shame! I usually get the combo with the ramen and the fried rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork is so tender, and it melts in your mouth like butter. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is simply amazing. Make sure to put the chili powder (on the table), but not too much because it'll hit the back of your throat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The fried rice is pretty decent, not the best, but still really good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have to say though, the salad with that special dressing is to die for! I usually get an extra side for like $1. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Whenever my friends tell me they went to little tokyo and say they had good food and it isn't Daikokuya, I tell them that they didn't have the best. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got a lot of love for Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Definitely give this place a shot. This place is always busy, so expect a wait...a long wait.CASH ONLY",5
"It's aiiiiiightttttt.My cousin came to visit and wanted to do touristy LA stuff so since I, myself have never eaten here but have always been recommended to this place, we gave it a try together. We went on a busy weekend morning so the wait was a biatch. 45 mins totaled but this gave us time to catch up. As others have mentioned, they should invest in some instructions on how waiting works. There were some people who just came in line and waited until we told them that there's a list to sign in. Ramen was DELICIOUS at first, then it got SUPER salty and then the refills of water in our cups were being requested constantly. Would I go back? NoOnto the next one.",3
"Did they just raise their prices? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ate here a few days ago and their infamous Daikoku Ramen is now ($8.95).I'd recommend coming here during a weekday, if possible. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait time is significantly cut down from the weekend. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Expect to wait around 20 minutes if you come around 5 or 6pm!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And the food comes out faster too :DFor some reason, the broth tasted saltier this time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Perhaps the broth isn't intended to be drank like water lol. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Nonetheless, it is so tasty.And NEVER compare ramen at a restaurant like this to ANY sort of dry packaged ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles here are tender, chewy, and have a nice slightly doughy-rameny texture to them.The near by metered parking is $2.00/ hr and if you don't mind walking a bit, you can find metered parking for $1.50/hr a few streets down. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We paid for 1.5 hrs and were able to finish dinner and walk around the Japanese Plaza and eat desserts!",4
"Came here with my friend on a weekday, there was still a line even though we came relatively past the dinner rush. We're not from Cali so we both wanted to try the top ramen in Little Tokyo...this place seemed to have the most reviews so we decided to wait and try it out seeing that there were so many rave reviews. We both got the most popular ramen and to be honest it wasn't what it was hyped out to be. The broth tasted more fishy than what I expected it to be and the pork quality wasn't amazing. I've had better ramen and it wasn't worth the wait.",3
"So you heard the hype right? You didn't? Ok, let me fill you in. Don't expect to just walk in and think it's a 5 minute wait time. Finding street parking is a B. Parking deck is across the street or there's one around the corner for the japanese village plaza. Shop is kinda inconspicuous, look for the restaurant with people crowding around the door with the yellow overhang. Once you finally get in, you'll notice it's a tiny place considering how many people are waiting to get in here. So you'll either be seated at a booth or the ""bar-style"" area. Booth can seat up to 4-5. If you're tiny little people, you can fit more. Now, for the food. If you don't eat much, you can order the half size or go halfsies and share a full bowl. If you're new, I say order two full bowls and go halfsies on either one. Not a fan of sharing? Do two half orders, but this will cost you more in the end. I saw many people ordering rice bowls as side dishes apart from their main ramen dish. I dunno how good it is, but after seeing more than three people with it, I think I might try it next time. I opted for the takoyaki, not bad. I'd give it 4 stars. So main course: an order of ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_daikokuya ramen and half order of the spicy miso. Daikokuya ramen: Nice deep flavor broth. I can't imagine having it with the richer broth, but that might be a try next time. Complete whole egg which was night. Some places try to be cheap and give you either a tiny egg or even half of one. Ramen itself wasn't all that chewy, I wonder if it's freshly pulled or not. Spicy miso: overall, no complaint. Broth isn't as rich as the daikokua but I think that's kinda understood. One thing though, wish I had spicy paste or something of the sort. It wasn't really spicy, like mild or lower at best. The pepper flakes doesn't cut it for me in terms if increasing spicy level. Overall, wait is pretty long, worth it? I would say if you're in the area. I did like it, but I dunno if I would drive 40 minutes and wait another 40 minutes in line for it though.",4
"Thank you Yelpers for giving Daikokuya newbies really great tips on what to expect (what to do during the long wait) and what to order (D Ramen, Spicy Miso, Gyoza). Great food. Fast service tho a little uneven - forgot our order to Takoyaki but charged us... good thing I looked.BTW - Cash Only but ATM on site and Citibank across the street.",4
"I wasn't sure which Ramen restaurant is the best in Little Tokyo, LA until I get there, but I quickly noticed this place being the best because though it was around 5pm on Thursday, the this place was packed while the others near there were not even as half full as them. The waiter was a good looking young Japanese hafie boy. He was nice enough to estimate the total cost for me when I wan't sure the amount of cash I have is sufficient to order the set menu -- Ramen plus Ikura don -- including tax and tip. The fact that this place takes cash only made me realize that the owner is Japanese, which is normally a good sign for Ramen quality. But it's just inconvenient for many of us, I suppose.",5
"it's not an LA experience without the wait. what i ate:- ramen + pork katsu bowl combo: the ramen was perfect, the pork katsu bowl a delicious dessert. the soup base was porky, fatty, creamy, a delicious bowl full of umami pleasure. the noodles firm, chewy, slurp-able. chashu was tender and fatty bites of heaven. can you tell, i really like ramen, especially the tonkotsu kind. i always like getting the combo, because why not pack that ramen in with a nice mini bowl of rice topped with steaming, tender katsu+egg+onion mixture? jk jk, after a few bites, i realized i should take the katsu bowl to go and eat it for breakfast the next day. i was sad about it, but what can you do about first world problems?pros:- ramen- ramen combos: seriously, try a combo! - quick service, quick turnaround- retro decorcons:- no half portions on the combos! at my branch of daikokuya in hacienda i can get the ramen combos with the half sized ramen, giving me just enough room to eat my pork katsu bowl. but what the hell is this con about really? it's a first world problem- parking sucks in lil tokyo. - wait wait wait. i've been at this branch at lunch, at random hours of the evening, during the week, on the weekends. there's always a wait. but it just makes you hungrier, and more determined to slurp up that bowl of porky creamy soup. - cash onlywould i come again? sure.",4
"Hands down my favorite ramen in LA. Even the basics like the cabbage salad with their homemade miso dressing (which you can buy in the bottle and I suggest you do!) are amazing. The gyozas are not to be missed, I love how they get them crispy on the outside. This is a super popular place and it's not large, so try going at odd times or be ok with waiting awhile, but know it is worth the wait. The staff is always nice and once you are seated service is fast. This place is insanely consistent, I've been so many times and have never had anything I didn't love. And I'm fairly picky.Bring cash - they don't take cards, and the ATM inside is a really strange one. Parking on the street is not easy, but there is a paid lot right across the street.",5
"I'm giving my review for Daikokuya after my 3rd time coming here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food is awesome even though the wait is as longer than the line at DMV, everybody knows about the ramen here but the other dishes that they make is about 50 times better than most of every Japanese restaurant I've been in. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would definitely bring guests and family here, I just hope they have more seating available. 2 thumbs up for these guys!",5
"There's really not much else that I can say about this place that hasn't already been said 5000+ times already. My dad, bro, and I decided to venture out here for an early dinner. It was probably 4:30 when we stumbled on this place and the place was already packed. We put our names on the wait list., and the wait was a very manageable 15 minutes (my bro and I have waited hours for food before so this was nothing). We all ordered the Gyoza, which was very fresh and flavorful. It came with 5 pieces, and it took everything in my being to offer the remaining gyoza to my dad and brother. My dad ordered the daikoku ramen combo with tuna sashimi bowl. The tuna was very fresh and tasty, and we all really enjoyed it. My brother was a traditionalist and just ordered the daikoku ramen, which he really liked. I ordered the spicy miso ramen + pork cutlet bowl combo. First thing's first, the salad was quite simple and good. The texture of the cabbage was spot on and the dressing was addictive. My ramen had good flavor and mild heat. The egg was cooked perfectly with the yolk soft, and the noodles had a good chew to them as well. I probably could have done without the pork cutlet bowl since I was already enjoying my ramen by the time it came out, but I think all in all, it's still a great deal. And for those who are dying to know...yes, I did finish the pork cutlet bowl but made sure to finish off my meal with a few slurps of the spicy miso ramen so that that's what my taste buds would remember after the meal was done.",5
"The wait was definitely worth it. The space is tight, but the service was great and fast. Hands down, the Gyoza was the best I've ever had. Right balance of crisp and right amount of flavor in the filing. So moist and flavorful!! I had the spicy miso ramen, it was soooo good. The broth had the right amount of spice, and you can tell that the broth had been simmering all day, such a rich taste of the pork. Amazing!",5
"By far the best ramen I have ever had! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was in the downtown Los Angeles area for a recent business trip and wanted to visit Japantown for dinner. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I read a lot about this restaurant and the notoriously long waiting times, so me and the husband planned a nice evening of shopping while waiting for our turn at the food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Go early, put your name on the list, shop / explore around for a bit and periodically check back on the list to see your progress. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Don't waste your time just standing around waiting as there are plenty of other things to do in the area to try to kill some time.Food: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The menu had a good variety of different ramen, toppings and other fried and sushi items, but everyone goes here for the ramen soup. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For appetizer, we had an order of takoyaki (fried octopus balls) and it was tasty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The sauce flavor was great, and it was a little on the greasy side but still really good with big chunks of octopus in it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For dinner I had the daikoku ramen and my husband got the spicy miso ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The serving sizes were huge. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We both stuffed our faces until we could barely walk, and we still had a lot of leftovers to take home. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork broth in the daikoku ramen was so rich and succulent, and the portion sizes of the extra toppings we ordered were very generous. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This was my husband's first time having real ramen, and his mind was blown!Price: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The price of our meal was very reasonable, and a great value if you consider how large the portion sizes were of our soups. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_What amazes me is the quality of the ramen for about $10 a bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The appetizers run $5 - $10 each, and the soup toppings were also very reasonably priced.Atmosphere: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I really love places like this. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's a bit small, a bit crowded, and a bit on the loud side but no one cares because you get great food in a very comfortable setting. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Me and the hubby were seated at the bar and were able to watch all the food being prepared. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I did a lot of shopping before we were seated, so I had a few bags randomly place at the floor by my seat, and the table full of people behind us were groaning in joy with their bellies full of food, and no one seemed to mind as everyone in there was enjoying their food in a relaxed atmosphere. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Also, this place had a lot of Asians eating there (a sure sign that their food is authentic.)Staff / Service: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The waiter who served us was great! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They would yell your name and place number when your table is ready and greet you as they walked you to your seats. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_His timing was perfect a he took our orders and gave us our drinks. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Food arrived fast, and our waiter even chatted with us a bit as we were finishing up our food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Fast, friendly service! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can tell the waiters here love their jobs, love their customers and love doing what they are doing.This is probably one of my favorite restaurants I have been to in the Los Angeles area, and will make it a habit to visit again when I go back down to southern CA.",5
"I heard about this place on my first visit to LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The hype was on par with Ippudo in NYC. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Sadly the place did not meet expectations.We went on a weekend and like most, experienced a long wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Nothing of note about the shop, old but clean with a few booths and stools jammed into its smallish space. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can't miss the shop - the storefront is small and narrow but there are always people waiting outside.We were there for the Tonkatsu so ordered just that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The prices are just slightly more than the others we tried in LA at just under $9. The ramen was good no doubt but not spectacular like many others claim it to be. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was thick and tasty plus ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the slices of meat was sufficient but not quite as tender as some of the other ramen houses. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The toppings were pretty much the same - egg, green onions, bamboo, sprouts, etc.A solid bowl of ramen but the long lines, costs (including parking), and other ramen options make it a OK for me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Like most this place is cash only.",3
"Expect atleast 45min-1hr wait but the wait is worthwhile , guaranteed ! :D The portions are fulfilling and I've ended up with leftovers to go. Yes it is true about their hot miso soup, it is very delicious. The pork is cooked to perfection; tender and soft. I highly recommend this place to anybody that loves ramen noodles",5
"Waited an hour to get seated today but worth the wait! No frills ramen place, staff are friendly, attentive and efficient. Quite a small place. We ordered the combo ramen with a side of sashimi rice bowl and beef bowl. Big portions, well flavoured, delicious! Would go back",4
Hid away from the tourist in a spot in Little Tokyo this is where the locals go to get the ramen... A small mom and pop looking place but the one thing you notice from the customers ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_everything is very authentic.. I had the spicy miso ramen with pork and I have to tell you some of the best I've ever had.. The broth added by the chili oil was excellent..combined with the best noodles..cooked perfectly..made for the best bowl of ramen soup..ever..cant wait to go back!,4
"Here comes in a pescatarian trying to get some Ramen. Just needed to go to City Hall when I noticed a line outside this cute little restaurant. Asked the Gentleman what's going on and he said the food is just worth the wait he pointed next-door and said this place is just as good if you're in the mood for Ramen noodles"" I came in but didn't have the option to order anything other than the sushi. Everything has pork in it. Hostess and waiter were kind of cold, but I liked the ginger and garlic paste provided on every table. I wouldn't go back but I'm sure it's good",4
"Always packed, always delicious. This is authentic ramen. It gets a little stuffy in there so just be mindful of that.PS I saw Flying Lotus here once, it was awesome.",4
"Ordered the daikokuya ramen, which is their signature tonkotsu ramen, as well the takoyaki and gyouza. The chashu (pork) in the ramen was very tender and flavorful and just came apart while eating. The broth, however, was average and could use more richness though they have a ""rich broth"" version that I will have to try next time.The restaurant is quite small so the lines are long, but service is very quick once you're seated. Definitely expect to wait for a seat, even if you arrive at 9pm on a weekday like we did.",4
"Does Daikokuya even need a review? It's a divine broth &amp; melty pork w/ perfect eggs. Gyoza's steamed &amp; fried, fried rice tastes great. Only thing I could complain about is that sometimes their ginger tastes kinda old.. But it's pickled ginger... I mean, it's preserved... that's kinda the point.Go here, just check your calendar and make sure it's not Anime Expo weekend, otherwise you'll wait for 3 hours.",5
"If you are so hungry this place would not suit you cause the waiting list is SOOO long lol they should get the available space on their left side so they can sit more people and not have such a crowded, HOT! And when I say HOT u will see people sweat like a pig lol.. I think they need to turn the AC ON!! Every now and then!!! They also have electronic pads to take your order but does NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARD so bring CASH!sometimes the ATM machine is not working (by the restroom)! another thing the rest room here is so dirty!! But but but their food are amazingly good!!! Oh by the way find a good spot to park they have cheap one for $5 just look around don't get lost tho =]",3
Didn't even get to try the place. Straight up informed when you name is called. By the time you make it inside they have already moved onto the next person. Total bullshit,1
Really good food. Best ramen in town hands down. Extra pork for $3.00 and extra ramen for $1.50 I usually get both amazing food.,5
"My go-to ramen place! LOVE the broth! If you aren't scared about high cholesterol, try the kotteri broth. It is the super fatty version of the broth and worth all the calories! I usually go with a friend and order one regular and one kotteri so that we can mix the broths in case it is too rich. Another must try item is the pork-cutlet bowl! It is steamed with egg and sweet onions on top of rice. It is perfectly seasoned and tastes the best when it comes out piping hot. Also tried the eel bowl and even though it was yummy, it was a little too sweet for my taste. My favorite ramen place so far! However, the only con would be the wait.. My boyfriend and I came at 8:30 on a Monday night and the wait was still 40 minutes long! I wish they had more tables inside or the workers would be more efficient in their seating. After you are seated though, the food comes out really quickly. Definitely worth the wait",4
"The tsukemen (dipping) ramen is great. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their chasu pork is probably my favorite in all of LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The lines can get very long, especially if you've got a bigger group.",5
"Daikokuya is undoubtedly worth the wait!.. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This tiny ramen establishment is simple and makes me feel at home. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There's a ramen bar with a few tables for 'groups' but I wouldn't recommend going in groups more than 2 simply because your wait will probably be longer than it needs to be. They turn tables around pretty quickly and have an efficient process to keep things going..I don't give 5 stars often, but this was well deserved. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen is hands down the BEST I've had in years - and all the other side dishes are like toppings on a cake; not figuratively though but you know what I mean (we had tempura and tonkatsu which were both delish!).. also - they're CASH ONLY!",5
"I've tried really hard to find a better ramen place. I mean like, I've tried really hard.But I can't. I've ruined my taste buds from eating ramen in Tokyo so every time I gobble some ramen in Los Angeles my expectations end to be overly judgmental.Daikokuya is the closest thing you are going to get to real Japanese ramen. Not even the top ramen places in New York City comes close (which is really sad when you think about it)But lets not get too hyper. Daikokuya is still far from overall flavor from what you'd find to the real thing in Japan BUT it's ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_millions of times closer to anything else available in the USA. So go out, enjoy. Get fat, live love laugh. I took a star off for that line outside the restaurant. It's stupid long just to warn you and they don't do take out. Go 10 minutes before closing and you'll be better off.",3
"Food: Daikoku Ramen - The noodles tasted freshly made, the marinated boiled egg was perfect and the broth was delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I felt that the presentation could be a bit better (uploaded photo) and I've had Ramen where the pork belly chashu was marinated/slightly grilled and it was a 'game changer'Shredded Pork Bowl - Excellent! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The grilled Kurobuta Pork Belly over rice was delicious and well proportioned. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was consistent all across the board.Atmosphere:Clean dining room, clean kitchen, clean bathroom and I love their ATM machine.Service: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Great Service! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The staff are cheerful and our waiter wore a smile and cracked jokes - Excellent Experience.Price: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A little bit higher than average but it was worth itWait Time: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_0 minutes for 2 at the booth - Thursday 11/7 at 6:30pmOverall Experience:4-Stars (4.5 if I can) because it was a great experience (staff) and the ramen and shredded port bowl was fresh and delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_In my opinion, I didn't give Daikokuya a five because of the presentation and the pork belly chashu in the ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My Journal:I compared the Daikokuya Ramen (LA) with the Totto Ramen in New York. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'll definitely return to Daikokuya Ramen and I'll try to Tsukemen next time.",4
The ramen is good. Thank god we didn't have to wait long when we came around 4pm. Would I wait for 2 hours...i'm not sure probably not. So try to go in between lunch and dinner.,4
"The ramen here was so yummy but I couldn't enjoy it because it was so darn hot in that restaurant! For a place that is doing so well with their business, you would think they would get a new air conditioner or something... We were sitting right next to the cook on the bar so that didn't help that much as well. Maybe it would've been a better experience if I wasn't sweating so much. I look for the overall experience, not just for the food. Food was great, but I wish I wasn't wiping my forehead every 3 minutes.",3
"Pretty good ramen but certainly not the best in town. The broth was just ok and the noodles were a little undercooked, but the pork slices were delicious!I would eat here again, and the staff was very friendly.",3
"If all men were like ramen, then what a warm, happy place this would be. I would take a hearty bowl of this stuff with no hesitation. I don't have a whole lot of experience with ramen but I can tell you that 1st world buck goes a long way here. You may have to wait long but once you're seated you can belly flop right into the stuff and it seems never ending. It's like you immediately come down with a case of hungry eyes!A great Little Tokyo staple.",5
"Now I know the ramen is just well.. ramen but given the wait that we incurred (1 hr. 15 mins), I was expecting to be blown away. Don't get me wrong, if you have the time, I definitely recommend you checking this place out but I'm sure you can find another location that offers the same yummy ramen with less of a headache. Also, they only accept cash - hmmm.. how convenient for them.. so keep that in mind. I had the spicy miso and our group shared the tempura - both were great and the portions were just right. If this still peaks your interest, keep in mind a few thing; parking ($10 across the street), long wait, and cash only.",3
"Came here last week for the 2nd time in my life.It was ""okay"" the first time.and it was ""okay"" the second time. I don't know what the hype is all about about this place lol.Wait time is hella long as everyone knows.The taste wasn't that great. I mean, I finished my ramen of course, but it just wasn't great.",3
Love love love this place. It's a must for my my sister and I to stop by Daikokuya or else our trip wouldn't be complete. The capacity if the place I believe is like 20 or something. There's usually a long line but the waits not that bad. Right across the street there's a little market you can entertain yourself with. The food doesn't take long. It's worth the wait if you are waiting and plus it's cheap.,5
"I chortle when I mistranslate the restaurant's kanji as ""Big Black Family.""BEST RAMEN EVER. For $8.50, you get a heaping bowl of perfect noodles in the richest broth I've ever had. You don't even need kotteri-styling to get to this level of flavor intensity, and who needs extra back fat anyway (Do pigs even have backs? Isn't it the top? We digress.).It was fun to sit at the counter and watch the dudes fry up the rice and dole out broth from the huge tanker up front. Next time, they'll probably have to restrain me from diving into that broth tank.Pay the extra $3 for the chahan (Japanese fried rice). It has a good char to it and they use kurobuta pork. Huge portions, so we each had a bowl of noodles, split the rice, AND still had enough for a snack the next day.Restaurant has a lot of character too, so plenty to look at while you wait. Just put your name down and go for a little walk in Little Tokyo.",5
Worth the trip from NorCal!! We were there in Dec....I'm a bit slow with my review. The Ramen is delicious! I also loved their gyoza and fried rice. Looking forward to our SoCal trip in a couple weeks and this is our first stop. The lines can be long so either go early or late. We waited an hour when we went and it was about 1pm....2pm when we were seated. The staff is friendly and service is fast. Cash only so be sure to hit an ATM first.,5
"This is a gooood spot for ramen. Also good for couples or small groups of 4 because it is a really small place but with good food so the wait might be a while. I went near closing time and there was still a long wait. Service was good, employees were nice. The restaurant Is located in Little Tokyo.",4
"This is the yummiest ramen I've had. The place is small and the wait can get a little long, so come and expect wait time.",5
"Daikoku Ramen and Gyoza. That's all I need. You want authenticity, then Daikokuya is the perfect place. The portions and overall taste of their ramen is spectacular. The Gyoza wasn't oily or over cooked. It was super tasty and I couldn't stop once I tried one. Don't get discouraged by the huge line of people waiting outside to get a table, the wait is worth it! So excited to go back to little Tokyo to eat here again.",5
"We waited for an hour and a half for this place, and I must say it was well worth the grumbling stomach. The service was quite efficient and got us our food in a timely manner. I got the spicy miso (with corn) and the broth had a lot of body and flavor. The noodles itself was cooked very well (I want to say al dente).",5
"The line out the door on any given evening may having you asking yourself the question, ""Is the ramen at this place worth the wait?"" The answer is, ""yes!"" The line won't take as long as you may think. This is a simple place. Enter, sit, order, and eat. Simple food done well, extremely well, is what makes most eating a joy. Ramen at its best. There are other items on the menu to choose from, but while they look good, ramen is the word.",5
"My co-workers and I walked by at least four empty restaurants offering ramen within a few blocks of Daikokuya. This place has the ramen market cornered and for good reason. The wait was long, but after devouring my spicy daikoku ramen, the wait...what wait?",5
"Spicy miso was not that great. The soup didn't have that much flavor and it wasn't spicy. Or at least up to my standards of spicy. I like how they give you a lot of noodles including a whole boiled egg. Although, the boiled egg was semi cold. Also, they gave more than one slice of chashu pork. The original ramen had more taste and was enjoyable. But there are better ramen places. The restaurant was warm inside. And it felt crowded. The interior spacing and seating could have been better arranged. BTW It is CASH ONLY!",3
"My favorite ramen restaurant EVER (though I can't say that I'm some sort of ramen expert--I've never had ""authentic"" ramen from Japan)!!!This is our favorite spot in LA. If we can't decide on a place to eat, Daikokuya is our default. The wait, however, is horrendous (even on a weekday!), and we typically have to wait at least half an hour before we could get seated, but the ramen is well worth the wait. Their ""specialty"" ramen is Daikoku Ramen, and you HAVE to get it with ""kotteri"" flavor (which is literally pork back fat--yum!!). The Daikoku ramen has a tonkotsu soup base and it comes with tender pork belly chashu and a marinated boiled egg (I'm leaving out the other stuff, but the pork and the egg is where it's at!!). My mouth is salivating just writing about it.As for the appetizers, I've tried the gyoza and fried spicy tuna (spicy tuna wrapped in shiso leaves and then battered and deep fried!), both of which are really delicious and pretty unique compared to other ramen places. You just have to try it for yourself.And if you're really hungry, you can get a combination, which includes a bowl of the Daikoku ramen, a salad, and a small rice bowl. The ones I've tried are the chicken and egg; pork cutlet; tempura; teriyaki eel; and fried rice bowls. All of them are good and you can't go wrong with any of them. Though... the tempura one was just okay (basically a few tempura pieces atop a lot of rice).The ambiance of the place is great, too. It makes you feel like you're in a mom and pop ramen shop in Japan, with the decor that are essentially beer ads from the 50s. The restaurant is really cramped and small, but with ramen this good, who cares?? I especially love the goatee'd waiter that has a loud booming voice (I tell everyone that he sounds like an anime character), though I haven't seen him there the last few times I've been to Daikokuya. Sadness...All in all, the ramen is great, parking is sparse but there are parking garages (it IS downtown, after all), though I hope I haven't hyped up this place too much. It's just a must-try place if you happen to be in LA and/or love ramen!",5
"My boyfriend suggested to try this place when we went out on a double date. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is always a crowd standing outside so we assumed this place ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_must be ""poppin"" so we gave it try. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Let me tell you it was worth the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We waited for about 40 minutes and fortunately we were able to wait and sit comfortably inside the restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However we did notice that a couple of customers are inconsiderate about others that are waiting and starving ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_while they just chit ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_chat on the tables even though they've finished eating and had payed the bill. Anyways The food was delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My boyfriend and I shared a combination plate which includes a small salad, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the ramen soup and a port cutlet bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The salad was amazing especially ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_with the dressing in it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Soup was good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I really loved the brothe. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Even though my boyfriend and I shared we had half of it to go. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was A LOT of food. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Probably spend ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_about $25 of food including ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_sake ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and beer. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Definitely ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_would come again.",4
Japanese ramen at its best. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_5 stars hands down! :DExpect a wait if you go at peak hours. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Went there for for dinner on a Sunday evening and waited an hour and a half. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the ramen &amp; fried rice combo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen broth was savory and had a deep flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The thin pork slices melted in my mouth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The fried rice was amazing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The meal was perfect. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was totally worth the long wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Next time I shall go during off peak hrs so I can have a food-gasm right away. :),5
"Daikokuya is one of those word of mouth, small hole in the wall establishments which if you weren't looking out for it, you just walk right by it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Those types of restaurants are some of my favorites.I was in the area and it was early lunch time, so I stopped in to beat the rush. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got there around 11:30 and I was sat right away at the bar. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The focus here is definitely the ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They have their standard Daikokuya Ramen which is profiled on a whole page on the menu and is obviously their best selling item. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They also have Spicy Miso Ramen, which is not listed on the menu, but they have signs around the restaurants advertising it.I went with the Spicy Miso Ramen which is $.50 more than the regular ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The portion is huge and more than enough to fill you up. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_As for flavor, it is definitely one of best ramens I've had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles are cooked to perfection is the broth is fatty and thick, also full of flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If that isn't enough, there is an option for an even thicker broth.Service was quick, so I was in and out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Only downside is that it's cash only, so be prepared.",5
"Anything here with pork or pork belly in it is fantastic. Tied with Shinsengumi for my favorite ramen in little tokyo, Daikokuya excels in particularly tasty meat. The wait times are always worth dinner at this place.",5
"Okay, here's the deal. When the family wants to go on vacation and the family doesn't want to help research or plan where we're going to go, what we're going to do or what we're going to eat, then the family can darned well do what i want to do! Are we clear on that?We were on a five day feedfest that began on Friday night and ended on Wednesday night. I tried to vary the type of food so no one would get bored. and Tuesday night happened to be ramen night. Now my sister had suggested another restaurant because they served more than just ramen BUT she wasn't on this vacation, so her vote didn't count. Arriving in Jtown around 7pm, we parked and headed straight to our destination. There are a ton of restaurants in the area and most of them were open but only one place had a line out the door. Yes, it was Daikokuya! Of course, the fact that they only have six booths and about 15 counter seats may be a partial explanation but people were still waiting. And no other restaurant looked even 1/2 full. Cut to the chase. It took 1.5 hours to get our table. It took all of 45 minutes to get our food and destroy it. And it was onolicious! Here's what we got and how we scored it on a 1- 5 scale:(5) gyoza - 2 orders; never seen them presented the way that they were, looked more like egg roll shape than gyoza shape but darned yummy.(5) tempura - 2 orders; hot, crispy, not overbreaded, 3 prawns and losta veggies per order(3) california rolls - 2 orders; meh, they were okay but pretty run-of-the-mill. (5) Daikokuya Ramen - 4 orders; big bowls, lotsa ramen, just the right amount of fat pork, whole eggs that were't over boiled to the point that the yolk turns green(5) Fried Rice - 3 orders (as combo with ramen) yeah, okay, so we like to eat...(1) Chicken Teriyaki Don (as combo with ramen) so sad, so bad. The teriyaki was more of a glaze than a sauce it was so thick. While the chicken was okay, we would have been better off with another order of fried rice.We finished everything but maybe two orders of the fried rice which we took in a to go container.",5
"The waitress, at the end, demanded, ""service tip please."" That was unexpected. Anyway, food is great. Service is horrible. For the food, it was worth the wait. The service wasn't worth it.",4
"Dang i guess I'm just the only one not super impressed. If you want to squeeze into the smallest restaurant in the world...go here. When you get here, you have to sign in. And wait about an hour to get a table. The tables are very close to the front door, so when you finally get to sit, there are people hovering over your table while they wait for theirs to be ready. Once I sat there was fast service, &amp; the food was OK.",3
It already start a line even this restaurant not open. I waited for more than half an hour but ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_it worth all the waiting. The spicy ramen actually not spicy. But I like the soup soooo much ~,5
"Hearing that there are lines at Daikokuya, we arrived at around 10:45am before they opened at 11am. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There was only a few people ahead of us but it definitely was full by the time they opened. Whew smart move! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Parking can be a pain in this area so we just decided to pay $5 for parking. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is a simple venue with bar stools to eat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not quite a hole in the wall. I like how they provide different combinations and appetizers.Ordered:1. Daikokuya Ramen in the fattier broth of tonkotsu combo with tuna sashimi rice bowlThe bowl of ramen itself is bigger than usual! I was very surprised but the egg was delicious. Not as good as orenchi since it wasn't completely medium boiled dripping yolk, just the way I like it.Tuna sashimi, of course, I couldn't expect top notch sashimi. It was alright but you were able to tell it wasn't very fresh. Damnit should of stuck to unagi!I am glad I got to try this place after hearing about it so much! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Definitely would come back here again!",4
Holy moley! This place is small but the food is legit! Go visit on a weird time so you won't be hustling with the rush of people and line up outside. Well worth the wait granting its a 20-30min wait. Combo that shizzy all day baby!,5
"The spicy miso ramen is tasty. I got the combo with a side of fried rice, and although it was a ton of food, it was all really good. Definitely had to take the fried rice home though. The service is fast, and the wait time was pretty average for any place on a friday night.However, i have to say I've had better ramen in the Bay Area.",3
"I do not eat top ramen ever. It's disgusting. For years my husband tried to convince me that real ramen is nothing even close to packaged stuff. A few years ago we visited Japan where I finally got to taste the real stuff. Since then we have been in the hunt for a place to get our fix in. Place found! The spicy miso ramen is amazing. The gyoza, also amazing. The only place better to get gyoza is at my mother-in-laws house or Japan. We also shared the katsudon, which I have also avoids trying for as long as possible. I have I say my husband rather enjoyed his ""I told you so""! We've been back and will keep going back.FYI - be prepared for a wait. It's a tiny place and is busy. Totally worth the wait.",5
"Nani!? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Did I just fly back to Tokyo and took a sip of what I thought was already the best ramen I had ever tasted in my life?..... No, but Daikokuya certainly comes a close second, and was definitely a teary reminder of what Japan has and what ramen restaurants here should strive to achieve.In short... this is one of the BEST ramen you're going to find outside of Japan.Matt M. and I wanted to venture into Little Tokyo for a late lunch, and I suggested coming here after hearing all about it from my friends. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_He had already gone here, so he quickly sped through the 405 and 10 to arrive in downtown LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Like others have said, parking is a pain, and we decided to park in the lot across the street that costs $10 for the entire day (or $2 per 15 minutes).Daikokuya does not take any reservations, and no take out orders, so upon arrival be sure to sign your name and party number. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The smaller the group, the faster you'll end up inside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Like many have said, this is really the size of a shoe box. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There's barely five booths, and two larger tables and a bar area. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We waited half an hour for a bar seat (and during that time, we went geocaching around Little Tokyo!) ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, putting the wait and the pain of parking aside, this place is epic!Once we were seated at the bar, we knew exactly what we wanted... the Daikoku ramen combo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Matt M. ordered the shredded pork, while I opted for the pork katsu. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_He also ordered a lemonade, which our waitress offered to refill constantly! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Bottomless drinks are always a good sign in my opinion, but if what I hear about the ramen is accurate, then all I need is that sweet broth in my mouth.First our salad came out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was simple but had a tasty dressing on top that made it a very light appetizer. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It warmed me up for the second item they brought out, our bowl of rice and shredded pork/katsu that we ordered. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My katsu was made with egg over rice- a very good portion for one person. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I took my first bite into it... and my mouth went nuts!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork was delicious! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The tastes in my mouth began to remind me of the times I had katsu in Japan... no lie! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It did not taste heavy at all, and the texture and tenderness of the meat reminded me of authentic Japanese cooking. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Mmm... I was only able to eat a few bites before they brought out the bowl of ramen.I took a few sniffs, looked over at my friend and asked again, ""so is this REALLY that good,"" and took my first sip.OH. MAH. GOD. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I WAS BACK IN JAPAN.Well... close. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But seriously, this ramen is top knotch! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Filled with bean sprouts, chashu, onions, a broiled egg and noodles... you would think a simple bowl of ramen such as this would just be what it is... simple. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, this bowl of ramen had flavors that literally exploded in my mouth! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was delicious!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth was full of flavor, and did not once feel like it was too heavy for me to drink all of it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles themselves were cooked to perfection (and yes, this seems silly because how can anyone mess up cooking noodles... but it's possible). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The chashu definitely melts in your mouth as you bite into it... and before I knew it, they were all gone.I think I spent a good amount of time eating and sipping on the broth, almost forgetting that I had a bowl of rice and katsu on the side. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_By the end of the meal, I definitely could not finish everything, but I felt beyond satisfied with the bowl of ramen I had just eaten. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I am very impressed with what I tasted. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This really, really comes close to the ramen I had back in Nishi-Kasai in Tokyo... it looked the same, and definitely reminded me of the good times back in Japan.So while the wait is long and parking may be difficult, Daikokuya stands above that, and is definitely worth all the trouble just for this bowl of ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I am definitely coming back.",5
"The good: This is the best ramen in LA. Broth is second to none. Don't be fooled by imitations. This is the one. The bad: The waiting procedure. It's losing a star for this. I came on a Sunday 15 minutes before they opened. There were a few people standing around outside. The door was propped open and, as always, their waitlist was sitting on the stool. I signed it. And went back outside and just waited around. Weirdly, a line started forming. I thought: I come here once a week, these people probably don't realize there's a clipboard with a waitlist sign up. So i continued to mill about. Then - they open up. And start seating people based on the order of the line. I was so upset. Why have the door open and the clipboard out? But then, she walks out and hands the clipboard (which, apparently, they start using after the first wave for some reason) to a random person that just walked up. It gets passed around and now I'm tenth in line on the newly relevant clipboard. I waited an hour and a half to eat. Infuriating. I considered not tipping but I eat here too often to make enemies. Also - the cash only no credit card thing is ridiculous. Get with the times.",4
"I've had this as an unfinished review for about a month now? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I decided today was the day that I sit down and finally write my review, as if my one review will make any difference amongst the hundreds of reviews this place already has. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've been to this Little Tokyo location as well as the Monterey Park one and both have had a significant wait time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, the service has always been good and the food has always been worth the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They don't give you a checklist of options for your ramen like the SSG Hakata Ramen place I went to, but I still find this place to be better. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Here they automatically give you bean sprouts, boiled egg, flavored bamboo shoots and green onion slices in your soup along with the chasu pork at no extra cost! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles are nice and chewy, with a nice curly texture which puts this place over SSG bc I really don't care for their straight noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_On the table or in front of you at the bar they have a condiment caddy with all the ginger and garlic you need. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I like to put a scoop of garlic in my hot soup the moment I get my order for some extra flavor and I like to eat the ginger bc my Korean ass needs kimchi or something like it when eating ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And although they don't offer spicy miso (at least not to my knowledge..) its completely fine with me bc I just go crazy with their chili powder which does the trick. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I like to share the gyoza appetizer with whoever is dining with me, it always gets served sizzling hot with a mound of thinly sliced green onions that penetrate into the potstickers. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Even as they cool, the skin of the gyoza is crisp, never soft. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have yet to try anything else here other than their ramen and gyozas, but I never leave regretting not trying anything new. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For someone who loves to eat, I usually order the small half size bowl, at first you might think its a dinky serving, but after you've finished your bowl clean you'll realize how full you really are. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So far no other ramen house compares to this place!",4
"If you're looking for a ramen place in Little Tokyo, look no further. We were debating between here and another place, and decided on here. Such a good decision. Last night, there were four of us with varying tastebuds and everybody left with happy tummies. :) We all shared some gyoza and a cucumber roll to start, which were both excellent. Ramen is obviously the big thing here, so three of us ordered that. My boyfriend and I really liked the spicy pork ramen. (It's only mildly spicy but served piping HOT) His dad said the spicy miso ramen was excellent, which I believe since he are the entire bowl! His mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl, which came over rice with soup and salad - delicious! The marinated eggs were a yummy surprise - looks a little weird but if you can get past that to try it you won't be sorry. Overall this place is a gem. Huge portions, really fast service, and it has the same atmosphere of actual Japanese noodle places in Japan.",4
"The ramen here is off the chain! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I always hesitate on ramen places mainly due to the fact that sometimes the restaurant makes them a bit too salty to my taste. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, this place is not the case, the texture of the noodle was al dente (for my Italian folks) and the broth? dang it was not too creamy or soupy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was just right. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Came here with a party of 4 and the wait was about 45 minutes at around 7 PM. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you come by yourself or with 1 other person you will have less wait time because there are single person seating available that generally opens up rather quickly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The damage:1. Takoyaki: Get these! I wouldn't say they are the best I've had but they will definitely satisfy your cravings2. Gyoza - These are definitely unique. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'd recommend you to order one to share! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Make sure you use the dipping sauce!3. Daikokuya Ramen: If you're unsure what to get, go with this! Can't go wrong4. Daikokuya Ramen + Small Teriyaki Chicken bowl combo: If you're really hungry and wants variety get this. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, if you can eat more ramen then you should just order extra ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The small teriyaki Chicken bowl wasn't good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was actually really salty to my taste.Note: I got the #4 combo from above and I gotta say, it will fill you up! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen itself will too I'd say. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got extra Chasu pork and I definitely say that is a good choice!Parking is hard in the area but you can find flat rate $5 parking right nearby so you don't have to aimlessly circle around.Another note: This place is right next to Little Tokyo so don't worry about filling those stomach up because you can walk it off near Little Tokyo.",4
"The Pros:Let's try and make this review simple. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My first time ever eating Daikokuya was a life changing experience. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I never knew how good ramen really was suppose to taste. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The options here are very simple, and definitely not vegan friendly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth I ordered this time was very rich. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Which is an option you can order off the menu. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When I do go to ramen restaurants I like to order spicy miso. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, Daikokuya does not offer this kind of option. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But it doesn't matter this place has a delicious creamy soup base and noodles are really good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Go ahead and order everything on the menu, because all of its worth trying once. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All the ingredients taste fresh and are made to perfection. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Like the half boiled egg, green onions, bean sprouts, pork belly slices, noodles, and the very delicious soup base.The Cons:This place is very hot inside about 90ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¡ at all times, with no relief anywhere inside. There might be some kind of ridiculous wait time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Also, they should have a huge sign in the front letting customers know that this is a CASH ONLY restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Parking can be somewhat of a nightmare. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you go during peak hours of operation, be prepared to hopelessly try and find some free parking. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_While your stomach starts making noises at you, because you want some of the best ramen offered in L.A.",4
"2nd best Ramen around after Santouka. Get extra fat. Broth is good, the noodles at Santouka still take the cake.",4
"Great ramen, the noodles are perfectly textured. Plus you can wash it down with a mug of kirin beer!",5
"Yes it's good ramen, but the wait time and lack of seating makes me give it 3 stars .",3
"I have always wanted to try this Japaneses noodles place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is always a long wait outside at night. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Overall, It was good, but still perfered Pho at anytime !!",4
"The ramen soup was really tasty. Lots of variety on their menu. Good friend rice. The line isn't bad whether at 11am or 11 pm. Service is good, and they will get you seated as soon as possible. Street parking is difficult still in downtown though. Great combo deals, which allows you to add things like fried rice (excellent), chicken teriyaki or tuna rolls.Overall a cool place in the heart of Little Tokyo.",4
"This was the best meal I've had in L.A. and definitely my top ramen experience that I will compare all other ramen experiences to going forward.I went with a buddy on a Saturday night. The 45 minute wait for a couple seats at the bar was well worth it. The staff was very attentive to our needs and I liked being able to watch the cooks do their thing behind the bar. I highly recommend the spicy miso ramen. The broth and noodles were fantastic, and I was stoked with the portion size you get at Daikokuya.The only complaint I have is that the restaurant is cash only. However, it was truly one of those rare experiences where the food absolutely met my expectations. I left full, happy and looking forward to my next visit.",5
"I'm a miso ramen girl who hardly eats tonkotsu ramen yet I fell in LOVE with the Daikokuya ramen! Daikokuya ramen goes head to head with NY's Totto Ramen IMO. The only thing that the Daikokuya ramen is missing is the extremely long line (thank goodness... I've waited 2+ hours for Totto) and the thick chashu.I started off with a small Sapporo draft...only for $3.50 :)! Then the pan fried gyoza. So tasty. The gyoza skin on the sides were a little thick and chewy but the inside and the layer of scallions made up for it. The daikokuya ramen is ridiculously good. Get the kotteri daikokuya ramen. I tried my friend's daikokuya ramen without the fat and I couldn't believe they were okay with missing out on the extra flavor! I was warned that it may feel like fat was going down your throat but I didn't experience anything like that. Besides the broth, I loved the wavy noodles (I can't stand straight boring ones), tons of scallions, and the egg. I can't remember if the egg was marinated but the yolk was not fully cooked - just the way I like it. They do have other ramens (seasonal?) but if it is your first time - you HAVE to try daikokuya ramen. On top of the ramen, I loved the old school decor and the old school Japanese music my mom used to listen to. I giggled at the random retro bug spray ad.",5
"After all the hype about this place, I finally get the chance to satisfy my pallet with the perfect ramen. The soup is so rich and flavorful, i can taste the endless hours chef spent to extract the best out of every ingredient for this perfect broth. I actually like the noodles from tsukemen because the texture is very chewy, on the other hand, the noodles used in ramen are thinner and less chewy. The chasu is amazing! It melts in your mouth instantly and they cook the chasu on the frying pan with tsukemen order, spreading a very appetizing aroma across the restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork cutlet bowl on the side is a-w-e-some, perfect addition to my wonderful ramen feast. I am really glad that i start off my little tokyo ramen journey here and there's just so many on the menu that i haven't tried due to limited stomach capacity. I have to admit, Daikokuya has definitely set the bar high for LA ramen!",5
"I crave this maybe about once a week or once every 2 weeks LOL! This place is thee best Ramen joint!! One of my favorite restaurants and probably my favorite Ramen-Go-To spot!!! The wait is pretty long though its really worth it!!! You got to try Daikokuya I assure you, you wont regret it!",5
The Ramen is very very good. I had the house special extra rich with extra pork. The pork is so tender it almost melts in your mouth. I was here ten years ago and the food is just as good. My only issue is the wait. One hour at 4:50 pm is ridiculous. The place is very small. They should have expanded when the property values were low. With all the young people living downtown it is a zoo in J town. Be prepared.,4
The best ramen in town. I don't give 5 stars because the waitress there are not very nice. Maybe they had a tired day. But I'm still going back for the soup,4
"Local favorite noodle place.... but honestly, I go for the stir fried rice, the cabbage slaw salad, and the pot stickers... the soups a nice way to finish though. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Plan on 45 minute wait, can't park, and there is the most eclectic audience in the room at all times... ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_really tasty though and a great Arnold Palmer.",5
The best part of the Daikoku Ramen is the broth....super flavorful with the pork being cooked in it all night! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got the extra kotteri flavor - my friend got the regular one and didn't notice a significant difference but the kotteri seems to make the broth a tad bit richer and fattier. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You get quite a good portion for lunch (was tempted to order gyoza to start but glad I didn't). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's a small place and gets very busy so I suggest getting there before noon. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There's counter and table seating so if you don't mind sitting at a counter you might get in faster. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Parking can be challenging but was able to find street parking in front - meter is $3 for 1 hour (max 2 hours) on weekday (not sure what the policy is on weekends). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There was also a structure/lot across the street for $6.,4
"Personally I wouldn't wait for more than an hour to be seated at a restaurant unless it was my first time or I was really craving it. I'm glad that we're usually strategic about coming here and only waited for about 20 minutes. Compared to other ramen places the broth is definitely on point. It's so creamy and flavorful - I actually slurped all of it! Haha. The kotteri is a little too heavy/fatty/buttery for me but I totally understand why some people would prefer it! The regular broth is just fine for me. I kind of wish they would give you more veggies in the ramen, but then again they make up for it with the yummy chasu and full boiled egg. FYI, you can get a half order of ramen and it's just as filling!I give this place a 3.9999 because although I don't believe it's TOO hyped up, I feel like it would be better if they had more variety. Nonetheless, their staple is definitely their ramen!",4
"I had high expectations for this place thanks to Yelp. I honestly walked in thinking I was going to have the best ramen of all Los Angeles. It's not, It's really really not. It lacked flavor, the meat although very tender didn't impress in taste. Ordered 2 Daikoku Ramen bowls, one with kotteri flavor and one without. Surprisingly the one without kotteri flavor had more flavor. Portion size is ok, didn't need to request extra noodles. Wait was about 20 minutes, finding parking took me just as long. Overall not worth returning. Service was nice though!!",3
this little hole in the wall has some of the best ramen youll find in the downtown area. wait is sometimes horrible. I tend to go to shin sen gumi or men oh when the wait is an hour or more.best egg in town,5
"If you understand the accept the following you will love this place:Pros: MouthgasmCons: Parking will be a challenge, there will be a ridiculous line &amp; service will not blow you awayBest ramen in socal. Sorry SSG. You must try Kotteri. Guranteed Mouthgasm!",4
"It's definitely very yummy! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Although the waits can be exhausting, if you are coming for a late night munchies, you may want to go ahead and wait as there are waits everywhere anyway in Little Tokyo! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The chicken teriyaki bento box is really delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their only downside is they do not take credit cards.Have a fun time and enjoy and make sure you have a pretty open schedule when you come here!",5
"Delicious authentic ramen! Cash only, and small - be prepared to wait a little bit (although the courteous staff stayed on top of the wait list and kept things moving). If you leave and they call your name, you have to move to the back of the line, so don't go too far! Also, when your meal is over, don't expect to hang around for too long either, especially if the place is busy. You come in, you enjoy your food, and you leave after you pay. No one tried to take my bowl away from me before I was done eating, but the vibe was definitely ""ok, thank you, come again soon"" when we were finished. Street parking, wasn't a problem on a Friday night. Waited about 20 minutes. Food was great.Also, there are no vegan broth options, which is fine because this is traditional ramen. They do have a few other options like vegetable tempura.",5
"The 5 star hype is real. I'm not gonna deny it, it's worth waiting an hour for. Now, I had the kotteri style daikokuya ramen, which is suppose to be fattier than the regular broth cuz it has pork butt fat, let me tell you, it was fatty and delicous. Get the combo, that way, you get their small shredded lettuce salad along with the ramen for a good price. I highly recommend the shredded pork bowl. It's heaven in every last bite. I didn't even mind the red ginger, in fact i think the ginger balanced the flavors out. The salad itself was not impressive, however, that dressing is memorable. It's so good they even sell it on the side for about 5 bucks i think.Parking in little tokyo is free on sun if you can snatch a spot by a meter, however, it could be quite dangerous and/or tedious to try and park on the streets, you have been warned!",5
Great ramen place. The wait time to be seated is insane!! I think we waited about 1 1/2 to 2 hours before we got seated. The food was prepped really fast though. The service was also good. I wish the line wasn't so long.,4
"This place is PRETTY DAMN GOOD. Ordered the Daikokuya ramen and the Tsukemen (DIY dip chilled noodles/ingredients into ramen broth), and both were deliciousss. The fatty pork slices were so indulgent, and the noodles were perfectly Q/al dente. We just melted into our seats (and plus it was super hot out). They make good ramen, so just brave the 30-min wait or whatever and treat yourself :)Their fried spicy tuna's not bad either, just nothing fantastic. Servers were quick and friendly, though they kept speaking to us in Japanese so I just nodded and bowed every time.",5
"Classic Japanese Ramen. The texture of the noodles is just like you would expect in quality ramen.Classic Japanese Broth. Very dense. Mmmmmm~! I usually try to avoid broth because the sodium in broth is ridiculous in Ramen but I just couldn't resist the taste and fell for it. Overall, highly recommended. A must try.",4
"Ok, I definitely see what the hype is about! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Their pork fat broth is SO DELICIOUS. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Oh man. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They even offer extra pork fat on request. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Extra noodles are pretty cheap, but I feel like that's the only thing that I don't like about this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They were cooked incredibly firm, but maybe I can ask them to cook it longer next time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My second favorite thing? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_No charge for sriracha!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_OH YES. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tiny little ramekin of hot sauce everywhere is $2. They gave us the whole giant bottle of sriracha, no charge. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For that, I'll be coming back!!!",4
"-It is pretty small;-It doesn't take reservations;-It is busy;-It is not very clean;-It has signs like ""cash only"";-Okay priced;-Most cooks and wait staff are Japanese;-The food is good, but nothing to write home about.I'm glad I went (perhaps I even had the best ramen there), but I don't get the whole hype about this place.",4
"YUM is all I can think of when I go here! The ramen is just GREAT. If you don't mind waiting in long lines most of the time then come on down. Late at night it is ALWAYS packed, it's a pretty small place but worth the wait! Slurpin on ramen can't get any better than this!",4
"I had ramen here a couple weeks ago just before leaving for Japan, and I have to say Daikokuya was better than a bowl or two I had while actually IN Japan. So like, there are different styles of ramen (noodle thickness, broth richness, etc)... Daikokuya's thicker and chewier noodles and the thick fatty broth are indulgent, satisfying, and delicious - very comforting. I also srsly LOVE pork belly.Also had the takoyaki and a side of fried rice - both good and authentic. The octopus in the takoyaki was pretty tender and not chewy. Fried rice was recommended and didn't disappoint. I still like Santouka (in the Mitsuwa Markets) the best, but this is a GREAT ramen place. Better ambiance for a dinner outing... since Santouka is in a food court.The interior reminds me of Japan - just with a lot more space. So all y'all out there saying this place is cramped and crowded...this is like super duper spacious compared with Japan. Like not even close haha.Remember to bring cash!",4
"Daikokuya's ramen is something a lot of people rave about, which I can understand (because the noodles especially are thick--a huge plus), but I think their broth is a little too rich for my liking--but hey, if you like super duper rich broth, this is a great place to go. I'd personally only go if the wait wasn't ridiculously long (I'll go if I have an insatiable craving for ramen, and the wait is less than 30 minutes), but otherwise, I'd opt for other ramen places.The atmosphere is pretty noisy, so I don't really feel like I'm quite comfortable here, but that's also (again) personal preference. Parking is MEH. I'd rather opt for a place that has a private lot. Again, personal preference.Service is quick = +1. I also think that they've got some pretty bomb rice plates. Yum...that's about it. It's not something that's terribly memorable--I think better ramen exists elsewhere.",3
Dropped by here with my father and was pleasantly surprised on how good it was. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'm a bit of a Ramen snob and I usually don't compliment about a place so easily since I've eaten in Japan BUT... I will definitely place this on my top 10 favorite Ramen Shops in LA.I personally had the Tsukemen (Noodles that you dip in to soup / sauce instead of the traditional in-the-bowl ones.) I found it to be very flavourful and the noodles to be perfectly al dente. Price is average. Not too cheap but not too expensive either.,5
"I seriously doubt my review will matter at this point (3000+ reviews? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Seriously? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Only in big cities like LA).Here are some things you need to be aware of when you go to this place:1. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is now a new parking structure just north of West 1st street that they built rather recently that charges $1 an hour. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would definitely take advantage of that.2. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place is cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_No joke on the $$ sign. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you are a big eater like me, get ready to pay $10+. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Make sure you bring cash with you or else there is a Chase bank right across the street. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They charge $3 if you don't have a Chase account.3. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Get ready to wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We were there 1:30 PM on a Friday afternoon and we didn't get seated for another 30+ minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you're hungry while waiting, it's gonna suck to be you. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We left at 4 PM and people were STILL waiting. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_No joke.4. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The fried rice is better than any of the other locations I've ever been to. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_SO MUCH better than any other Daikokuya locations. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's OUTSTANDING!5. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They still have the big bowl of noodles, none of that silly half paper/plastic bowl crap that some of the other locations have taken up. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The soft boil egg is amazing, the soup is unforgettable, and the noodles were cooked just right. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So so good....6. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The service isn't great or horrid. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The head waitress was really nice but our own waitress was mediocre.I definitely will be back. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Make sure you go to the EAST 1st street and not WEST 1st street!!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Boy, I hate LA street names!",5
"Hurry Up and Finish Your Ramen******************************************This ramen place will have to suffice for now. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Living in northern Japan for 3 years has destroyed my ability to objectively critique sushi and ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_For LA, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would say this place ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_is pretty good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I usually get the original Daikokuya ramen with a side of white rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I like that Daikokuya's noodles have a bit of girth, a bit chewy, and slightly curly. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There are some other popular ramen-yas that have really thin straight noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I personally don't care for that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Broth: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Pretty savory and fatty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is a bit too salty for my tastes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ask for ""not too salty"" and it turns out perfect for me! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I am happy they accommodate no questions asked. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Daikokuya is a victim of its own success. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The main downside is the frustration of waiting in line. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Come during the weekend for dinner, forget it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Its good but not that good for an hour wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I am surprised there aren't more Daikokuyas in downtown. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We need at least one more.Pros: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Reasonably priced tasty ramenCons: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Parking sucks. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait sucks.",4
Ramen that i stilllll think about. Best ramen i've ever had. That is all.,5
"Holy crap, ate there today for the first time - amazing. White guy loves noodles!Get there 15' before opening, you won't be disappointed.",5
"I have been here numerous times, and each time I'm here there's are loads of people waiting to get seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait can be anywhere from 15-40 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I assume it's their trademark to keep all the Daikokuya Ramen houses tiny. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I always order the Daikokuya Koteri Ramen, and sometimes their combo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The combo consist of the Ramen, a small salad, and a bowl of either fried rice, chicken teriyaki bowl, a chicken teriyaki with egg, or an eel bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's your choice on what you would like to have with the noodles.I see the cooks and the waitresses always hustling inside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The whole restaurant is so small that you smell the food being cooked since the kitchen is right in front of the bar top. This J-Town place is a bit divey. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The walls, tables, and floors are a bit sticky from all the cooking and heavy traffic. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_So cleanliness is a bit not there. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Hopefully they clean everyday. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They at least have decent food, and it's not that expensive. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place is always a go for me.If you plan to come, just be ready for the wait.",4
"I feel like I was cursed from trying this place, because something ALWAYS came up and prevented me from coming here. I finally broke the curse and that year long curse made my meal so much more enjoyable. I highly recommend the combo because it's a lot of food and it's a really good deal.Decor+Ambiance: 2 stars **I've never been to Japan, but this place is what I imagine a ramen house would look and feel like in Japan. This place is poorly ventilated and it's very hot, especially on those LA heat waves. You'll be sweating bullets while enjoying the brothy goodness.Food: 5 Stars *****1) Ramen Kotteri style - This was by the best ramen I have ever had! The portions are generous, the broth Kotteri style (base of pork back fat) was AMAZING and full of flavor. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles were just the right texture I prefer in ramen, not too soft or tough.yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_2) Gyoza - The gyoza here were LEGEND-DARY! Not your typical potsticker-like shape, but ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_more rectangular. They were pan fried and the amount of pork and vegetables were perfectly balanced.yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_3) Pork Bowl - Overall, the bowl was soo tasty! I loved soft pork along with the sauce and scallions. I couldn't finish it because I had gyoza and ramen, so I reheated it the next day and It was still bomb!yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_Service: 3 stars***Needs some improvement. I never really expected excellent service after reading all the reviews. I just wanted to come in, get my food in a timely manner and leave. Luckily, my friend came earlier and waited for about 15 minutes before getting seated , and I came just in time. Come here expecting a line and during peak times, expect about 45 min to 1 hour wait.Parking:Daikokuya is in Little Tokyo, so parking is going to be a bit of a problem. There's a lot one block east and a small lot directly across the street. Either way you'll need to pay for parking.",4
Wow! This place was absolutely amazing. It was by far the best ramen we have ever had! It is a must try if you are in the LA area.,5
"Waited OVER AN HOUR. Ordered the combo with ramen, tuna, and a salad. Salad was standard, but too much dressing for me. I ate some of it, but couldn't finish it all. Ramen was good. Noodles were amazing, but soup base was a little fatty for me. Tuna was very fresh and very good. I'd come back here again, but I hate waiting. We'll see if my tolerance for waiting improves.",4
One of SoCal's best ramen joints? Yeah...in my humble opinion it's as good as NorCal's Ramen Dojo. I went with friends during a busy Saturday night...and like most highly reviewed places there was a (one hour) wait. I went with their Daikokuya Ramen ($9.50) with extra chashu ($2.50 for five pieces). The staff was very busy...but our food arrived pretty quickly...can't go wrong with that. The broth...amazing...rich...tasty...not salty...and ohhhh so good. Noodles were firm yet with the right amount of chew...just how I like good egg noodles. The include chashu was a good mix of lean with just enough fat to make it melt in your mouth. The egg and additional toppings really tied everything together...finished it all. VERY pleased with their Ramen.The only drawback was that I was quite full...no room for their fried rice. Maybe next time. My go to Ramen in SoCal? Gotta give it up to Daikokuya for now.,5
"Food was great! Service was also good. The ramen and half rice bowl is a lot of food! Definately very flavorful broth, you can even ask for adding ""back fat"" to enrich it.",4
"Chowhound noted a decline in quality a few years ago, but I think it has substantially stepped up since 2007. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Best ramen I've had yet in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've eaten around, mostly WLA/Sawtelle/areas closer to home. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Order the richer broth (kotteri), and extra pork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You won't regret it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You also won't be able to finish it, and you'll just be disappointed with yourself for not being able to eat more. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait was irrelevant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles were good, nothing stellar. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The pork was fine. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Everything else, acceptable. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Go try it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Kotteri-style.",5
Ramen is awesome and the price is fantastic!!! if you want some quality ramen go to any of its ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_locations. It rocks!!!,5
"After seeing that this place received many awards for its ramen and it was deemed the best ramen place in LA, i had to check it out myself. And its true, THEY HAVE THE BEST RAMEN. Its so creamy and not too salty. The pork was like butter so perfect. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service was so nice and quick. Even though it was extremely busy our waters were always full. I was hungry so i got the ramen and pork combo, its was plenty. The bowl is so big! The combo is enough for 2!",5
"I guess having a renowed food critic write a raving review has its perks!Personally, after tonight, I feel that this place is quite overrated OR that it is too Americanized (or Chinese-ized) for my taste (Yep! I've spent the last 17-years of my life in Japan).Well, to cut to the story... Arrived at around 8:10pm, and as usual - a long queue. I got in with a counter seat at around 8:40pm and proceeded to order their Daikokuya Ramen, with Chahan (fried rice), Nori (dried seaweed) and Corn on the side.Chahan was SOGGY. I had more than half of a leftover.Egg of the ramen? Tasted ol', just like soap.Chashu? All butchered and into pieces!The ramen soup? Was not ""ramen""-ly hot (or warm). And inspite of it being of ""tonkotsu""-based, was quite bland.Darn! I really miss my ramen experience back in Japan.",2
"I'm a regular!!I love their ramen. The broth is unexplanable in words and the egg is like my favorite part of the ramen. anyway, I rather come here over Orochon. That's for sure.The wait is always an hour minimum. But I truly think it's worth the wait (:",5
First thing's first. The fried rice is amazing here! You can't go here and not try the fried rice -- you'll be missing out. The ramen is also pretty great and flavorful as well! (Get the kotteri for a more flavorful soup)The only thing I would dock stars off for is the ridiculous wait time here (normally at least an hour on weekends -- so I try to go only go around midnight since the wait reduces to about 30 min)...but it's not their fault and their customer service is always spot on -- so 5 stars for them (:,5
"Waited for about an hour and a half on a Friday night at 1130 and it was WORTH it! We went with my aunt and uncle so we ordered a Combo that came with daikokuya Ramen and a choice of a meat with rice (we got chicken teriyaki and rice) and served with salad with house dressing. My aunt and uncle got a Ramen and their fried rice, which I had a taste of. Everything was SO good! Their price is so very reasonable and the quality is amazing! The place is fairly small, hence such a long waiting time but it was really worth it. The staff are incredibly nice and friendly as well, so energetic at 1245am! I'll definitely be coming back!",5
"The yellow awning! The yellow awning! I'm sorry. If I'm ever a passenger in your car or if I'm driving and we go down 1st street in J-town, you would be all too familiar by now with this little place called Daikokuya because of me. Yes, the storefront with the yellow awning, that is, if you weren't distracted by the number of people waiting outside for a table. Small place, but the demand for it is big. Ever since my senior suggested this place back in 2008 for one of our lunch outings, Daikokuya comes to mind whenever I think of ramen. First timers should not even look at the menu and just order the Daikoku Ramen. I mean, that should be the sole reason why you would venture to this place. The ingredients seem so simple and basic, but wow, what a fantastic blend of yumminess. This is one ramen where you absolutely cannot pass up on finishing the soup. I swear, the soup makes the meal---the egg, the pork belly chashu, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, the noodles are all enhanced from this magical broth! If you want something more, their combinations provide you with your necessary order of Daikoku Ramen plus whatever else you might want to sample: the chicken egg bowl (reunion of mother and child! how morbid. haha.), the tuna sashimi bowl, or whichever other 7 options you want with your meal. And while ordering, take some time to read the menu. I love their descriptions of their meals! (They dedicate half a menu page for the ramen. the other half is for the summer version. haha)",5
"The best tonkasu ramen in the city! Perfectly porky and salty. Their original location is in little Tokyo but they have maybe 4 or 5 locations now ranging from sawtelle to Alhambra. Gyzoas are delicious, perfectly crispy on one side and covered in green onions. Service is a little lacking but hey what do you expect?!",5
"We're disappointed at this restaurant. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We saw the line outside, it's must be good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It could be our taste. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodle is just ok, nothing to rave about. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If anyone of you have been at Denver, try Domo restaurant, they have much better noodle than this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The tempura is pretty bad, the shrimp is small, the coat is soggy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The miso soup is even worse, it barely warm, the seaweed doesn't a chance to soak, cause it to be very chewy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Across the street, there is Oomasa restaurant, it has much better tempura &amp; cheaper than Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_CASH only!!!",3
"Best ramen i've had to date. had the daikokuya ramen, only comes in pork no substitutes due to the pork broth. they give a brown marinated soyu egg in ramen instead of half of a normal egg. Which was a huge plus for me being an egg lover. recommend getting the medium. Large is ALOT.Be positive when visiting because yes there is a wait but it is worth it and even when the line of people is long if you're with a group time flies and the line seems to move decently quickly.",5
"Visited tonight with a good friend of mine and were welcomed by a 45 minute wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is what I expected considering the many reviews I'd read about this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_45 minutes was a small price to pay for what my taste buds and I were about to experience inside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the Gyoza and the Daikoku Ramen cooked Kotteri style. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_&amp;%#@ing Amazing!!!Definition: AstonishingSynonyms: Awesome, Fascinating, Incredible, Marvelous, Prodigious, Shocking, Stunning, Surprising, Unbelievable, Wonderful.The above phrase and its accompanying synonyms are a perfect description of my thoughts after demolishing my meal. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The dishes were quite simple yet ultimately 100% satisfying. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I couldn't ask for anything more.Thank you Daikouya, I will be back.",5
"Haven't been here in quite a while. But every time I've gone I've had a good experience. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Be prepared to wait a while, there is always a line. But it's worth it. The food is fantastic and the service staff is always great. The manager also would stop by tables to make sure everything is perfect. This might have changed, but last time I checked they don't have any non-pork options. So if you're a vegetarian or kosher then you won't be able to enjoy the ramen. It's very authentic like that.",5
"Spicy miso ramen. Get it. Inhale it. Be full.This place is great with huge portions. I wasn't too fond of the location in Monterey Park so I was reluctant on trying this one. But this was the best decision I've made in a while. This place was so great! I loved the spiciness of the soup base and the firmness of the noodles. So amazing. A huge bowl for $9.50! Great deal. I left with a satisfied tummy!Parking can be difficult but I just circle around. I didn't have to pay, but I'm not sure why.. Lol. The wait was around 30 - ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_45 minutes for a party of 2 but totally worth the wait. Definitely recommend!! :)",5
"I came out of the restaurant with a huge headache from all of the msg in the ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My partner has a huge headache also. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think that's what makes their ramen delicious, but to me that is cutting corners on authentic ingredients. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This is a dangerous chemical that shouldn't be put into food.",1
"My BT new favorite ramen place, so good he could not stop talking about it. Came here on a saturday after the wholesale marts around 10:40 am, 20 minutes before they are open and they already have people standing outside. 10 minutes later, there was already a line forming down the block. at 11:02 a guy, whom just got there I might add, called the store and asked if they are open today because they haven't open their doors yet. I knew this place was popular since I waited an hour the last time I came here, but people are so crazy lol. My group was the second in line, and they seated us immediately after they open their doors. We order the gyozas, the daikokuya and spicy miso ramen with extra ramen for the 3 of us. The server we had was super nice and he was not smug about the fact that we only order 2 ramens to share. We were going on a eating binge that day and didn't want to fill up too much at one spot, and he was so understanding. Now on to the food: the gyoza was a bit salty for my taste but a must try because it not the store brought ones that most restaurant sell. The daikokuya ramen was amazing! Even better than I remember! The broth was super rich and sweet, like they have been bruising it for hours. You also can't beat their soft boil egg, even after soaking in the hot soup it is still on point. The spicy miso ramen isn't as good at the daikokuya flavor but still really good. The portion of the noodles are huge! I shared it with my friend when it came out thinking they add the extra noodles in there already but they didn't. So when the extra noodles came out, we already stuffed just sharing half of the regular bowl. Definite must try and worth the long wait every time!",5
"Ramen is amazing, but service is horrible! Have gone here many times, but today the service was exceptionally awful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Either the girl sitting people is seriously stupid or she wasn't trained well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We asked for a booth and agree to wait. So she started going down the list and sitting some at the bar, but ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_what pissed me off is when she kept going down he list and started sitting people who came in after us before us in booths. I checked the list and our names wasn't ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_crossed off. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When she tried to sit another party down, I asked about our table and her excuse was I don't know who crossed your name out. Umm hello are you really that stupid ? Our name wasn't crossed off at all.",1
"One of my favorite ramen places. The wait is a bit long during rush hours, but generally worth the wait.",4
"Disclaimer: I arrived there starving so my review might be biased. Huge amount of food for a really reasonable price: ramen, coleslaw and beef bowl for $12.95.Really good and the service is very very fast. Only thing is cash only (ATM there) and I think it's easier to get a table fast if you go there with less than 4 or 5 people because the place really isn't that big so it gets crowded pretty quickly.Give it a try!!",5
"The ramen here was ok and not as amazing as I got my hopes up to be. It was delicious on a cold rainy day but it didn't give me goosebumps on how delicious it was. The pork belly was not a generous portion for myself and my ramen wasn't as hot as I wished it would be after such bad weather. The hard boiled egg was extremely cold on the inside after a single bite into the yolk so that was a weird combo for the ramen bowl for myself. The service was awesome. Everyone was so friendly and really worked hard to let us enjoy our meals but at the same time keep the flow of customers moving. We literally came here at 10:30am, 30 minutes before opening and decided to run a quick errand and returned back at the restaurant at 10:58am. There was a line forming already outside the door and so we waited for the restaurant to open at 11:00am in the line. When we shuffled our way inside once it opened, we 55min until we were able to get seated even when coming when it immediately opened. I guess it was a Saturday but I'm still surprise of the wait even when coming right when it opened.",3
"Yelp automatically writes, ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" when you select five stars, and that pretty much sums up this place. It is as good as it gets. I have never had Ramen this good and I never will anywhere else. This place is just beyond incredible.",5
"Wow even on a Monday afternoon at 1:30pm there is still a line! The wait time was about 1.5 hours. Seriously ridiculous. I guess I wouldn't expect anything less since there are only 28 seats available. I ordered the Daikoku Ramen ($8.50). The broth was indeed very tasty and the overall dish was well presented with tons of green onion and scallions. The pork was also very tender and flavorful. The ramen itself was ok. I guess it's kinda hard for me to like ramen since I prefer soft and smooth noodles. The egg was slightly undercooked but not like the soft boiled egg at Orenchi Ramen in Santa Clara. Overall, I would come back if I didn't have to wait 1.5 hours. I also wouldn't recommend groups greater than 4 people. Once I try Shin Sen Gumi I think I'll be able to finally determine the best ramen house.",4
"Finally, I tried the famous Daikokuya ramen. I give it 5 stars because the ramen tasted really good, however, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_considering the wait, it just doesn't make it worth it for me. The place is very tiny, and it seats a ton of ppl, I was very uncomfortable seating there bumping elbows with others. I don't know if I'll ever come back to this place because of how long u have to wait before u r seated. I'll stick to Chibiscus for my ramen carvings!",5
"Not sure what the raves about, but this place is definitely not worth waiting 45+ minutes.Find some shade or buy an umbrella because you are about to get cooked like a pork belly.Ramen quality is somewhat on the salty side. It decent and not bad at all. But I expect better...Asian lady calling out numbers is very annoying. Her voice drags repeatedly too.In my honest opinion, the ramen at the Mitsuwa restaurant is the best!",2
"A standard choice for ramen in Little Tokyo, great food... Always a line but not complaining. Ramen a little different from other places",5
Little hole in the wall restaurants are always the best! Especially when the lines just never end. I've waited almost 2 hours before and that really proves how good the ramen is. My boyfriend always gets the small fried rice combo and I get the tuna sashimi combo. I guess the only reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is because the lines do seriously get long. I wish they would expand.But Must try if you are in the area :),4
Maybe I ordered the wrong dishes but I am quite shocked at the high reviews. We went for lunch on a Friday last month. Parking was awful but after circling around a few times we got lucky and found a meter right in front of the place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait was super long! Every time I've driven by there were tons of people waiting outside so I was super excited to try it. After waiting about an hour we were finally seated at the bar. I ordered the Daikokuya ramen and fried rice combo for $11.50. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Both were below average in my book. I was extremely disappointed. I wonder what everyone else is eating?!? I'm a big fan of Kouraku which is one block over. They have really good ramen and fried rice. I don't think I'll be going back.,2
"DAMN GOOD RAMEN.I heard it gets bizzay, so I came with some pledges like 10:50am for an early lunch/brunch kinda thang. We were already the 3rd party in line. Wowee! We got seated immediately when it opened, and our orders were taken right away.We all got the house special ramen with the back fat (extra fatty) broth. However, they said they didn't have it today, so we were brought regular broth. It was still super rich and good, buttttt then our waitress said they did have it and brought out little bowls with lumpy fatty stuff.... LOL it looked gross, but we mixed it into the broth, and it was great! MOAR FAT!!! MOAR RICHNESS!!! hahaServing size looks decent, but it's actually really filling. It's also really good with the garlic that is available at each table. We just ladled it into the soup. Nommy! Also, I think the egg is the best part! It's soft and like just sweet enough.. idk how they make it, but I wish I could learn to do so! :DAnyway, parking is not the best situation, but we were lucky enough to find street parking like right in front. $2/hr by the meter.. which is .. ok haha",5
This was my first time here and I was not impressed. I ordered the spicy miso ramen and it was so salty and it made me really thirsty. The ramen noodles didn't taste that good nor the broth. I do like the atmosphere! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is a long wait so be prepared. I almost fell asleep lol.,3
"These idiots run a shot shop. The waitresses don't care if you're served, the tables are not bussed nor cleaned, and it's a free for all for the sign up. Cash only as well.... I signed up for a party of one, waited over half an hour and watched tables of two and three and four get hauled in. I watched the bussers clear tables and never once saw a dish towel or cleaning rag. After I watched three groups of parties of two get called in ahead of me (while waiting Inside and not on my cell phone, ensuring I didn't miss my name being called) I finally got up and gave my seat away ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_on an interior bench to a small family. I checked the sign in and my name was scratched, with a note saying it was called. But it never was making the waitress/hostess a total liar. She didn't care when I pointed out that they didn't call my name and I pointed to where I was seated, awaiting the entire time..... After finally getting a seat -- because I went BaCK in and reminded the idiot hostess -- I finally sat down and had the standard ramen. All in all, high quality noodles, creamy fatty broth, terrible chashu, and a marinated egg one could make at home I would say this place is not worth the wait and definitely not worth the crap service. Hakata, Hayatemaru, Santouka.... All much better and way better service",1
"The famous Daikokuya... Since this place is always crowded with people waiting outside of a small joint, I haven't tried until recently! As someone who does not like to wait in line, Daikokuya wasn't a place I HAD to check out, since they don't take reservations. I always said, wait that long? I'd rather go to Orochon! Nevertheless, after a wonderful experience at Ippudo NYC which is known for their tonkotsu broth, I had to check out the other famous tokotsu broth ramen spot Daikokuya in LA to compare them correctly. Final verdict? I still prefer Ippudo, but Daikokuya does have good broth with better portions! I still haven't changed my mind about waiting for so long for a ramen where I have other places I can go, but definitely worth trying at least once!I purposely went in time for their opening, so I don't have to wait too long. But by the time we found parking &amp; came back, we had to wait for ~45min+. Luckily, it was a fast sailing once we were seated, thank god! Gyoja - different than usual! I liked the sauce.Sliced Roast Pork - slightly greasy, but so good!Daikoku Ramen - a large bowl of tonkotsu soup! yummmmmmmmmmmmm. I think you can also get extra rich soup by choiceShredded Pork Bowl - the server recommended this to me over the spicy tuna bowl &amp; surely! It was really good! Basically same as slice roast pork, but i liked this better!",4
"I love their Ramen and fried rice. Both were so delicious and flavorful. Their pork bowl was tasty and scrumptious. Expect a long line when you go here it's always crowded so be ready to wait for an hour or more, the people just keep on coming. I gave them 5 stars because of good food and customer service, even though they are busy, they still manage to give good customer service kudos to the owner! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_1 more, one time I left my cellphone (iphone 5S) our server, sorry I didn't ask his name, he has long hair and he's wearing eyeglasses, returned it back to me. Definitely one of my favorites!",5
"We arrived by Metro around 12:40 on a Saturday afternoon and were finally seated at around 1:20. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was near 90's outside, so this was a tough wait, and the waiting area inside is cramped. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I swear we waited longer (number of minutes) than pretty much any party there -- including ones that came after us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Just bad luck with us being a pair and people taking too long at the bar, I suppose.All the ""foodies"" waiting in line here were such a turn-off. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_One lady walked in like five times in a 15-minute time span to see if she and her man were any closer to being seated. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Uhh, no, ma'am, you were after us. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When we were finally seated at the bar, an obnoxious (loud) guy was taking pictures of everything with his DSLR. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Excusable if you're a tourist, but come on.Anyway, I carefully watched the order in which our orders were taken, and our took longer than everyone else's! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Again, bad luck. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We just had a beer and two ramens -- nothing special. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Having a blazing wok going in front of me was definitely not my preference, also. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When I got my order, I did like my noodles, and the broth was quite good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I passed along the pork, but the egg was boiled nicely, and the bamboo was definitely authentic.Service was okay... you have to flag the waitresses down to get a water refill, though as soon as it looks like you're done with your ramen, they hand you a check.Overall, the ramen is probably one of the best I've had, but I'm not going to reveal my favorite on here so that the place doesn't get as hyped and crowded as this one. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would not come back for anything but the ramen... the wait isn't really that worth it.",4
"I've been to several ramen places in NYC but I don't think any place has ramen that beats Daikokuya! The texture is soft yet firm. The meat is SO tender - it just falls apart in your mouth!The wait? Yeah, it's a tad long but this place is a MUST if you're in Little Tokyo! Patience is a virtue, my friends!Everything's decently priced. Just make sure to bring cash since it's cash only!",5
"Party of 5, 2 kids, 3 adults. We all had Daikoku Ramen with the Kotteri upgrade. One of us had a pork rice bowl and salad and no Kotteri.I will not ding this place for the wait time. We did wait long, but given their small size and large popularity, I feel they did as good as can be expected to turn over tables. (Quick rant: Please people, if you had to wait a long time, don't sit around at your table forever after you are finished and make everyone else wait that much longer)The Daikoku Ramen is a Tonkotsu ramen with chashu pork and a ajitsuke tamago egg. Kotteri is an additional broth you can have added that is a fattier broth which makes the ramen richer. The broth was perfect. I have nothing more to say about it. It was delicious. I added some of the chili powder at the table for an added layer of flavor. Anyone claiming this place is ""one dimentional"" may want to try playing with some of the condiments to add a little more depth. The noodles were cooked perfectly. I personally would have liked a little fatter noodle, but that is totally a personal preference and not traditional by any means, I just prefer it that way, but they were really good noodles.The chashu pork was tender and cooked perfectly as well. I personally like a little saltier chashu pork, but personal preferences aside, this was super good!The ajitsuke tamago.... my favorite part. It was marinated for the perfect amount of time and cooked to the perfect consistency. This is hard to nail, but nail it they did. I freaking loved this egg!The member of our party that got the other dishes said the rice bowl was good, but the ramen was definitely the star. The salad looked like something that would go on a burger, but I didn't taste it or anything, it was just visually not terribly appealing to me.Overall this was a good experience with great food. Kind of a long wait, but it is totally not their fault.",5
"At 10p on a Tuesday, the wait was about 10 min.The Daikoku ramen koterri style was filling and tasted as good as I needed it to, but it had something of an odor. I'm thinking that was the koterri style - I'd never had it before. If I go back, I'll try the Daikoku without it.The service was quick. My ramen was ready a couple minutes after ordering it.The service was also quiet, with very little response other than retrieving the requests quickly.",3
"The ramen here is probably one of the best I have ever tried. The broth is pretty heavy so it got kind of old/felt too much; however, the first few sips of the broth were amazing. The fried rice there is really good too and I believe I tried one of the sushi rolls there (spicy tuna I think) and that was pretty good too, which was kind of surprising for a restaurant known for its ramen. The only major problem during my experience was probably the wait. I think I waited for 2.5 hours for a party of 4, which in my opinion, was kind of crazy....",4
My wait time today was ten mins usually it an hour but every time I come here I always stroll around little tokoyo so I don't mind the wait but if you dont like to wait than your not ready for this ramen lol.The ramen and broth is amazing you gotta try their small salad too it's a good combo.,5
"Hey, I broke my Ramen Cherry!!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's been a long time coming. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'm not proud that I got through 43 years of life only knowing Ramen as a 10 for $1 packet that you add 2 cups of water, boil for 3 minutes, then pour in the Oriental flavor powder. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_What that's not the real stuff? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It got me through college when I was out of my weekly allowance by Wednesday. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Heck I've been doing those packets so long now, I can say to the cashier ""What 25 cents each now? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I remember when they cost a dime! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You young whippersnappers don't know squat, this is an outrage!""Came to Daikokuya on a bit of a whim on the way to a Laker game. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Always thought I'd have Ramen aficionado Cathy S. to talk me through my first time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But my traveling companion for the night was the worldly Roy B. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Sure he looks like he would only know about Biscuits and Gravy from some Country Kitchen, but don't be fooled. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_He's knocked down authentic Asian dishes faster than he's knocked up Asian women. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ As such I trusted him to be my Ramen Sherpa for the night.We both got the Tonkotsu Kotteri style Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Kotteri is a thicker style broth that uses the back fat of the pork to thicken the broth up a bit. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's the Japanese version of Soul Food I guess. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ The result was a wonderful porky flavor to the broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I made sure I slurped some down before adding anything to it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After a few minutes, it was time to heat this piggy soup up a bit with some sriracha. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We both decided that next time we should go with a spicy miso base that already had the fire added to it, as we were jealous of some of the red bowls of soup coming out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We never could get ours looking like that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen noodles were nice and al dente, and somehow never really changed consistency. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You would think the longer they would sit in the hot soup, they would continue to cook, perhaps becoming a mushy mess. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Never happened. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was slightly disappointed in the amount of pork in the bowl, only a couple of pieces. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It would be worth paying for extra meat. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The egg was served whole. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_At first I was impressed that the yolk was still runny, however it was ice cold in the center. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's clear that they freeze these eggs so they don't get overcooked in the soup. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This wasn't that big of a deal because the solution was to break it in half and let the soup warm up the center of the egg. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_We split a shredded pork bowl as an appetizer. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Technically it's a main course, but the guy sitting at the bar next to us was raving about it, so we had to try. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Glad we did as it was excellent. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Shredded pork belly grilled with a sweet teriyaki glaze so it was fairly sticky. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was served with green onions, pickled ginger shavings, and rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ginger really offset the sweetness of the glazed pork well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would definitely come back here for one of these bowls. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_As good as the shredded pork bowl was, the fried spicy tuna was a let down. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was wrapped in a shiso leaf then tempura'ed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They came out mushy, throughly cooked spicy tuna mixture , and just not much flavor going on at all. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_yelp.com/biz_photos/daikÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_So how would I rate my first time? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was pretty good, but not mind blowing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My yelp bud Dan H., once said about Ramen - 'When it comes down to it, it's just soup. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_How good is soup going to be?"" ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have to agree with that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_When I told that assessment to Roy B., he countered by saying, yeah but 4 star California Ramen is only 2.5 star Ramen in Japan. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ok, I guess I need to travel a bit more and find out.",4
"All you need to know....Cash ONLY!Put your name on the list. Take whatever seat opens up.Order the Kotteri Daikokuya Ramen. Love me some fat, pork fat. RICH, TASTY BROTH!If you are really hungry, order the combo, try it with the fried rice. YUM!Service is not friendly but all you really are doing there is to SLURP UP those tasty noodles. -G I V E I T A T R Y!",4
"""How can you call yourself Yelp Elite if you've never had Daikokuya!?"" was being shouted at me the whole time we were walking here, waiting to be seated, after we put in our order, and while we were eating our ramen. My friends really took it hard that I never, ever had Daikokuya before. And how can I blame them? It's the best damn ramen I've ever had.With backfat.We waited a good 45 minutes to be seated and it's small, and very limited in seating. Cash only but quick service! We got our food in about 10 minutes. The salad is pretty good, just shredded cabbage and dressing but somehow it works. I love their shredded pork bowl. But their eel bowl is much much better! Now onto the ramen - it's a hearty hearty broth, especially with the added backfat, but it totally hits the spot. It's filling too. The ramen is such a perfect consistency. However, my only negative feedback is they really go cheap on the pork. Two pieces of pork. That's it. I mean, it's $10 a bowl. But yet, still the best ramen I've had.",5
"I came here with my dad and sister who has never tried ramen before. We parked in some lot and paid for parking. It's not very street parking friendly. There are lots that you can pay for. When we arrived, we put our name on the list. It's a very small, casual place. It seems like a popular place for business people to come to lunch (I noticed a lot of working people in suits eating and I overheard conversations regarding business matters) and it also seems like lots of tourists come here to visit. We waited about 20-30 minutes for lunch. We had a bar seating. When I opened the menu, I actually expected more options for the ramen. My dad and sister ordered the Daikoku ramen. My sister got the half size (which is $2 cheaper). I decided to try something different so I went for the kotteri flavor ramen. I am sure you can add for extra ingredients or different ingredients but I wanted toasted seaweed but it comes standard with a marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions and chashu.The ramen came in reasonable, fast time. We didn't wait too long for it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I added garlic and the spicy seasoning to my dish because I love spicy food and food with garlic. I enjoyed my ramen but the presentation wasn't exceptionally pretty or anything. The broth definitely did NOT have msg, it wasn't extremely salty or anything like that. The noodles were perfectly chewy. The broth was definitely rich in flavor. The bamboo shoots was not what I was expecting, they seemed undercooked or crispy enough. Something was off with the bamboo shoots and I love them in my ramen. Overall, it was very filling and it had lots of meat, vegetables and noodles in it. I tried my dad and sister's broth for daikoku, their broth seemed to be more rich in flavor than mine. I can see why people think this place has the best ramen because the broth has good flavor, no msg, simple ingredients. The wait staff is extremely nice but sometimes they might be difficult to understand due to their accent. They try their best to move things quickly across and ensuring people enjoy their ramen.",4
Simply transcendentLong list of people waiting for eternal bliss,5
This place has the best pork broth for Ramen hands down. You know they're great when everything they serve is carefully thought out and excellent in quality. It's a near must have if you're in the city of LA and like Japanese Ramen.,5
This is the spot! It's small and you're probably gonna wait a while. But it's definitely worth it. This place looks and feels like an authentic Restaurant in Japan. What more can I say? This is the best ramen I've had.,5
"This place is overrated! After seeing great reviews, I figured I'd give it a try. First off, the daikoku ramen broth was a tad too salty for my tastebuds. I also didn't like the fact that they only serve pork. I usually like to substitute pork meat with chicken meat but they don't even have that option. Sorry, Silverlake Ramen is still the best in town!",3
"I really love Daikokuya, but the line gets ridiculously long. I was once lucky enough to get here right when it opened on a weekend morning, but the second time I tried to get there when it opened, the restaurant filled just as we were about to walk in.",5
"I still love this place but sadly it is no longer ""the best ramen ever"". ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I went to Hawaii on a quest to eat at as many ramen places as possible. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After stalking down as many ramen places as I could find in Oahu I realized I'm never gonna look at Daikokuya the same again.Daikokuya still has amazing broth but their chasu is way way below par. :(",4
"Great noodles, great beef. Broth is good, but not amazing. Quality ramen but ABSOLUTELY not worth the wait!!!! I've had better ramen and waited for 10 min. This place took 2 hours to seat us. I was expecting ramen from the gods after seeing people stand in the cold for hours waiting for it, but still have yet to find a ramen that meets my expectations.",3
"TWO HEADS UP:1. CASH ONLY2. Expect a LONG wait.Located in the heart of Little Tokyo, Daikokuya has historically ranked the highest in serving ramen to the people of LA. With a small, limited menu, Daikokuya offers one type of ramen and makes that ramen amazing. There's not much more that I can offer in this review as you HAVE to try it for yourself. Nothing else compares. Someone literally moved a ramen shop from Japan and moved it to LA. Pros: Fantastic food, affordable pricesCons: Damn, it's a long wait.",5
This place was good. It's quite small so there will probably be a wait. We waited about 10 minutes for 2 people. It's also CASH ONLY. So have some cash handy. Food was good. Nothing extraordinary. Good lunch option.,4
Best ramen in Southern Cali!! Totally love this place the food is amazing and the employees are awesome! Sure the wait is long but it is totally worth it!,5
"Quick tip: If you're a party of one, you can get in and out easily. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Otherwise, expect an (at least) one hour wait for 2 people, add 20 minutes for every additional person.Don't bother coming with over 5. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen experience is best when you are extremely selfish.",5
"Loved, loved, loved the ramen! Tried all the ramen options they had and they did not disappoint. Hubby and I also ordered the fried rice which was just ok, I might pass on that next time. However the fried tofu is a must, it reminded me of potato croquette's....mmmmm",5
Delicious love the spicy ramen!! and also I like the fried rice Good service but the lane was so long to get a table,4
"Enjoy the classic Daikokuya Ramen or combo plate, Gyoza's for appetizers, and their Teriyaki Chicken is on point. You know they're doing something right when they bring you a specific Teri sauce depending on what you are eating it with.",5
Didn't understand the long line or the hype but the server was great.,2
"I've always been a frequent visitor to Little Tokyo and every time I visit with my friends, I try to eat here at Daikokuya. I live close to the Arcadia and the Monterey Park locations , however the taste isn't quite the same as what I remember at the original Little Tokyo location. Parking is always such a hassle to try to find when coming to Los Angeles, but the trip ends up being worth it every single time!Beware that the wait time could be anywhere from 1 hour+. Most people just leave and come back later. The restaurant is considerably small... and I wish they would consider expanding just to seat more people. I went again today, but this time with my boyfriend since it was his first time here. He wasn't thrilled about the long wait since it was 1 hour+, but when he tasted the ramen... he loved it! The broth was so rich and the noodles were chewy. My favorite part about the ramen would have to be the pork and the egg! The best ramen of my life goes to Daikokuya!",4
Cash only. Long wait on weekends so come early. The ramen portions are filling and pretty good. I'm sure there are other ramen places that are good in the area too but come here if you want a solid tasting bowl of ramen.,4
"Fantastic. Not much I can add that others have not. The wait was about 1.5 hours, but you can leave once you put down your name. This is useful is you've just arrived to Little Tokyo, a superb area to visit anytime you are in LA and want something different, fun and easy. You can usually find parking between 7 and $10 here. The most you have to walk is 2-4 blocks distance. In the Village, you'll find pastries, boba, tea and coffee, and free entertainment, often.Once you are granted access, the food does not take long. The portions are huge, so come hungry. The ramen here is great, I agree with the consensus. It is not my favorite, preferring Hakata Shin-Sen-Gumi. However, the broth here is wonderful. The noodles were a bit hard for my taste, but I hear you can have them made more tender. The flavor of the broth is very savory, with sesame, pork fat, green onion, and other flavors coming together. The side salad is simply fantastic for such simplicity. The Kotteri was indeed a nice complex melange of flavors. The shredded pork bowl is great, delicious. I prefer the ramen hands-down however and found myself hardly able to eat both. It's a small cramped spot, but well worth it. The wait isn't bad at all. It's cheap. Keep groups to a 4 person minimum. They have beer, just the Japanese regulars.",4
"I finally tried the kotteri broth and it was sooooooo good. So good that I'm never going to get it again! Why? Because I would like to live to write another yelp review. Real talk, the broth was rich but looking at the soup just makes you wonder what you're doing to yourself!It is a bit saltier than the regular broth though, so if you're eating with someone else, just do what I did and trade soup :D",5
"The wait was about 50 minutes long (8:40pm to 9:30pm on a Thursday night) but I'm so glad we stuck around. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have to thank my bf's brother's gf (wow, a mouthful) for taking us here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_5 stars is tough to give because no restaurant is perfect, but I have to give it to Daikokuya. Many ramen restaurants have similar tasting broth and if one is better than another, in a couple of days you can't remember exactly why. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, Daikokuyu has the best broth I have ever tasted, by a long shot. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is an extra element that I cannot describe, almost creamy.. egg-y.. and very delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_One sip and I knew right away that nothing I had had before comes close and that I will probably never enjoy SF/bay area ramen the way I used to.They only have two varieties of ramen: daikoku ramen and another one where the broth comes in a separate bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had the daikoku ramen (amazing tonkotsu broth). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You can also choose to get the richer broth which is even more amazing.The ramen comes with bamboo, a large soft boiled egg, lots of green onion, seaweed, bean sprouts, and some pork. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Each table is equipped with pickled ginger and chopped garlic. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Four spoonfuls of garlic + Daikokuya ramen = pure bliss in mouth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Mmmmmm. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_TOO GOOD.",5
Best ramen in la. That's it. It is the best. Thus place holds about 8 people at a time. I think Kim kardashian's shoe closet it bigger. There is always a huge line. They have a somewhat efficient self hosting station going. It's cash only. But all of that nonsense is worth it. I like the spicy miso ramen. The pork just falls apart in the best of ways. It's a huge bowl too. I get extra noodles too because my appetite is that of Kobiyashi after getting off a 12 hour flight. If you want some tasty motherfuckin' ramen get there an hour ahead and enjoy. It's well worth it.,4
"after hearing people rave about this place, I had to go check it out myselfthe wait was about an hour on a Saturday afternoonI was starving by the time we were calledthey start you off with a coleslaw type saladwhich I inhaled because I was fucking starvingthe wait made me angry because I mean would you really wait an hour for some stinking ramenbecause I didanyway I got the combo w spicy miso ramen with the cutlet bowlwhich I also inhaledoverall it was tastybut the wait is too longwhich I understand because it is a dang popular spotI will only eat here if the wait is shortbecause princesses don't like to wait*snaps finger*",4
"The best place in LA for some authentic Japanese ramen!!!!! I usually order the ramen and small fried rice combo here. Their ramen is so richly flavored with pork stew and miso. The noodle itself is cooked to perfection possessing both the chewiness and softness. also the fried rice is so delicious with shredded pork and rich flavor. i do not know what their recipe is but who cares? Everything is so delicious!!!One downfall is the wait time. They always have so many people waiting to be served. Oh well, all this can be blown away with a single sip of the ramen!! It is definately worth the wait. Make sure you bring enough cash because they only accept cash.",4
"Horribly hot. The taste was quite creative, but also a little bit weird for me.",3
"Unlike the opinion of many other reviewers, I think this place isn't as good as the joints in SF (Katanaya, Dojo, Orenchi), or the ramenya's in NY (Totto, Ippudo). The must try's are the fried rice and shredded pork rice. I love that they are generous with the noodles and the broth unlike most places; I would recommend splitting with someone. BROTH:I got Kotteri (with fat), and man it was fatty. The creaminess reminded me of milk. It was pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere. For fatty broth lovers in NorCal, go to Orenchi. Many claim they use less MSG here, but 30 minutes later I was pretty parched.NOODLES:I usually like this type of squiggly noodle (vs. the thin and straight noodle). It's a bit thicker, and I think egg-based. However, it wasn't very bouncy here, it was just kinda hard. I think they cooked it perfectly al dente, I was just not a fan of the quality of this noodle.TOPPINGS:They soft boil an egg, but because they don't make it to order, the insides are gooey but cold. It's a little gross eating a cold runny egg, but I know many other ramen houses have to do this in order to meet demand. You can't add extra toppings. Some people gripe about how they use too many green onions but I didn't mind it.",3
"Brace yourself for Daikokuya! There's a reason why hipsters, foodies and Asian folks all line up to see if they'll find the best ramen they have ever tasted. Haha..I'm one of those folks. You come to LA to eat Ramen, In &amp; Out and Mexican Food.Daikokuya serves a pretty good experience. No gimmicks, just a gritty Little Tokyo spot serving some damn good ramen. The pork belly was soft and succulent. The noodles were firm and tasty. The egg was cooked medium which was coo though I like the egg a little runny to get that yolky flavor in the noodles and broth. I loved the bamboo shoots and the sprouts to give a good mix of vegetables. You can't beat the price too.Top your ramen off with a beer and your long wait has just been rewarded. To note, the Katsudon (pork cutlet bowl) was pretty wack. People come here for the ramen. I was just way too hungry getting off the plane. #CashOnly",4
"I gotta admit, I'm not not a big fan of ramen, at all. But this place does have me second guessing myself. Maybe, I should give ramen another chance...I really don't have to say much about the pork ramen here, because the pork broth speaks for itself. If I'm not a believer of ramen, but this place was good to me, it's definitely gonna get an A with all the ramen lovers! Very small, and popular so be prepared to wait a while.",4
"I haven't been to another ramen shop better then this place yet. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you haven't tried it, this is a must. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The only crappy thing is the wait. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_During certain times (actually most of the time), there is a wait of an hour or more. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'll still give this place 5 stars. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There's a reason why people are willing to wait.",5
The best ramen in town. But it's very crowded and get ready for 1-2 hrs wait in line.,5
Very good ramen! I love the broth! I was hesitant to come here because everyone was complaining about the wait I went on a Friday was seated immediately and got my food very quick! This is now my favorite Ramen spot! Oh and the fried rice was delish!,5
"Authentic hole in the wall in little tokyo. They do real ramen and it is SO GOOD. Don't worry about the wait, the line moves quickly and food comes fast too.",5
"Daikokuya wouldn't be as popular as it is without serving good ramen, but the wait is ridiculous unless you are one of the first to arrive and line up.Frankly, I like Men Oh better for everything except maybe the noodles, which I concede is probably a little better at Daikokuya. The portions at Daikokuya are also larger, but for me (and I suspect, most people) it's a moot point because the difference represents the gap between ""quite full"" and ""quite uncomfortably full.""The extra fatty kotteri version of the broth sounds great on paper but is a little overwhelming in person. This is coming from a guy whose favorites foods are often deep-fried. The regular broth is just fine.",3
"An amazing bowl of ramen though it isn't perfect. I got the daikoku ramen with the extra rich kotteri broth. I'm a big fan of more flavorful ramen so this was perfect for me. Not many places have ramen this flavorful showing why the line was down the block even before it opened. The noodles were delightfully chewy. My main gripes are with the meat and the egg. The meat was on leaner side so wasn't as tender and fatty as I like. The egg was also overdone so the yolk wasn't as runny as is common. Still, the ramen was good enough to warrant give stars.",5
It is the SHOCKING fact that this place is run by Japanese. What an shame. I did not want to eat here but I had to and I waited for like 2 hours. My ramen noodles were very saggy and soft. No depth of broth of flavor. It was the most terrible ramen I ever had in my life.,1
"Daikokuya is one of the best Ramen i have ever had in my life. Highly recommend, however can be very long waits. Open til 1am but have waits almost the whole night (for a reason). Get the ramen combo and their fried rice is great.",5
Great food-taste is awesome and big portions! Super efficient servers! Good prices.Downside...tiny place which makes very long wait times...,4
"One of the top 10 Yelp US restaurants so had to come here when we visited LA. The wait wasn't too bad on a Thursday for lunch- around 15/20 min.The Daikoku ramen set with the with the pork cutlet bowl and salad was delicious and very reasonably priced. Tip: Order the ramen with kotteri for extra back fat flavor...sounds unappetizing, but it makes the broth tastes so much richer in flavor. Absolutely one of the best broths I've ever tasted. The spicy ramen was just OK. It's a lighter version of the kotteri daikoku ramen with spices. Def. go for the original Daikoku if you are deciding between the two!Ramen here is comparable to Japan. For the US, I don't think it can get much more authentic than this. Loved this place and will be returning if I'm ever in LA again!",4
The best ramen noodle west of Japan! or east... lol. Get the spicy noodle with extra egg and a side of pork belly appetizer.,5
"Daikokuya is where I fell in love with Tonkotsu ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_After that first bite, I asked myself, ""have I been living under a rock all these years? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_How did I ever let the taste of fresh ramen elude me?""Now, I can't go back to mediocre copycats. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Love their sizzling hot little sausages!",4
"One of the best ramen spots I've been to between the Bay Area and LA. This one loves up to the hype. Delicious broth, excellent ingredients, delicious rice bowls. If you're in the mood for ramen, come here!",5
"Daikokuya is solidly above average. But there's something about it that isn't all that memorable or appealing to me. If I don't have to wait, yes please give me some of that ramen. I think the regular ramen tastes too milky(?) to me. Getting spicy miso adds a bit of flavor I need to cut through that, but the texture of the ramen noodles leaves something to be desired as well. I'm being overly critical here, but in a sea of near universal acclaim, hopefully this helps someone. Still, this is a very spoiled perspective, and you should definitely give it a try if you haven't eaten here before. Just be prepared for a wait.",4
"The noodles are good. The soup is average, sometimes too oily, sometimes too salty. Not my favorite",4
"Summary: The complex aromas of each ingredient in the Miso Ramen complement each other so well, you kind of wonder how they did it. If you are new to the Japanese Ramen experience like I was, this place is not a bad start.Takeaways: Very popular spot means prepare for the long waiting time. Those who traveled to LA from elsewhere should take parking into account. Finding a good parking spot may take some time. There were three people among us and we decided to have an order of spicy miso and miso soup with extra noodles on the side, and we requested three bowls to share amongst us.Review:One highlight of my half-a-week long stay in California at the start of December was eating at Daikokuya. Parking looked limited but we were lucky and spotted an open space. The yellow canopy with the Japanese lettering makes it stand out from the darker colored canopies of the other shops/restaurants, and we found it easily. My friends and I waited outside for two hours during the night before getting called to a table.As I enter through the Noren I am greeted by a nice hostess, some Japanese folk songs through overhead speakers, and old newspapers and posters from Japan. We sat at the table across the booth where the busy chefs prepared the meals for the crowded restaurant. Suddenly, an enthusiastic waiter comes along who is very dextrous at iPad flipping and he proceeds to take our order: Miso ramen, Spicy Miso Ramen, some Pork, and a pitcher of beer.After about 15 minutes of waiting we received our orders, and our expectations were exceeded. ""It is soooo good,"" we said as we ate the food. My friends were joking about how my face looked, as if I was ""cry-maxing"" (you know, crying to the max). Although I denied that any tears were flowing from my eyes, I wouldn't feel ashamed for crying over a wonderful meal.If the word ""succulent"" had a picture, the pork would do a selfie; it looked and tasted the part. However, the Miso ramen's flavor was simultaneously intricate and ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_pungent. How could that be? Well, that was question I was thinking of as I was ""cry-maxing."" I sensed strong flavors in that broth that could only come from ingredients having a pungent aroma but they mesh together like a jigsaw puzzle. My usual notion of cooking is very simple: if it is too salty, add more water and vice versa, or if you leave fish out for a little too long it will smell and taste more ""fishy"" and it therefore turned ""bad."" However, the ramen changed the way I thought of food, and I realized how awesomely applicable pungent ingredients can be.I don't know. Maybe I wasn't exposed to enough good cuisine. Maybe I'm just not culinarily cultured. Maybe I am over thinking this experience. But this experience made me think of food in a different light, and I think those are good moments to be striving for. I'm sure there are other excellent ramen shops near the area, but if you are new to the experience like I was, this place is not a bad start.",5
"Came here on a Wednesday there was a wait but we waited no more than twenty minutes which was great, since everyone mentions the waits can be upwards of an hour. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food is super flavorful and the service is amazing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_My sister and I tend to drink a lot of diet coke with our meals and a servers ability to refill our beverage is a big plus. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We were never thirsty. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The portions are super generous. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I ordered the combination which came with spicy miso ramen, salad, and fried rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is more than enough food for really reasonable prices. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ They are cash only at this location but there are banks and ATMs all over Downtown so it should not be an issue.",5
"Is there a conspiracy? Why are there so many reviews calling this the best ramen around??I was so hyped up about this place having read all the great views from Boston, but after flying 8 hrs, waiting another hour in line, I'm disappointed to say it was not worth it.The ramen was 2 stars at best. There was only one option, their specialty, and it was nowhere near the places I've tried in the East Coast, especially Ippudo in NYC. The broth was not hot enough to my liking, barely luke warm. The egg was still cold in the middle. Ugh. 2 strikes. The pork was bland, the piece of fat was soft and did not taste good. Lastly, the bean sprouts were raw, and the not-so-hot broth was not enough to cook it. Another 2 strikes. The only good part was the noodle. I did like that. It was the right amount of chewiness.The other dishes here were good hence the 3 stars. The gyoza was meaty and delicious. The shredded pork bowl was also very good. That pork was definitely flavorful.If you are looking for delicious ramen, I would not recommend this place. Go to Ippudo if you can. THAT is life changing. If you are from the West Coast, too bad for you. Just kidding, make the trip to Misuwa near Santa Monica for Santouka. That is a lot better. In the end, I'm a little glad this wasn't amazing. Else I'd have to plan for a many cross-country trips to satisfy my craving. As if the frequent ramen runs to NYC aren't time consuming enough.",3
I always see the line outside this place so I thought I try. My answer was just ok... Perhaps I just came back from Japan and had good Ramen for half the price? Dunno.Shinsengumi around the corner from hereis also the same deal. Just ok...,3
Delicious food. Affordable prices. Long wait at times but we'll worth it.,5
"Walked in. The servers did not greet. Typical asian owned restaurant. Luckily there was a sign that says ""please wait to be seated"" so i did. The place was very small like a hallway with a bar on the side and few booths. Once i got seated, my waitress left quickly. So i asked another waitress to take my order, but she said ""i dont take orders"". Clearly she just took someones order. Hmmm anyways, I expected the ramen to be awesome due to the reviews on yelp but i got my hopes up. The broth was plain (i ordered spicy miso ramen). It was not spicy, even though i poured half of the hot spice in. *i love spicy food*. Ramen came with salad bowl and a choice of variety of meats. Very proportional. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ I ordered a teriyaki bowl and that tasted very sweet and good on top of rice. The reason why i gave it a 2 stars is because i dont like their ramen. I dont know what the hype is about considering that i am a ramen-fanatic.",2
"Delicious!!! i tried the Spicy Miso ramen and the Roasted Pork Slices, definitely will be coming back, the only think thats kind of a downers is that its a tiny little ramen house so the wait time was a little long. so if you're planning on coming here, then come early!!!",4
"The wait was about 30 minutes for a party of 4 on a Thursday for lunch. There's convenient meter parking in front of the restaurant. When you go inside, there will be a list for you to write down your name and number in your party. If you want, you can probably walk around the area a little but make sure you come back before your number is called! Otherwise, they'll just skip your number. For the food...daikokuya ramen was quite good--mainly because of the tender pork and the perfectly cooked egg. There are two options for ramen...original daikokuya ramen or spicy version. Prices are reasonable for the huge bowl of ramen they give you. For a few dollars more, you can get a combo with ramen plus other dishes such as katsu + rice. Overall, yummy ramen! I'll be back for more next time I visit LA!",5
Love this place! Just a little tip...get there at 10:30am if you're not trying to wait in a line. It's just that good ;),5
"I really like Daikokuya. I ordered the original ramen that everyone usually gets. The noodles and the soup was perfect together. I really like the poach egg and the meat they served. The service was good and the food came out just in time. The only thing I didn't like was that they forget to give us water until the end of our meal. Overall, the food was good.",5
"In addition to their unbeatable ramen broth, GET THE GREASY FRIED RICE. secretly the best item on their menu, tbh. I usually get a combo so i have a some ramen and some fried rice both left over for consumption at a later time. mmm. The lines are ridiculously long and they don't take reservations so my recommendation is to put in your name, then go across the street to Nirvana for a drink (or Far Bar if you're looking for atmosphere) or two, or roam Little Tokyo and get some Japanese street food or mochi ice cream, before coming back about 20 mins prior to the end of their estimated wait times. Another secret is to come here way later, within an hour of closing time, for much shorter waits. Bonus is that the later it gets, the richer the ramen broth since it's been stewing literally all day. ;)",5
What can I say? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Noodles with great texture and the fattiest broth imaginable....a staple in my cycling diet. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Try the Pork fried rice too.,5
"Only been here many times, but actually eating here? Once.Why? Because the wait is ridiculous. It kind of a chore to get to, parking isnt exactly easy to find. Sometimes I wonder why people keep coming back.Don't get me wrong, I love daikokuya's ramen, but its not worth going through all that to get! The MPK locations suits me better. It doesn't taste any different from the original. The service isn't anything to rave about. I get what I want with less effort. And that makes me happy.I had expected a 30min + waiting time. So I quickly looked up a nearby bar to get my drink on(with my yelp app of course!). Found one right across the street. Had a beer and watched some people act a fool with karaoke, I took care of the tab and started to head back to the restaurant. And as expected we came back with 1 name before us. I was amazed at how perfectly everything was timed.Got seated, ordered the ramen with the unagi/roasted ell bowl. And a side of tuna sashimi. The ramen was good as expected. The unagi was spot on. And the tuna was fresh. I did enjoy my meal. Came about to be about $30ish. Not sure if I would come back though. The service at the arcadia location is like 10 times faster than this location, because you dont have to wait to be seated. The MPK location is usually better for the 626 locals for myself who want the more authentic dining experience. And its less crowded than the Little Tokyo location. Unless I was dying to have ramen and was stuck in LT, I wouldnt come to this location.",2
"Never thought I would ever wait an hour in line for ramen, but I just had to finally give this place a try. And I think the ramen was indeed excellent, but I liked the ambiance even better, the props that make you feel like you are in downtown Tokyo is a really nice touch. Anyway avoid this place on the weekends since the wait is just ridiculous since it's a tiny place with only about 20 seats.",5
"What I love more than the food, and more than the SALAD DRESSING, is this ONE WAITER who is really cool and funny. I don't know his name, but he wears glasses and is literally working there all the time",5
"Meh...If you want to drink a bowl of pork fat, then I guess Daikokuya is the place for you. In fact, get the kotteri (cloudy and rich) ramen where it's literally a bowl of ramen with chunks of fucking fat floating around. If you want a sure fire way of dying after a meal then order Daikokuya's kotteri ramen because you are guaranteed a heart attack from this dish because fat is fat no matter what you call it. I mean kurobuta and black pork sounds great, but at the end of the day you are eating pig fat soup. When it comes to Japanese ramen, I guess I'm more of an assari (light and clear) enthusiast, which explains why I have an affinity for plain shio (salt) ramen and shoyu (soy sauce) ramen because I prefer ramen broth that isn't so damn dense. In fact, even when cooking ramen at home I forbid anyone from adding eggs to my broth because I like my shit clean and pure... ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_like me. I mean you are what you eat, right? RIGHT!But seriously, what disappoints about Daikokuya is that they only offer one type of ramen: pork fat ramen or uber pork fat ramen. And sadly, I'm just not a fan like all the other 3,000 bandwagon followers. And guess what? Because Daikokuya is in the tourist trap of a place we call Little Tokyo (where Japanese people do not even live because the real Japantown is in the South Bay), you will have to wait a fucking long ass time to eat overrated food. Other Food OptionsBesides their fatty ramen, Daikokuya offers rice bowls with tonkatsu (deep-fried pork cutlet) or tuna sashimi, fried rice, and other side dishes like a weird salad.Tonkatsu - Average and not spectacularTuna Sashimi - Don't fucking order sashimi from a non-sushi restaurant Fried Rice - The best thing I had at DaikokuyaWeird Salad - Let's just say that I did not appreciate the mayonnaise/pink slime dressing-----------------------------So, if you really want to try delicious umami Japanese ramen, then you must check out Santouka inside the Mitsuwa Market in Torrance (aka Big Tokyo). *BTW, Yelp, are you fucking serious? How is Daikokuya a 2011 top ten US Yelp Restaurant? SMH... Un-fucking-believable...",2
"The ramen is just OK, since the waiting time is so long, I think you should consider if it's worth before your decided to wait for an hour.",3
"Went here this past Saturday and was so glad we beat the lunch rush since other yelpers have mentioned the 1-2+ hour wait times. Got there right when they opened and scored seats at the bar. Ordered their Daikoku ramen bowl with extra back fat aka ""kotteri"" flavor. Sounds gross, but was super tasty. Everything about it was fantastic, however I kept comparing it to Santouka. Santouka's broth is much more flavorful! I remember slurping up every single last drop of soup there, while I barely finished half of the broth at Daikokuya. Also, there were only two pieces of meat in my bowl...Santouka gave me a whole plateful of meat. Yum.If I didn't have Santouka to compare this place to, I'd give it 5 stars. The service was good, food came out quick and and it WAS delicious. I tried some of the husband's salad (that dressing is crazy good!!) and his fried rice (WOW! want more now!), which he got as a combo with his ramen. Such a good deal for less than $13 or so.Parking was definitely a nightmare.. We ended up paying $6.50 to park in a nearby lot. It was all day parking though, so we took advantage of that and hung out at Japanese Village.",4
"Protip: go by yourselfwalk in, sign your name,basically cut that 40 minute wait time to 5because its so much easier to seat a single person,they will place you in front of the line.then steal some chumps girlfriend on the way out cause hes had her waiting for 40 minutes outside for some fucking ramen.",4
"Just like so many other people, I LOVE the ramen here. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I got the broth ""kotteri style"" which just means it's a little fattier and richer (just the way I like it!). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I love that the broth is rich without being salty, and I love that they have grated garlic at the table for you to add to the dish. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Me and my BF both took a heaping spoonful of that good stuff.Noodles were cooked perfectly, the egg was delicious, but what put it over the top was their pulled pork donburi. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was soooo good! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I absolutely loved every bite of it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It totally kicked Santouka's pork rice bowl's butt!Yes, I hate the wait time too, but I can't blame the restaurant for that. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_As impatient as I am, I'm wlling to make an exception for this place.... good food sometimes requires patience. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'm working on that.",5
"Love this place! For LA ramen, i like it here. The combination deal is pretty awesome. i normally get the daikoku ramen. egg is always cooked perfect, and the pork is yumm... the ramen is pretty simple, nothing flashy, just a very good classic dish.there may be a wait, but if you don't mind sitting at the bar, that wait might be a little shorter.",4
"BEST RAMEN PLACE in L.A.!! Small restaurant, usually a wait (can be up to about an hour, depending on the time when you go there) but well worth it.I usually get their combination which I LOVE: Daikokuya Ramen + small shredded pork bowl (you can select from a variety of bowls or fried rice) + a salad (thinly sliced cabbage with a wonderfully delish dressing)...and a side gyoza.Also, my favorite spot for Hiyashi Chu-Ka (cold noodle) when in season. MmmMmm.Meter parking on the streets or parking structures nearby.",5
Definitely still one of the best ramen places in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But the surplus of ramen places in the south land leaves me less likely to wait in this often very long line. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Pork and rice bowl plus tonkatsu ramen = happy me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ One of the many places on the very long list of must try ramen places.,3
"Waited for a table for over an hour but it was well worth it. Delicious, authentic ramen with such a friendly staff. We had the Daikokuya Ramen and it was so amazing. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Can't wait to go back. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_If you want the best, come here.",5
"i finally got the chance to dine here after hearing and reading all the hype and reviews. this visit was totally not planned as i was actually craving for some sushi or chinese food. we came to little tokyo hoping to find some good happy hour so we wouldnt have to spend too much but ended up stopping at a bar for a drink while we ""yelped"" for nearby eateries. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_it was pouring rain out and i was cold and getting irritated that nothing i was reading on yelp caught my eye. finally, he said ""lets just go to daikokuya next door"". finally, it was decided. we knew it was cash only so we stopped at an ATM to get cash out. we waited about 30 minutes before we finally got seated at the bar area...which normally i would pass on and wait til a booth opened up but on this night, it was so cold that i didnt mind sitting so close to the steaming pots. it helped warm me up.looking at the menu, i was expecting a big list of ramen variety (ie foo foo tei). but i only saw two types of ramen. so i just went with the flow and ordered the regular ramen and shredded pork bowl combo (like most yelpers recommended). for $11.95 i was surprise that the bowl of ramen was so big that by the time i was done with all the fillings of the ramen (skipping on most of the noodles), i barely had enough room to eat my shredded pork rice bowl! even the shredded cabbage salad was filled all the way to the top of the bowl. he ordered the combo with pork cutlet with egg and even that was tasty.all the hype was true. i've been to other ramen joints where i've actually walked out still hungry. but this place is legit. but i REALLY.....REALLY.....despise cash only places. the long wait is not a rumor, expect itt. and if you dont respond when they call your number, they WILL skip you rather quickly.",4
Trying this famous ramen. The wait for our table was an hour. The place is super crowded and small. Our server was nice and quick. We ordered ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_miso ramen and the daikokuya ramen. It was not great but good. The chasu is very soft and tasteful. Portion is enough to fill you. Also ordered the takoyaki. I tasted better takoyaki before. We were eating in a hurry because we feel so bad for the other customer waiting outside in the cold.,4
"Finally was able to make a trip to LA to try this place out. We parked on the street since it was Sunday and metered parking is free. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Arrived around 6pm and there was already a group of people waiting outside. We signed in and explored the stores on the street and came back to wait some more. Since we were kind of early we ended up only waiting around 30 minutes, which isn't too bad at all.Ordered the Daikoku ramen and my boyfriend ordered the Daikoku combo with the salad and fried rice. The salad was more of a cole slaw than salad since they used shredded cabbage and a mayo based sauce but it was delicious. The dressing was what definitely made it taste so amazing though! The fried rice was good as well and they use the same pork that is in the ramen in the fried rice, yumm. When the ramen arrived I was pretty surprised cause the bowl was HUGE, topped with bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, tons of scallions and a whole egg. Ohh and if you like a little kick to your ramen you can ask the waitress for the chili oil. The chili oil they have here is a lot spicier that most places though, so beware!! I took a spoonful of broth with chili oil and almost choked from the spiciness lol. The broth is intensely flavorful where I had to take sips of water after I had some of the broth. The noodles weren't my favorite (I prefer firmer noodles), but the pork was so tender that they melt in your mouth. The egg wasn't my favorite either since it was a bit raw inside and I don't really like runny yolks but perfect for my boyfriend since he loves it. I was pretty surprised I even finished the whole bowl but I had major food coma afterwards and felt like my stomach was going to explode from all the food.I think one downside for me is that they don't have spicy miso because I usually order the spicy miso ramen because I like a little kick of spiciness in my ramen. Overall, the ramen here is good, but I would prefer to stick with the ramen places in OC that are closer to me that are just as good!",4
Love this food and look forward to eating here when I get the chance. The pork bowl is to die for and the little salad makes me happy.,5
"When I found out Daikokuya was LA's #1 Ramen shop, I had to give this place a try. Of course, we ordered the famous Daikokuya ramen. It came huge pile of green onions (sweet!), a couple pieces of meat (more than other ramen shops I've been to), a whole soft-boiled egg (most places only give half an egg), lots of noodles and bean sprouts. The broth was fresh and perfectly marinated. The atmosphere is very laidback, like any ordinary ramen joint in Japan. Service was quick and hospitable. But, if you're like me and cannot taste the difference between ramens, I would not recommend coming here to wait 45min-1hour to be seated and paying 25% more for some ""famous ramen"".",4
"Perfect -- even moreso at 1:30 a.m. after your friend's wild 30th birthday party. As a native Houstonian, I'm accustomed to eating piping hot Asian soup 365 days a year, so it didn't matter that it was August. This ramen is incredible, and I'd eat it sitting outside in New Orleans in July. It's that good. The noodle serving is generous, which is crucial because you want to finish every drop of the homemade broth. Pork belly was perfectly cooked, and the whole hard-boiled egg was a little weird but the extra protein I needed after a night out in LA.",5
"I came here with my husband and my 2 yr old son. We have been wanting to check out Little Tokyo and to try something that wasn't Sushi. We did a little bit of searching and found this place. Has great reviews so we came.We came in right at noon on a Saturday. The place was pretty small and packed. There was a 40 minute wait as well. You have to sign yourself in and take note of your number as that is how they call you in. I recommend waiting right by the door if there are no seats available on the inside. Otherwise you may miss hearing your number. They only call it twice within 1 or 2 seconds with a somewhat quiet voice. If you don't respond they will move right along to the next person. Anyways, on to the review :)So I ordered the Daikokuya Ramen with the half chicken and egg rice bowl combination to share with my son and my husband ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen, My husband had never tried Tonkatsu (Japanese style panko breaded deep fried pork) so we ordered that as well.Everything was fantastic.I'm usually underwhelmed with ramen. I do crave it every once in a while but that's why I buy packs from the store and make the instant ones at home. HOWEVER... This place definitely has really great quality noodles and broth. The broth was super porky but not greasy. It was definitely a very hearty soup. The boiled egg that came with it was cooked perfectly. My husband HATES boiled eggs so I looked over into his bowl to grab his.. but apparently I was too slow... that was the first thing he ate and he wanted more. lol My husband murdered his Spicy Miso Ramen. It was pretty good. I actually preferred the Daikokuya bowl but ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_the other was delicious as well. Tonkatsu was good. Nothing to scream about tho.I think the best part of this meal however was my sons rice bowl. Good Lord in Heaven. :)As with many Asian Americans in Southern California, I grew up with the beefy goodness of Yoshinoya's beef bowls. I'm a huge fan of Yoshinoya despite what many people who have tried it as adults have to say about it. HOWEVER... and I say this with a heavy heart.. This place puts Yoshinoya to shame. I would wait an hour just to come here and have a full on rice bowl. This chicken and egg rice bowl my son had was absolutely delicious. There were simple pieces of chicken meat with a half cooked egg on top. You mix it up with the rice and you notice that there is some of that hearty pork ramen broth on the bottom. Good Lord. You mix the whole thing up.. (or at least I did.. wanted the egg to cook all the way for my son :)) and it was still hot so the egg finished cooking in there. Normally I eat these bowls with ginger... but then again it wasn't my food. I kept sneaking spoonfuls away from my son. He normally doesn't mind when I do this but that day... he definitely voiced his whiny opinion. hahahaI must return and order me some of that good Japanese rice bowls. One for mom and a separate one for the kid. FREAKING DELICIOUS! I must return. Drooling atm. :P",5
Still haven't found better ramen in LA. Try the back-fat ramen and don't forget some green tea!,5
"First of all.. there's a sign on the door that says ""New location opened in Monterey Park. (111 N. Atlantic Blvd Ste 241, Monterey Park, CA)""In addition there are two more locations. 1) 2975 Harbor Blvd, Costa Mesa, CA 92626 and 2) 15827 E. Gale Ave, Hacienda Heights, CA 91745Also, they are No longer taking to-go orders.Anyway, I went here with Frank M this weekend since we were in the area. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It had just started raining, and it was already dinner time. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Perfect for ramen! We get there, and there's a sign in sheet on the other side of the door, on a little chair. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There are about 3 or 4 groups ahead of us. We waited around for 10-15 minutes before being called. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Niceee. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We also got one of the booths instead of the counters. :)I got the combination Daikoku Ramen with a small bowl of Pork Cutlet bowl. $11.50 (Also comes with a salad). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The salad was yummy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Although It might be because there is mayonnaise in it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not sure. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_A few minutes later, the small bowl of Pork Cutlet comes out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's pretty good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I thought about getting the Shredded Pork, but got the Pork Cutlet instead. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I think it's a pretty good deal considering Daikoku Ramen is already $8.50! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You only pay $3 more for the extra bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen came out last. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've never had any other ramen before except for Cup O Noodles Ramen.. so I guess I'd have to say that this is the best Ramen I've ever had. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_(But it doesn't mean much). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Also, these bowls are HUGE. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The bowls are about the size of a salad bowl. I didn't finish half of all the food brought out, so I took the ramen and Pork Cutlet bowl to-go. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Once at home, I got hungry again and had some more of the Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It tasted even better at home. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Although.. I left it in the fridge, and the soup solidified. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not sure if it's because of all the fat that's in it.. I'd rather not think about it. ;) Anyway, the food was good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The place is a little dirty.. and small, but I would probably go back here.",4
"Lately, my boyfriend and I have been on a ramen frenzy! We found out about Daikokuya through fellow yelpers and decided to give it a try. We were lucky enough to go on a perfect day and time (Friday, 5:00 pm) where the wait to be seated was a mere 10 minutes. My bf had the Daikokuya and I decided to try the spicy miso ramen, both were equally delicious. The amount of food given is well worth the price. The dishes here are rather large and I usually tend to leave a little food behind for my bf to tackle. However, I enjoyed it so much that I ate the entire bowl of ramen! The amount of heat in my soup was perfect - not to spicy, but enough to give me a sniffle here and there. My favorite thing was the pork belly, it was so tender, so full of flavor and absolutely delectable! The only complaint I have is that the air circulation is not the greatest. I found myself burning up from the heat of the soup combined with the hot air inside this small place. I thought I was the only one, but my bf was sweating bullets from the heat. If it wasn't for the hot air, I would have given this place 5 stars.",4
"Super reasonable with prices, the wait is kind of long but 100% worth it because the food is awesome. Very authentic",4
"This is one of our favorite ramen shops in the US and very delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I'm not to found of the fact that they added a 15% gratuity to our bill when we are a family of 5. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Not just for this simple fact but come on one of my children had to sit on a round cold metal seat in the middle of the restaurant because space is limited. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Did I also mention the fact that he got hit a couple of times by customers that bumped into him on their way in/or out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Does anyone else had this happened to them?",3
"Ever since I tried tsukemen at Tsujita, I've been hooked on this style of ramen. Having raved so much about tsukemen to my friends, everyone in my party had high expectations, and I'm glad to say that we were all really satisfied with Daikokuya's version of tsukemen. Broth is flavorful, and a tad hotter than Tsujita, which i thought could've been a bit hotter. I wish the egg could've been more gooey, but still enjoyable. One star deducted for how hot it was inside the place. They had fans but not sure why they weren't turned on. Tsukemen is definitely a fun and interesting way to eat ramen, especially in this summer heat. This style keeps your noodle from being too soggy sitting in the broth.",4
"Tiny, hole in the wall. the wait is long because the spot is very small only 6 booths and a handful of bar stools. We went at closing on a weeknight and waited about 15 mins for a seat. Metered parking is enforced from 8am-8pm. Best deal is to get the combo, for $12.95 you get a salad, pork rice bowl &amp; house ramen! The house ramen alone is $8.95. They serve fountain coke with refills, sounds silly but this is not normal for small Asian restaurants! ps. cash only",4
"Definitely one of the best ramen restaurants I've been to. My friend and I was in LA for the weekend and decided to give this place a try because of the amount of reviews it has. But without a doubt this place really lived up to the hype. We got there around 3:00pm on a Tuesday and the place was already packed. The restaurant itself is kind of small and parking may be difficult since its all meter parking. However the wait for us wasnt too bad, my friend and I only waited around 15-20 minutes before getting seated. We ordered the classic Daikokuya ramen (with chili oil on the side) and the spicy miso ramen and it was absolutely delicious. The broth for both bowls had amazing flavors and the noodles were cooked perfectly. They also had garlic, red ginger, and hot chilli oil on the side to spice it up a bit- major bonus compared to most ramen places. Their meat was amazing. The pork was nice and tender and just melts in your mouth, we just wished they put more in the bowl. The egg was cooked to perfection, soft boil in the inside! Will defintely come back next time I'm in LA. I'd love to try their small rice bowls on the side too! Only downside, I was sitting at the bar area and whiel i was eating, a cockroach came crawling out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Majorly unappetizing, even though Im sure almost all restaurants have them....",4
"Besides the long wait (an hour or more), there's nothing much bad about it. Food was great and staff were responsive too. :)",4
"By far the best ramen I have ever had!! The wait to be seated was a little long but it was definitely worth the wait, I can understand why they are always packed with customer. The broth and noodles are so good and the egg is amazing as well, I live pretty far from little Tokyo but I always try to stop when I am in the area. I definitely recommend this place!!",5
"Bento Box is bomb. Ramen is also pretty good, I'm a fan of less fatty broths, like chicken instead of pork, but they only have one option here. The noodles are really good though, so it kind of makes up for it. The wait can get long if you don't go early, but ""the longer the wait, the better the food"" is my motto.",4
"eversince my friend brought us here, i might say they had the best ramen in town.the broth is tasty n noone had ever imitate it, jus the right saltiness herbs n spices, great combination of salt soy sauce, miso n tonkotsu..the noodles are cooked right,not saggy.they're selling also their dressing for salad $6/bottle n $4.50 for refill.cash only guys",4
"I remember about a year ago trying to come here was a nightmare because the line was horrendous! Around 7:15pm on a Wednesday night, the wait for three people was minimal.Two of us ordered the Daikoku Ramen, while another ordered the Daikoku Ramen with added pork fat plus small fried rice combination. We also shared pork &amp; vegetable gyoza as a starter. The gyoza are not the typical crescent moon shape, but instead they are rectangular. Regardless of its shape, they were still good. The ramen was delicious and I have to say that I like Daikokuya better than Orochon. I liked this broth better. It was richer, but it was still too salty for me. Along with the al-dente ramen, there was pork, soft boiled egg, bean sprouts and a sprinkling of green onions. The fried rice was also good. It seems like a weird combination of rice and ramen, but it worked out fine. The fried rice came with corn &amp; pork and was good too. We were extremely full and took home more than half our meal!Yay, I get to finally check off Daikokya off my ""Must Eat"" list after living in LA for two years!",4
"My date and I tried this on recommendation from other yelpers. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_By all accounts, it's one of the best ramen we've ever tasted. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We each had a bowl of the house special, Daikoku Ramen, regular and spicy. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The regular was good but we both agreed the spicy outperformed. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The spiciness as served was well balanced against the richness of the soup base. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodle was al dente and vegetables were clean and fresh. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The egg was tasty except that the center was cool, which was a bit unusual. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The yolk also has a translucent appearance; we were curious as to the process that created it but did not ask given the busy state of the place at the time.At 1:10PM on a Sat, the wait for us was 20 mins. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Though the place was small, and warm, the waitresses worked diligently, processed everyone in an orderly and calm fashion, and were always polite. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We also ordered a pitcher of Kirin on draft at an unbeatable price of $11! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was perfect for a hot summer day, and for sitting by three large pots of boiling liquid, but a bit too much for two nonetheless. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Luckily we found a neighbor patron who happily helped out. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We also learned that our beer friend is a typical die-hard fan of Daikokuya; living in Glendora did not stop him from making the trek to Little Tokyo (via metro!) just to savor that special broth.This experience has inspired us to seek out and try their other shops, two of which are closer to home: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Monterey Park and Arcadia.",4
"The ramen is so good and the service is always fast and friendly. This review is purely for the ramen, I haven't tried anything else.",5
"Best ramen I've ever had. I got the daikoku ramen and my husband and I shared gyoza, which was also very good. We went early afternoon on a Friday so it wasn't busy.",5
"Truly amazing place and Yelpers got all the reviews perfectly -- thank you! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There are many issues with the place (chaotic, long wait, cleanliness) but you forget all that the minute you take a sip of the broth. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is the milkiest, most flavorful soup broth I've ever tasted and perfectly complimented with just the perfect amount of noodles, bits of meats and vegetables. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Service is excellent and attentive and the turnover is fast. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You may to wait an hour plus to be seated but once you are the food is out in 10 mins. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I've had ramen all over the place and this is among (if not the best) I've ever had ... if you're ever in NYC -- skip the NYC places and try Menya Sandaime in Fort Lee ... hand cut noodles and the pork belly is superb.",5
"First of all... 3200 reviews? After seeing the yelp reviews and hearing repeatedly about backfat broth from my bf, I knew I had to come here.I arrived with some friends at around 6pm on a Sunday evening. We didn't have to wait long--maybe about 15 min--before we were seated. This place in Little Tokyo is small, packed, and cozy.I was super impressed that each bowl of tsukemen was only $8! I had the backfat broth (of course). The flavors were delicious, perfectly salty, and the backfat added the right amount of comfort. (Note: it will congeal -- keep mixing.) The meat melted like butter in my mouth.At the end, I just wanted to keep eating and enjoy my company, but I was stuffed and had to pass along part of my meal to the guys at the table. It was definitely the better tsukemen experience I had in LA when I visited. YUM.",5
"This place started my love for Ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is rich and creamy, their combo options are always a crowd pleaser, and the gyoza goes with everything. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Only complaint is that there is always a wait to get into this place!",5
"Words aren't enough to describe the deliciousness of this ramen. I warn you now, you're going to eat yourself into a food coma. A bowl of spicy miso ramen is the size of your head and the flavor is even bigger. I sprung for the combo with a cabbage salad and shredded pork bowl. My gut now sticks out farther than my chest. Be prepared to wait to be seated. The chairs at the bar are not even self serve. I waited about thirty minutes on a Tuesday night. When you walk in, write your own name down on the clip board. I waited for someone to come to the front and another customer wrote his name down ahead of me. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They're cash only... but this is LA. How can you not carry any cash? You need cash to park anywhere or to buy a bacon wrapped hot dog. So why not pony up some greenbacks for some top notch Japanese food. I'll tell you one thing that Little Tokyo does better than the rest of downtown LA... they keep the bums out. It doesn't reek of urine and no one asks you for change.",5
"IMA in LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I visited LA for a week last month.I visited Daikokuya because it was supposed to be the standard bearer for LA ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_NY fans of Ippudo, Chuko, Totto, really any top 10 ramen places better stay away. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The vibe is fine, the wait is long, but the real issue is that the broth lacks depth, the meat was overcooked, and I hardly got any flavor from it at all. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Big disappointment.",2
"The ramen here is excellent. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_However, the wait is proportionally long and this isn't some cheapie instant ramen ($9/bowl). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Take note that your wait and monetary sacrifice is going to be worth it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_This place uses quality ingredients and the chefs here are somewhat perfectionists- I saw the guy who boils noodles throw away a whole box of noodles because they were broken or too dry. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth here is amazing and keep in mind the pork is meant to be fatty!! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The standard ramen also includes an egg and some mountain veggies so tell the waiters ahead of time if you're a picky eater. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Lastly, you may be wondering why the 4 stars if this is such an amazing place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food is indeed quite good but the cleanliness of this restaurant is a little lacking.",4
"OMG B.E.S.T. TONKATSU RAMEN EVER! Despite the 1.5 hour wait at midnight?? If I lived in LA, I would definitely come here really often, but too bad I'm not a local! The broth, ramen, and pork were all perfect! Though some may say that the broth may be too fatty because it tends to solidify by the end of your meal (haha....) But if you're not drinking all of the broth, you should be fine.. for now.",5
"Visiting Tokyo town since we had time to kill on a sunny Monday afternoon. We came across this restaurant via yelped. My lady is a foodie, and she loves to try different ramen noodles place. We saw that this place had plenty reviews and we thought why not lets give it a shot.Be aware, the wait is very, very long. Perhaps at least a 30 minute wait. It is a very small noodle house, but I guarantee you it is worth the wait. The noodle was a good portion for what it consisted of. Egg noodle, large boiled egg, ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_and yummy, tasty soup base. Also came with just enough of pork. I got a small bowl of chicken teriyaki, and boy was it good. The chicken was fresh, and the way it was prepared was delicious. I love the fast service. They get you in and out. I definitely recommend this place if you are craving for ramen noodle.",5
"I am not a ramen fan like most of my close friends. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's usually the last thing on my mind and I cringe when my friends suggest it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Hopefully I don't offend anyone but I'd much rather throw in an egg, meat and some veggies to my Mama noodles at home! =XHowever, Daikokuya changed all that! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Well, I wouldn't call myself a ramen fan just yet but after multiple attempts at trying to get my girlfriends to choose a different venue, I was very glad we ended up dining at Daikokuya! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I was afraid it was all hype from UCLA students but it lived up to my expectations! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It probably helped that I didn't have to wait too long in line. We arrived at 10:45am, barely making the first in line. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_By opening time, 11am, there were over a dozen people in line! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We ordered the regular special and the spicy one, all combos with the gyoza, tuna sashimi, fried rice and shredded pork. The tuna pretty much melts in your mouth, leaving you to beg for more. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Too bad we had a ton of food already. The fried rice was my next favorite of all the sides, it had that taste I love like it was cooked off a really aged pan. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_As for the ramen, although I usually prefer spicy food, I'd have to say I enjoyed the regular broth much more than the spicy one. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The noodles were of the perfect consistency and omg, the egg. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The best part!!!If it were for ramen alone, I'd probably think one try was good enough and that I wouldn't be sad if I never came back because I got to try it once. However, considering how much I enjoyed all the sides with the ramen together, I'd definitely make a future lunch date out of Daikokuya!",4
"Do I think there's any reason to read this review when, oh you know, there's 3972 OTHER REVIEWS YOU CAN READ ON DAIKOKUYA?!?! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Probably not; but I do want to leave my cyber footprint on here.I went to the preeminent location, where the legendary wait has people readjusting their entire day's schedule just to grace one of their seats. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_You may even have to settle for a bar seat, and talk side-by-side with your dining mates. No matter; chances are your head will be in a downward dog position carefully focusing on the guided maneuver of your hand to your mouth with non-stop ramen.Whether you're by yourself, with a date, or a small group of people, make sure to let everyone know that it's cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Because I had to be a pal and pay for my female friend, who I was hoping didn't take this as a date.All-in-all, my palate isn't too refined to say that this ramen is heads and shoulders better than most other place's ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's not worth the insane wait to get in. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I really like it, though, and I could see myself coming back again.- Will",4
Just ok. I have definitely had better ramen. The yelp reviews have hyped this place up a little more than the respect it should get. Honestly I loved their fried rice but their ramen was just ok.,3
Discovered this place from a visiting Aussie. I can't tell you how much I adore this restaurant. There is always a significant wait of 40-60 minutes. It looks like a hole in the wall but it is a must place to eat. The shredded duck bowl along with a large bowl of ramen with the added duck fat is orgasmic. The dressing on a basic cabbage salad is to die for. My friend and I each bought their salad dressing. Once you put your name on the list go shopping across the street. There are a lot of cute shops to kill time. You won't loose your spot if you get back late.,5
"I felt the need to write this review after seeing ever growing crowds in front of Daikokuya in recent years. Ok, so here comes my rant.I started going to Daikokuya more than 15 years ago back in my college days. Back then it was the best bowl of ramen in Little Tokyo. Maybe even in all of Los Angeles. There was rarely a time when I'd have to wait more than 10-15 minutes for a table and single seating was always available at the counter. I would never have to wait outside. Tonkotsu, yum. Crushed garlic, yum. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ Fast forward to today. I've gotten a little bit older and wiser. My tastes have matured a bit. I've had the opportunity to eat different types of ramen in Japan and at numerous other ramen restaurants that have opened in and around Los Angeles over the past 15 years. Enter Yelp and social media where good-intentioned folks (who's ramen experience probably don't go beyond Top Ramen and Cup-o-Noodles) declare that Daikokuya is ""OMG THE BEST FREAKIN EPIC RAMEN EVER SH*T IN MY PANTS DELICIOUS!!!!"" Crowds gather. The masses come like mindless lemmings. Waits go up to 1 hr, 2 hrs for a table. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Yes, Daikokuya's ramen is good. But due to overwhelming (and unwarranted) 5-star Yelp reviews and the unbelievably long wait times and ridiculous crowds there these days, it has become very OVERRATED. Everytime I see the crowds in front of Daikokuya, I want to yell out to them, ""PEOPLE, this place is overrated!!! Do not listen to Yelp! Do yourself all a favor and try ShinSenGumi or Men-Oh ramen, just down the street."" The broth at those restaurants (ShinSenGumi - customizable Hakata-style tonkotsu broth, Men-Oh - Tokushima pork broth) are a little more subtle and complex, in my opinion, than Daikokuya's overly heavy pork fat broth. Or be a little more open minded and try the fresh, hand-made udon noodles at Marugame Monzo next door. You'll thank me for it.Or actually, don't go to those places. It'll keep the wait times down for me.Rameniac pretty much sums it up in his 2007 review of Daikokuya here: ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_rameniac.com/reviews/comÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_Also, WHY? WHY? WHY? do people ever order SPICY RAMEN??? Or add hot sauce/Siracha to their ramen?? Dear God!!! If you want spicy noodles, go get some Szechuan dandan noodles, not ramen!",3
"This is my favorite ramen place in Little Tokyo, if not in all of Los Angeles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I usually order Daikoku Ramen (usually a 1/2 order unless I'm hungry). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Most often than not, there will be a wait and if you want to minimize your wait time it's best to come with no more than two people.The Daikoku Ramen is delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's good for lunch or dinner (and it would probably be just as good for breakfast). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is the star for me of this place. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It's salty and hearty and I wish I could drink it if it wasn't so sodium laden (probably not the best place for those watching their sodium intake). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I also love the soft boiled egg that comes with the ramen with the perfectly soft golden yolk.For those that need just more than ramen, the gyoza is pretty decent (but oily and come in an unusual rectangular shape) and the fried rice is also delicious as well.Remember it's polite to slurp your noodles!",5
"If you're a ramen fan and in LA, this ramen shop is the place to go! I always order the daikoku kotteri ramen then add crush garlic that they have on the table. So good! Btw, it's cash only and there's always a wait.",5
"Ive been here a couple more times now and i think the ramen is pretty average, it just doesnt really stand out to me. It is delicious dont get me wrong but i think some of the things that makes this place a successful business is there combinations like their chasu bowls, chicken bowls and even their salad is very awesome.",3
"The food here is awesome! Portion size was a lot!!! A lot of deliciousness!! :) The service was nothing short of great , I would recommend the establishment time and time again. The only con of this location is that it is smaller so get there a little early because they are always busy and there is usually a 15-30 min wait. But again this place is great",4
"How do you know you've tasted some good ramen noodles? When you don't have to add any seasonings to the noodles! Waited 40 mins, and was seated by a cute, friendly waitress that was attentive to our requests. Hands down in my opinion the best ramen I've ever tasted, maybe because I'm in the Bay Area and there are not a lot of ramen noodle joints. Short story the food was excellent, I gave the waitress a tip and she bowed and said something in Japanese, then I was like whattt? Good experience, a restaurant I wouldn't mind returning too",5
"Disappointment &amp; Overrated. First time @ this place. Heard &amp; read so many great things about their ramen. Unfortunately this place didn't live up to the hype. Waited an hour for a party of 3. We all ordered the daikokuya ramen bowl which didn't really look like the picture in the menu. My bowl was all noodles, hardly any meat, a few vegetables &amp; 1 bamboo shoot. Not at all what I was expecting. The soup was alright, not much taste to it. However, we did order a gyoza &amp; that was the best gyoza I've ever had. Not worth the wait. Price is ok but wouldn't eat here again.",2
"I think I've caught the ramen bug.This is my second ramen house I've been to in the month of October and I really enjoyed this one better. I think it was mostly the broth that made it so much more enjoyable. I didn't think it was too salty either.I also try and avoid eating pork belly because I don't like the taste of fat in my mouth, but this was a different story. This fat tasted different and didn't have that oily taste that I'm used to.If I could, I would return here. However, for a table for three on a Thursday evening around 8 p.m, we waited about an hour for our table. But for this reason, I might not. I'm sure I can find another place with just as good ramen, and less wait time. Keep in mind! It's cash only!",3
"Been convinced to eat here many times by friends even though I think place is too hyped up.Expect a wait when you come whether its for lunch or dinner. Structure parking is not validated since this ramen place isn't in the Tokyo Plaza..As for the ramen, the broth is very flavored I must admit, but the noodles taste just like another other place. For big stomachs, the portion would be perfect because they do give you a generous portion of ingredients.",3
"Daikokuya is one of the top ramen houses in L.A. They currently have 5 locations in Southern California. Their original shop is in Little Tokyo is a storefront on First street and is located in an old, non-descript brick building. They have an unmistakable, bright yellow awning with Daikokuya signage prominently displayed. The restaurant is very small, long and narrow, with 8 (4 top) booths and 10 stools at a counter. Once in the door, there is a lectern with the sign-in sheet, on the left are 6 booths running to the back, and on the right are 2 booths near the door, then a sealed off kitchen area with a narrow counter and 10 stools for individual diners. They have lots of interesting, retro 70's, Japanese advertisement signs as dÃƒÅ’Ã‚Â©cor throughout the restaurant. The staff is very friendly, waitresses and cooks will loudly greet customers in Japanese upon entry and exit. ""Cash Only"" is the strict policy at Daikokuya. Make sure that you bring along some cash, or stop by an ATM once you find parking. There are no ATM's nearby. So you may have to find an ATM in the Japanese Village Mall across the street. The parking situation in J-Town ranges from ""terrible"" to ""crazy"". The street meters charge almost $2.00/hour (25 cents per 8 minutes) and the parking lots nearby are also very expensive. It's a tourist area, so make sure that you allocate some extra time to find parking and walking time to and from the parking, once you find it. Be forewarned that there is usually a very long wait for a table. Put your name on the sign-in sheet and be ready to wait. There are lots of little shops around and there is a nice coffee shop in the Japanese Village Mall across the street. A good strategy to avoid the wait is to arrive for lunch at 11:00am when they open. You won't have to wait for a table and it's actually possible at that time to get street parking.Daikokuya is all about ramen and their tonkotsu soup stock. Tonkotsu is all about pork and pork fat. If you don't like fatty meats, then you should stay away from Daikokuya and not read the rest of this review. If fat makes you uncomfortable, go down the street and get some sushi, don't have ramen. Pork and pork fat is the main flavoring ingredient in tonkotsu. Daikokuya starts the tonkotsu by boiling pork bones and joints in a large cauldron all throughout the night reducing it down to concentrate the flavor and to properly extract all the collagen from the cartilage and soft tissue. The collagen is what gives great tonkotsu the richness and slight stickiness between your lips without it being oily. The tonkotsu is then infused with their secret blended soysauce and they then add al dente cooked ""Chijire style"" egg noodles (slightly curly), Kurobuta (black pig, extra fatty) pork belly chashu, marinated medium boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds to complete the ramen. The Little Tokyo location of Daikokuya offers an option on the menu to order ""Kotteri"" style tonkotsu. The menu states ""** for all tonkotsu fanatics: ask for the richer, kotteri flavor which uses added soup extracted from the back fat"". Getting the ""Kotteri"" option is a must! The best Kotteri will actually have visible, little bits of pork fat floating in the soup stock and have an added richness and intensity. The standard Daikokuya Ramen is $8.95. I ordered the Kotteri, Tonkotsu Ramen combo with a small Chicken Egg Bowl for $12.50. The kotteri tonkotsu was amazing. It was light colored and had the little bits of floating fat and an intense pork flavor without being overly salty. The standard noodles were cooked medium firm and delicious. You can ask for firmer or softer noodles. The marinated egg was medium boiled, soft in the middle but not runny. It was an awesome bowl of ramen. Along with the combo order, you get a small salad of shredded cabbage with dressing that is very tasty. My Chicken and Egg bowl had chunks of thicken thigh with scrambled egg on top of rice with special soy sauce. It was very tasty, but definitely secondary to the ramen. Daikokuya's ramen definitely lived up their reputation as one of the best in L.A. I had a great experience at Daikokuya and really appreciate all the great ramen that can be found in Southern California.",5
"I'm really glad that we did not have to wait more than 10 minutes to eat here, because Daikokuya was good, but unremarkable to me. There was absolutely nothing about this ramen that stood out. Everything was just good. I tend to like a lot of different ingredients (vegetables especially) in my ramen, whereas this is more for people who like it simple. Just some pork broth, noodles, green onion, chashu, and an egg. I think you can add sprouts too but that's basically it. For something special try Chibiscus in Hollywood. They flavor and sear their pork beforehand--it's soooo good.Verdict: Good, but I wouldn't crave it.",3
"Overall: Matches the hype, best ramen I've had in LA.What I've had: Daikoku Ramen, Spicy Miso Ramen, Eel bowlWhat I don't like: The line takes forever, so go during non-peak hours. It's worth blocking out the time.Other tips: Cash only!",5
"It was suggested that I try this place as a true ramenholic.After attending one of my 12 step program meetings ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_to cure my ramen addiction, I happened to walk by Daikokuya and saw an empty booth! I dragged my Mother into the restaurant and proceeded to scour the menu for the various options to feed my ramen addiction. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I thought this was a Ramenya, so I thought I had more choices that the tonkotsu ramen, kotteri syle or no kotteri... Ramen is a very subjective dish. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_With so many components it really comes down to what YOUR preferences are. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_As a noodleholic first, ramenholic second, my first concern are the noodles, they just HAVE to be the yellow, slightly curly, thicker noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_And not the white, straight and thin noodles. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_These noodles are A, number 1 here.Broth, very good Kotteri flavor (added soup extracted from the back fat) added to the tonkotus,the thicker broth with the added flavor! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_ What no fried onions? ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Oh well...Menma (bamboo) 1tess.wordpress.com/2008Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_ was very good and the egg! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_OMGosh! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The egg is very important as well. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_First of all, it is a whole egg, not cut in half and drum roll... ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It was a soft boiled egg! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_perfect! Two slices of pork belly, what more could a hungry Ramenholic want as a topping on their ramen! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Scallions and bean sprouts finish the topping and the relationship worked cohesively in the bowl.Mom ordered the Chow Mein aka Yakisoba yelp.com/biz_photos/iSZpÃ¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒâ€º_. It was a tad sweet, not what I am normally accustomed to. Very good, made with the ramen noodles.Bought fried rice for the hubby to go. Very well made with imitation crab - sorry, no pic as he came home as I was walking Shiro and it was consumed in my absence. Tonkotsu Kotteri Ramen - 5 Stars ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Disappointed that they only had two choices, Tonkotsu and Tonkotsu with Kotteri Chow mein aka Yakisoba - 31/2 Stars Mom and I both did not care too much for the sweeter tasteFried rice - 4 StarsNeedless to say, my ramen addiction will be nursed with their ramen.",4
"Daikokuya is representative of what makes Los Angeles one of the greatest places on Earth. After a brief drive past Skid Row, you end up in Little Tokyo and have what seems like a thousand different Japanese dining options to choose from. Thanks to yelp, our party of five ended up at Daikokuya. The wait was not as bad as it could have been. We waited about 25 minutes for a table, and we provided excellent service the entire time. Once you step inside, it's like you're no longer in Los Angeles. The place has a real nice vibe providing a feel good experience for all your senses. The thing that was shocking to me was the price of everything...in a good way. A bento box with three different options for $13.50? Seriously? Us East Coast folks spend that much on a mediocre lunch most days. The ramen, the teriyaki, the tuna rolls, the miso soup, even the salad here is awesome. Definitely a highlight of our trip. Tough out the wait because it is totally worth it!",4
"I came back here after gorging myself on cupcakes and even though I was full I felt like coming in anyway, remembering the creamy, pork flavor of the ramen. The pork cutlet didn't disappoint but the broth wasn't as rich as I remember. The garnish wasn't so plentiful nor crunchy. The fried rice was still good-but they seem to keep skimping on the garnish. The little red peppers that added the little spice were noticeably less than before. My visits to LA are few and far between enough that I'll come back and visit again but my expectations will be that much lower. *Sigh*",3
"What?! How have I not reviewed Daikokuya?!Okay, so I've been here several times. I used to say this was THE BEST RAMEN in SOCAL! But now I'm not so sure anymore. I don't know if their broth changed or what, but when I went recently, it didn't taste as amazing as it did before. We waited an hour to get seated, our food came out fast, and the service was friendly and quick. But the ramen... it just wasn't as flavorful and as delicious as I remembered. I love how the noodles are slightly on the harder side though! But the broth.. hmm.. it was missing that pizzazz that I once knew. Even putting in a lot of ginger didn't do it for me.If you're hungry or it's your first time there, DEFINITELY get the ramen combo that comes with the shredded pork bowl! That bowl is sooo good! It may even be the redeeming factor of your meal if you're not enjoying the ramen as much. And the two just go so well together!Parking sucks. You can get street parking if you're lucky or park in the structure across the street.",4
"The best ramen in LA, period. Wait lines are inevitable lol but worth it. The great thing is that you can check out other things in Little Tokyo while you wait. Wish they'd open up another one right next to it so we can actually eat and get on our way though. Food wise, the broth is the thickest, most flavorful, chasu is soft, and don't forget to ask for the extra fat juice because it makes a world of a difference. I'd say for regular non spicy, it's the best. If you like spicy ramen, this isn't the spot because the spice is not spicy. Overall, 5 stars rated for ramen! the pork based is what you'd want to try if this is your first time!",5
"Just come...trust me and everyone else that has been here. Stop filibustering and yelping for a better place. I mean, they send their staff to Japan for training....to Japan!! Across an ocean!!! Just to serve you the most amazing, deeply flavored, sensual porky broth made from scratch and designed to hyper-stimulate your every sense. Don't hesitate...don't ask around. Yeah the wait is long (which should tell you something) but aren't the best things in life worth waiting for? Come and dive deep into a bowl of glorious deliciousness. I'm an addict. Not afraid to admit it. Won't quit.",5
"Mmm. Can't go wrong with a hot bowl of ramen and a side of their fried rice. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_CASH ONLY, folks! And the wait can be a little ridiculous, so make sure you put your name down before you start walking around Little Tokyo. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_But don't stray too far! Sometimes people end up leaving so the list is a lot shorter than you'd think. :)",5
"The egg. My friend who makes fun of my love affair with eggs thought this was a tasty egg too. Broth is tasty, noodles are perfect. A very filling meal will run you just under $10 and it's worth every moment of a cold, rainy wait. The smaller your group, the easier you are to seat. Just FYI.",5
"A line out the door before opening is always enticing, so my boyfriend and I decided to put our name down on the growing list of names waiting for a steaming hot bowl of ramen. I had the daikokuya ramen, which comes with a generous portion of chewy noodles, bamboo shoots, green onions, soft-boiled egg, and chashu pork. The broth is extremely flavorful, and I loved the texture of the noodles. The pork bowl was also a great addition to the meal, with deliciously marinated pork over a bed of rice. Little Tokyo boasts a large array of ramen, sushi, and other Japanese food, but Daikokuya is definitely one to try if you're unsure where to go!",4
"This place has been around forever. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_There is usually a wait of at least 20 minutes, but it's definitely well worth it.I ordered the combination Daikokuya ramen and chicken teri bowl. This is the best ramen you will have ever have. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The broth is delicious! It has a rich meaty taste to it. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I usually order the ramen with extra kotteri flavor (basically it's soup base extracted from pork back fat). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The chicken teriyaki is also an exceptional dish. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The chicken skin is slightly crispy and the chicken is lightly glazed, not too sweet.The place looks like a Japanese diner with vintage Japanese posters and decorations. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Very cool. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food is excellent and the service was good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Expect to spend about $15 per person.",5
"Seriously good Ramen, as evidence of the long wait times they have even on weekdays. The place is a small hole in the wall but the food is so good! The wait is worth it, trust me and every other person that has said the same :D The broth had a deliciously complex and hearty flavor that reminded me of good old fashion home cooked meals. Love this place and can't wait to go back!",5
There are ramen houses in ghettos that taste better. Salad was amazing. Beef is bland miso watery with little taste. Overrated hype. Cash only no parking 1 hour wait minimum,3
"Came on a Sat afternoon. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The wait wasn't dreadful, about 35 mins. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I expected an hour wait so I was grinning like an idiot when my name was called after only 35 minutes. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I had to try their ramen since it's #9 on the list of top 10 ramen houses in LA according to LA Weekly (11/7/13 edition). ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Now I've eaten at 4 shops, 6 more to go.This shop is a classic. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_It is old, like well broken in old. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The decor is old style Japanese, with classic Japanese movie posters on the walls (not Godzilla posters ).I had the combo: Ramen &amp; small beef bowl. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_for $12.95. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I asked for my ramen Kotteri style. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I heard that's the recommended way to go. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The food was very good. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The ramen was very flavorful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The soup was rich &amp; delicious. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Sitting next to me at the counter were 2 beautiful French tourists, Beatrice &amp; Marie. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Picture the scene: 2 beautiful women speaking a beautiful language having delicious ramen with ya on a beautiful Los Angeles afternoon...not bad, huh?!",4
"DELICIOUS! It's my favorite ramen place in Los Angeles so far. The only thing is sometimes the line gets extremely long. Once, my friends and I put our names down, went to a bar nearby for an hour and a half, came back and it was still not our turn. Sad face. Other than that, the ramen is seriously to die for! Very comparable to Ippudo in NYC (which is apparently one of the best ramen places in NYC). Yum, I like!",5
"Meh, I don't see why this place has a crazy wait. My friends and I tried this place on a Thursday night at about 8:30PM. We waited approximately 40 minutes for a table! (You gotta love the inconsiderate kids that sit around and hold conversations of mindless drivel, when they've been done eating for the past 20 minutes, even though they see a ton of people waiting to sit. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Which is actually common for places like this.)Well, I was hoping that the wait would be worth it, but sadly it wasn't. The ramen was good but not 40 minute wait good. I don't like how they put bean sprouts in it and the broth was a tad bit salty for my taste. The noodles were cooked well and the slices of pork and the egg were good additions. The fried rice was good also, so was the sausage.However, after hearing all these great things about the ramen, I came away disappointed. While pretty good, it does not come close to Tsujita and it's not THAT great of a place to make people wait that long.",3
"Best. Ramen. Ever.How good could ramen be? How could a bowl of noodle soup be worth an hour's wait? I wondered the same thing, but heard raves from friends and Yelpers alike, so decided to see for myself.I came. I waited. I ate. I converted.Words can hardly describe why; you just have to believe the hype and taste for yourself.I mean, it's just noodle soup. But it's the best noodle soup in the history of ramen noodle soups. No exaggeration.Okay?",5
I don't think it's worth the wait. I feel as though the volume is getting in the way of making a delicious ramen with a legendary service. Do you even care about your customers anymore? If yall are just bitches just here to eat i think it does a good job to serve your palate and feel your belly i think. #imo,2
"I think the 3000+ reviews for this place speaks for itself. You know the place is good when there is a huge line waiting outside on a hot summer day for hot ramen. I've heard about how long lines get for this place and have seen it myself. Luckily I came here before the dinner rush and didn't have to wait that long. Place is very small and only has about 7 or 8 booths and the rest are seats along the bar. I tried the original ramen which is what you should try if it is your first time here. I don't eat a lot of ramen but it is definitely the best tasting ramen I've had. The broth is full of flavor, a little salty, and can be very addicting. It is one of the top reviewed places on yelp so it is a must try spot.",4
"Even though it is a small venue, the house ramen has some of the best flavors. I opted for the richer version which uses kotteri (back fat) for the broth - make sure you ask for it! The flavor of the Kurobuta pork belly chashu, boiled egg and noodles were the perfect accompaniment to the rich, flavor filled, porkiness of the broth. .Get there early as it packed almost as soon as the doors open. The servers are quick, precise, attentive and super friendly.",5
Another Yelp top 10 restaurant visit.Had to get the richer kotteri flavor ramen. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Tasty but I would've liked it to have been even more richer and thicker (aka fatter) for the ultimate 5/5 rating.For a place known for it's ramen I was really surprised that there was only one type of ramen on their menu.,4
"First time here, recommended by a friend, I ordered the Daikokuya ramen and it is delicious! Fast service too, definitely bringing friends and family next time",5
Worth the wait! Loved our meal here! Be prepared to wait... We went in the middle afternoon and probably waited an hour and half. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We actually didn't mind waiting and were able to sit inside. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_The dumplings were so hot and fresh!! Everything tastes just so fresh! The salad is delicious. The ramen was wonderful. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Ordered way to much food and they were great to box the leftovers. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Staff was nice also. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Cash only. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Glad we were able to go.,5
"UGH. What? I don't GET IT. What is the hype? I've given this a fair shot, really. Noodles are too chewy, the meat is unmemorable - in fact, the whole experience is pretty unmemorable. The only thing that sticks out are the too chewy noodles and an unnecessarily long wait. Go to Shin-Sen-Gumi instead. Or don't, because that's where I'll be and I don't want you to add to MY wait time.",2
"I love Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I would drive four hours to LA just to get Daikokuya. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_I have only been to the original location in Downtown LA. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_All the other reviews hit the spot, but one thing I would suggest is go early. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_They open at 11am, and we got there at 11:45am once, and there was a wait already. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Get there early! ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_Do not wait until you are starving to go; you might not make it! Enjoy!",5
"now i know why everyone is down to pay $8 for parking, sit in traffic, and wait more than 40 minutes just to eat here! the ramen at daikokuya is ""THE BOMB""specialty ramen is what they're known for. everything was superb. from the portion size, noodles, broth, egg, chashu, and the piles of green onions! wow! amazing! you can definitely taste the richness in the broth and the strong tonkotsu pork flavor. it was so delicious! i wish there was a choice to make it spicy but i did add some ""nanami togarashi"" which is japanese chili powder. the chashu was so flavorful and it will literally melt in your mouth. it had an even portion of fat and meat to it. the soft boiled egg was also made perfect and the piles of huge green onions just made the cherry on top.service here is excellent. the waiting list was called accordingly in order. they were very organized and handled the busy crowd well. 5 stars for that! i had to take a star off because it is rare to find street parking so you have to end up paying $8 just to park. the wait was pretty long but i already expected that.",4
"Worth the wait in line. Cute, classic, little and reminds me of the the places I've been in Tokyo.",5
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place. The ramen was okay, not mind-blowing or anything and not even close to the broth at tsujita. I got the combo with the teriyaki chicken and salad, which were both good. I just don't get why there is such a long line here when I feel like the standard of ramen is probably the same at every other place.",3
there is a reason why there is always a line. Its worth the wait.They still have one of the best pork broths,4
"So today was my first time at Daikokuya. We heard and read so much about this place. We got there at about 5:30 pm on a Monday (15 minute wait). We are a family of four. We ordered 2 spicey miso ramen combo's; one with the shredded pork belly bowl, and the other with the teriyaki eel bowl. The ramen was ok. Sorry but the last ramen we had was the tantan-men at Chin-Ma-Ya and the miso ramen didn't come close. The eel and shredded pork bowls were good, as were the california rolls and gyoza. My daughters got 2 bento boxes with teriyaki chicken and tempura. The tempura was ok and chicken just ok. ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_We also ordered the iichiko yuzu, ramune soda, and lemonades. Overall it was a good meal but nothing extraordinary. I will continue to look for my new ramen house.",3
"For how many people rave about this place and the hour and a half wait, I don't understand what the hype is about. I could totally cook instant ramen better than what I ate here.... The broth wasn't rich and the noodle texture was whatever. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is from the fact that their dumplings were good.If you want a place to set a benchmark for great ramen, go to ippudo in New York.... Now that is what you call great ramen. *annoyed ranting roar*",2
"The hype is real. Authentic Japanese atmosphere.I stopped by Little Tokyo with a friend and he recommended that we eat here. It was my first time here, and I had high expectations because of the yelp reviews.At first, we were discouraged because there were 12 parties ahead of us on the wait sheet. We put our names down around 4pm on a Saturday. We then walked around the area and came back 20mins later and saw that only 4 groups got seated so far. We just chilled inside the small restaurant for another 40mins and finally got seated. Insane that we waited an hour for just us two. But after, it was definitely worthwhile. I ordered the ramen +chicken teriyaki bowl combo for about $13. The ramen is tastier than shin sen gumi, and the teriyaki bowl compliments the ramen nicely. Shin sen gumi's ramen doesn't compare. Definitely try this authentic Japanese restaurant regardless of how long the wait is because it'll be worth it. I'm coming back forsure.",5
"I LUFF POACHED EGGS! I LUFF RAMEN! I LUFF SOUP! I LUFF SALMON ROEEE!Prices are reasonable. Big portions. Lots of flavaflavvv.Luckily, we got here early to beat the lines. Waited for a few minutes an got seated real quick for dindin.I ordered their Daikokuya Ramen and Salmon Roe bowl combination. Very yummmy! :o) My other two gfs got their ramens with Chicken Egg bowl which was also very yummy. Their soup base is bomb.com and their ramen is not too chewy but just PERFECT. Luff it!Every meal comes with salad and I really like their dressing.Parking is a b*tch but it's Little Tokyo, what can you expect?",4
We saw reviews online before we decided to come here. And have to say that food is really good. And it's little busy friendly place. Very very busy . good place . recommended,5
"I've been to a couple of other ramen places, but I really like Daikokuya. Their broth is a little bit on the saltier side but it tastes like it has so much depth to it. The meat is incredibly delicious and it just melts in your mouth and the egg is cooked to soft boiled perfection. I had the spicy miso ramen and my boyfriend had the Daikokuya ramen. I think I like the flavor of the broth from his better. I would say expect to wait anywhere from 45 min. + to get seated, so head over there when you're feeling a bit hungry and once you're seated you'll be starving and the food will taste even better :) this place definitely hits the spot if you're craving ramen.",5
"I don't know how to feel about this so-called ""Best Ramen in LA."" Went here this weekend and while it was delicious, I don't know if it truly is the best of the best. I've tried the Daikokuya Ramen, the gyoza, and the sushi here. Everything seemed pretty standard for a Japanese restaurant. The broth of the ramen was extremely flavorful and it is definitely crave-worthy. The sushi was nothing special but still above-average. I liked the gyoza but again, nothing spectacular. Things get so over-hyped in downtown LA. Before you know it, everyone is blogging about a place that the cyber glitterati ÃƒÂ¥Ãƒ_are all migrating to for the next 'must-have' dish. I sadly believe this has happened with Daikokuya. While it is a good Japanese restaurant, I don't think I deserve to wait in a line like I'm going on Space Mountain at Disney Land. There are other great ramen places all over Little Tokyo, so if I can't get a table here it's not a huge deal to me. ...Oh! CASH ONLY, waaah :'(""The beef bowl was not as good as I would have hoped. Otherwise, everything was great, the service was excellent and I love the interior design of the place.",3
